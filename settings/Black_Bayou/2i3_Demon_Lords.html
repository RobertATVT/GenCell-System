</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
The hierarchical armies of the Dark are set up much like the mortal armies of the world.  The lesser demons (or simply, demons) represent the foot soldiers and spies of the demonic army.  They infiltrate mortality, corrupting them firsthand while setting them up for failure at every turn.  Then, there are the demon spawn.  The warrior creed that rely on pure ferocity to crush the enemies of the Dark.  Finally, there are the demon lords. The generals of the Dark's armies.<BR>
<BR>
There is only one demon lord assigned to any general area (all of Isle Voletta is considered an area).  All of the demons that reside within that area are considered to be under the command on the demon lord that controls the area.  They are loyal servants to the demon lord, and the horde will generally work together to further the ends of the Dark.  Due to the chaotic Demonic control, The Dark notifies the Demon Lord upon any new Demons placed in the area and any Demons removed so that the Demon Lord may make plans and coordinate their missions.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Please note:</B>  There may only be one demon lord at a time in Isle Voletta.  The following masteries are listed for informational purposes only.  Regardless of their level in Demon Lore, no character would have any idea these masteries exist in-character, except the Archangel (since Demon Lore level 3 is mandatory).  Not even if a character had been a Demon Lord in the past - the knowledge of their existence would have been erased.  Demon Lords are bound by their service to the Dark not to disclose the existence of these abilities and no attempts to Mind Scrye their existence will succeed.  These are the secret tools of the Dark itself and are guarded as such.  If the current Demon Lord leaves, the replacement Demon Lord must have (at the minimum) an approved Demon Character Sheet at least six months old and Lore level 3 in Demon AND Angel.  The Demon Lord must roleplay their character at least 5 days during each character sheet update period.  The final decision on the new Demon Lord is decided upon by the Dark.<BR>

System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs Victim 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>With a simple gesture, a Demon Lord with this mastery can curse an individual within line of sight, giving them a better chance to fail at everything they do.  For every two points over the victim's roll the Demon Lord scores, the victim receives -1 to any and all non-combat die rolls for the duration of the mastery.  Combat die rolls are made at -2 for every point over the victim's roll. (Rolls can never force a character sheet to go below 0, additional points are just tossed aside)  Furthermore, anyone around the victim will feel instinctively uneasy in their presence, regardless of their relationships.  Animals will react strangely as well, either growling or hissing at them or running in fear, as appropriate for the species.  Characters in an animal form will react as other animals of the same species would, again regardless of their relationship to the victim.  If the victim roll is greater than the Demon Lords, the opposite effect will occur with any negatives rebounding back on the servant of Dark.  If the victim happens to roll double 6's, the whiplash causes the Demon Lord to be stunned for one round and this mastery instantly dissipates, this phenomena also makes it impossible for the Demon Lord to cast it again that night.  If the Demon Lord rolls double 6's (and the victim doesn't), the victim receives the full effect of the Curse.  Any roll they attempt will automatically fail for the duration of the Mastery as well as the other items listed above are intensified tenfold.<BR>

System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Permanent; takes 5 minutes to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description:</B><I> </I>One of the most obvious examples of a powerful demon's ability to corrupt is the spreading of diseases and afflictions.  With but a touch and a five minute prayer, a Demon Lord with this hideous power can bring forth the effects of any disease known to man in the victim.  These affects are not commonly noticed immediately as the Demon Lord merely plants the seeds of the virus and the disease runs it's course.  These diseases may not be of the quick kill variety.  Meaning, if the disease can kill it's victim, it must take the disease two weeks or longer to do so.  If there is a medical cure for the disease (or through the use of the Miracle mastery), it may be used to eliminate the virus.  Alternately, the Demon Lord may strike the victim with some other permanent affliction.  Whether it be blindness, deafness or similar devastating effect.  This ability is rarely used as most Demon Lords prefer to infect a victim with a disease that will eventually end up with the same results.  This mastery may only be used on the same individual once per month.  In the case of disease, the victim will be unaware they have been infected until the symptoms begin to appear.  This mastery may not be used to alter any character's breed.<BR>

Effect/Description:  </B>Aside from the normal duties of a demon, a Demon Lord is also responsible for keeping an eye on the members of their horde, looking for signs of disobedience.  By simply making eye contact, the Demon Lord can peer into the thoughts and memories of any of their fellow demons.  The Demon Lord does not have to be visible to activate this mastery.  The demon being probed would be completely unaware of the Demon Lord's actions.  In fact, only demons achieving this lofty status know this ability exists. <BR>

Effect/Description: </B>A Demon Lord is a being that has transcended the need for a physical form.  In fact, their native form is that of a spirit, a being a pure energy.  As such, they have the ability to materialize and dematerialize at will.  While in this natural state, space and time hold no meaning for them.  This does not mean they may travel back and forth through time at will.  It means the Demon Lord may appear anywhere they choose instantly.  A dematerialized Demon Lord may not be detected in any way.  They are completely invisible to all the senses, including extraordinary ones.  This means they are also immune to all forms of attack and may not be targeted by any masteries, except the Mindspeak of members in their horde.  Transcendent beings that encounter each other are able to interact  as normal.  Many times, high ranking spiritual beings battle each other in the mortal world without humanity ever knowing.<BR>

<I>The Demon Lord spot is a very special position.  There is to be only one Demon Lord at any one given time.  Applications may be sent in but will only be saved on file should there already be a Demon Lord in place.  At the time when the present Demon Lord is no longer holding that position a new Demon Lord will be chosen... then and only then.</I></P></HTML>
