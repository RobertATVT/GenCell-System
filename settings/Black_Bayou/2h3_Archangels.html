The hierarchical armies of the Light are set up much like the mortal armies of the world.  The lesser angels (or simply, angels) represent the foot soldiers and active promoters of righteousness for the angelic army.  They aid the mortals, cleansing them and helping them resist temptation firsthand.  Then, there are the herald angels.  The warrior creed that rely on the Light's pure energies to crush the enemies of the righteous.  Finally, there are the archangels.  The generals of the Light's armies.<BR>
<BR>
There is only one archangel assigned to any general area (all of Isle Voletta is considered an area).  All of the angels that reside within that area are considered to be under the guidance of the archangel that controls the area.  They are loyal servants to the archangel, and the flock will always work together to further the ends of the Light.  Due to the importance of Angelic coordination, The Light notifies the Archangel upon any new Angels placed in the area and any Angels removed so that the Archangel may make plans and coordinate their missions.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Please note:</B>  There may only be one archangel at a time in Isle Voletta.  These masteries are listed for informational purposes only.  Regardless of their level in Angel Lore, no character would have any idea these masteries exist in-character, except the Demon Lord (Since Demon Lore level 3 is mandatory).  Not even if a character had been an Archangel in the past - the knowledge of their existence would have been erased.  Archangels are bound by their service to the Light not to disclose the existence of these abilities and no attempts to Mind Scrye their existence will succeed.  These are the secret tools of the Light itself and are guarded as such.  If the current Archangel leaves, the replacement Archangel must have (at the minimum) an approved Angel Character Sheet at least six months old and Lore level 3 in Angel AND Demon.  The Archangel must roleplay their character at least 5 days during each character sheet update period.  The final decision on the new Archangel is decided upon by the Light.  <BR>

Effect/Description: </B>With a simple prayer, an Archangel with this mastery can bless an individual within line of sight, giving them a better chance to succeed in their actions.  For every two points over 20 the Archangel scores, the victim receives +1 to any and all die rolls for the duration of the mastery.  Should the recipient of the blessing take any sort of offensive action during this time (attacking physically, mentally or spiritually, for instance), then they will suffer an adverse effect.  When the mastery ends, the victim will suffer a penalty twice as powerful as the blessing for twice the duration.  For instance, if a victim was blessed with +3 to all die rolls for 4 rounds and attacked someone else during that time, at the end of 4 rounds they would suffer a -6 penalty to all die rolls for the following 8 rounds.  Furthermore, anyone around the victim will feel instinctively at ease in there presence, regardless of their relationships.  Animals will react friendly as well.  Characters in an animal form will react as other animals of the same species would, again regardless of their relationship to the victim.  If the Archangel rolls double 6s, all of the recipients rolls will automatically succeed for the duration of the mastery, combat and non-combat rules still are as explained above.<BR>

Effect/Description:  </B>Aside from the normal duties of an angel, an Archangel is also responsible for keeping an eye on the members of their flock, looking for signs of corruption.  By simply making eye contact, the Archangel can peer into the thoughts and memories of any of their fellow angels.  The Archangel does not have to be visible to activate this mastery.  The angel being probed would be completely unaware of the Archangel's actions.  In fact, only angels achieving this lofty status know this ability exists. <BR>

System/Duration: </B>N/A / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>Miracles come in many shapes and forms.  This mastery grants an Archangel the ability to perform many minor miracles from resurrecting plants to walking on water with no roll required or soul expenditure necessary, at the ST's discretion.  Additionally, the Archangel has the ability to heal any wound, disease, disability or resurrect a slain character simply by touching the target and exerting their will.  To resurrect, the slain must be dead for less than 24 hours, but character breed or way of death (i.e. Lore) does not matter.  Only a fragment of the slain's body is necessary for this mastery to work.  The healing aspects of this mastery may only be used once per night on any single target and resurrection can only be used once a night.  This mastery may not be used to alter any character's breed.  <BR>

Effect/Description: </B>An Archangel is a being that has transcended the need for a physical form.  In fact, their native form is that of a spirit, a being a pure energy.  As such, they have the ability to materialize and dematerialize at will.  While in this natural state, space and time hold no meaning for them.  This does not mean they may travel back and forth through time at will.  It means the Archangel may appear anywhere they choose instantly.  A dematerialized Archangel may not be detected in any way.  They are completely invisible to all the senses, including extraordinary ones.  This means they are also immune to all forms of attack and may not be targeted by any masteries, except the Mindspeak of members in their flock.  Transcendent beings that encounter each other are able to interact  as normal.  Many times, high ranking spiritual beings battle each other in the mortal world without humanity ever knowing.<BR>

<I>The Archangel spot is a very special position.  There is to be only one Archangel at any one given time.  Applications may be sent in but will only be saved on file should there already be an Archangel in place.  At the time when the present Archangel is no longer holding that position a new Archangel will be chosen... then and only then.</I></P></HTML>
