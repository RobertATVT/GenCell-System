When you think of a wolf, what comes to mind?  The nasty beast dressed up like a sweet little grandmother to fool Little Red Riding Hood?  The big bad wolf that blew the Three Little Pigs house down?  In many fairy tales and cartoons wolves are portrayed as sly and sneaky, or just plain mean.  Like most wild animals, though, they seldom seek out confrontations with humans or other wolf packs, unless the latter has crossed into their territory.<BR>
<BR>
Wolves are beautiful, intelligent animals who are loyal to each other. They like company and live in packs - the pack always has a leader, the Alpha, chosen for his strength, wisdom, and cunning.  Wolf families are affectionate and cooperative. They play and hunt together.  They protect each other, too. If one wolf finds itself in some sort of trouble, the others will try to help it. A wolf does live alone, but it is a hard life without the safety of the pack.  Lone wolves often die. <BR>
<BR>
A werewolf is a mortal with a genetic virus. This virus, transmitted by the bite of another werewolf, merges itself with the cells of the mortal. There is no known cure. The werewolf appears to be a normal mortal in all respects. It is now half-man half-beast, however. A monstrous force dwells deep within the werewolf's soul, constantly searching for an opportunity to escape. This, coupled with the raw instinct that occasionally overcomes a werewolf, makes the newly created among them rather dangerous, that is, until they learn to control their newfound animal natures.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B> To become a werewolf, you must first be chosen by the creator.  This werewolf must spend 6 hours in a ritual (must be posted) in which they focus on their target. Dancing around a bonfire, occasionally tossing in something personal of the werewolf-to-be.  At the conclusion of the ritual, the werewolf goes immediately Horus and then tracks down the target. The tracking is automatic and the Horus will take whatever means necessary to reach the target. Once the hunt has ended, the werewolf will attack the target, attempting to bite them.  Unfortunately for most, the Horus is a maddened beast nearly impossible to control.  In order for the werewolf to control itself and not kill the target, they must attempt to control the insane beast they have become.  To do so, they must successfully roll 2d6+Will vs. TN: 20.  Werewolves no longer roll this after 4 months of their own breed generation as they have learned to control the beast inside just enough.  If the Werewolf is 4 months or older AND has a Will stat of 20 or more, they can create a Werewolf without an ST or GM being present.  This siring must be posted in the STs lair and the CSs verified before the incident is considered official.  If the intended target resists the bite, none of the above applies as an ST or GM must be there.  If the Werewolf is NOT 4 months old and/or has a Will less than 20, this roll must be witnessed by either a GM or ST.  If the Werewolf fails this roll, they tear the victim to pieces in a blind rage.  Should this roll be successful, as well as a successful attack roll for the bite itself, the green froth around its mouth enters the targets bloodstream. One bite is enough and the Horus will immediately flee, having bitten its target. Over the next few days or weeks, the virus will work its way through the target's body.  On the night of the next full moon, the target will unexpectedly fly into Horus for the first time and will immediately begin a hunt.  The player must then roll 2d6+Will vs a TN of 24.  Success means the werewolf will find the scent of and track down their intended target.  If the roll is failed, the creature will follow any scents of people, wherever they lead.  It is not unheard of for a werewolf to attack a city or town during its first transformation.  In fact, that is where some of the rumors about werewolf attacks occurring during the full moon come form.  Once it kills its first victim, (for gaming purposes, once it has reduced the CS to negative numbers) the newly created werewolf will change back to mortal form, the curse complete (this must be witnessed by a GM or ST and posted).  If the werewolf is killed in its attack (Body reduced to negative its Body total as per the Mortal breed) they will die as they haven't completely reverted to werewolf until AFTER successfully accomplishing this attack.  If there is some reason that the werewolf-to-be missed the full moon (captured underground, etc.) they will turn Horus each evening upon return/release (once they can see the sky again) during the hours of darkness until they either kill a victim or are killed themselves.<BR>

However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the werewolf is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to a werewolf, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.  Werewolves age at a very reduced rate and could theoretically live almost forever.<BR>

Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue. You believe simply shooting a werewolf with a silver bullet will kill them. You believe them to be creatures of the night who change into a horrific beast by the light of a full moon. You believe there are physical signs of the werewolf (unibrow, fingers of the same length, etc.) You believe they cannot touch silver objects. You are wary of the dreaded bite of the werewolf, as you still believe a random bite will curse you as well.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Wolfsbane:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Wolfsbane is a plant of varying size originally found in Europe.  How the plant managed to make its way to the United States is anyone's guess.  The spores of this plant that grow just beneath the petals of the yellowish flowers are believed to have a particularly distasteful odor that can only be noticed by canines.  Whether this is true or not is irrelevant.  It's the faith in the horrible stench of the herb that causes werewolves to be repulsed by it.  Wolfsbane can be found in most herbal shops around the country.  Holding the wolfsbane aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the herb and the werewolf they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the werewolf's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the werewolf's roll, they are successful.  The werewolf must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the werewolf from fleeing until the duration wears off and it even works on a werewolf in Horus form.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the werewolf may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the werewolf will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the werewolf is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of wolfsbane will only serve to enrage the werewolf, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  The werewolf will also change into their Horus form (if not already there) unless they attempt to resist the change with a standard roll.  It is not possible for one werewolf to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>

Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false. You believe that any type of silver can kill a werewolf, once it enters the bloodstream. You also know that werewolves can shape shift into the form of a wolf. You still believe, however, that the werewolves' change into the monstrous form is related only to the full moon. You also realize merely touching silver has no effect on them. Having studied werewolves for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a werewolf uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the werewolf use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bane Water: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Bane water is little more than water used to boil the wolfsbane herb that has been empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  The water must have been used to boil wolfsbane and posted in the ST's Lair message board area each day it is used.  The empowering with faith must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the bane water in whatever item they intend to attack the werewolf with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of bane water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the werewolf are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the werewolf suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The werewolf must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the werewolf heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Werewolf by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Werewolf, which happens to be Horus.  If you wish to identify the Werewolf as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Werewolf, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Werewolf transform either to or from Horus.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Werewolf.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Silver Bullet:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>To kill a werewolf, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the werewolf's natural healing abilities.  Werewolves happen to be susceptible to a silver bullet that penetrates their brain.  The bullet used must be made of silver.  The bullet has to be a solid slug, like that from a handgun.  Unlike a shotgun loaded with silver pellets that spray over an area.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must fire the silver bullet directly into the fallen werewolf's head.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, focusing it on the bullet as it is fired.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for hitting the prone werewolf so long as the range is point blank.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the silver will kill the werewolf instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if it misses (at long range) it will not kill the werewolf.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  The werewolf will appear to be mortal after it has died.<BR>

This horrifying form, known as Horus, must be role-played as a raging beast, much like a rabid wolf. Rational thought stripped away and pure instinct takes hold.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror. The werewolf can feel the urge of Horus and, if they resist, can hold off the change for no longer than 2 minutes.  If they do not resist, they assume Horus within 30 seconds.  If you conveniently try to leave Horus in order to not take a life in character, then you may be cited with OOC Manipulation.  The Horus has no rational thought and will stop at nothing to rip its victim limb from limb.<BR>

During the new moon, the werewolf if at its most calm and friendly. As the moon nears Crescent and Half, the werewolf's moods begin to grow and intensify. From the Gibbous moon to the Full moon, the werewolf's attitude has worsened to an extent that they are difficult to be around. The intensity of the situation leading to Horus depends on the phase of the moon, as well.<BR>

Anytime even the slightest thing might upset a werewolf during the 3 days that make up a full moon (the day before, day of and day after), they must roll 2d6+Will vs TN: 24.  If this roll is failed, the werewolf will change to Horus, the target being whatever caused the irritation.  After the first three months, the werewolf has learned to control their inner beast enough so they can control the random full moon changes, but not the changes anger brings.<BR>
