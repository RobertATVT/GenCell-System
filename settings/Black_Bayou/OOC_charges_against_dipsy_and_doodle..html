<BR>
During the scene in question, involving Sekmeht Munroe, Victor J Cutter, Lynette Laveau, and myself, Sekmeht hit some pin to send out a distress call to the FBI.  Either HOST ANT Savant or Sekmeht herself proceeded to call in Cat Mason-mun, soon followed up by Cameron Slyger.  Cat Mason was online under her <B>staff</B> name (HOST ANT Demon), who then logged on at 12:37am under Cat Mason to backup Sekmeht.  Cameron Slygar logged on 4 minutes later and to my knowledge wasn't online previously.  He punted shortly afterwards and then logged back on.  They <B>then <U>after</U> the police roll was made for backup </B>proceeded to Role play in the Main Room until the round in the STd session came due.<BR>
<BR>
The charges that I am calling forth are that #1 these types of devices should not be used as masteries as getting masteries for your character through SL's isn't permitted.  The two that I am filing the charges on were not playing under their characters first off, or were not online at all.  Instead they switched in order to come to the scene.  The call for backup (via the pin) went out around 12:20am, a good 17 minutes prior to them switching SN's.  I have the section of the log here to show it:<BR>

If there are </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>no officer player characters online </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>when a crime is reported, a host, Storyteller or Gamemaster will play the role of the officers as non-player characters. We have an official Officer NPC sheet that is used when these situations arise.  However, if a known officer-player is online and role-playing, they will be called <B><I>first</B></I> to handle the situation.  If an officer is online and in need of "Backup", hosts, Storytellers or Gamemasters can be called to role-play non-player character police.  Only BBSTs on staff, Storytellers or Gamemasters may utilize non-player character police.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Verdana" LANG="0"><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></U>	The ST rolls four, two sided dice.  Giving the SD arrival time 4 - 8 rounds.  This is for NPC's Only, the rules for PC cops are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Officer on foot			-  6d2 for arrival (6-12 Combat Rounds)<BR>
Officer not on Patrol		-  4d2 for arrival (4-8 Combat Rounds)<BR>
Officer on Patrol		-  2d2 for arrival (2-4 Combat Rounds)<BR>

(Note that on duty response time only applies to </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><U>CS's actively RPing in the Main Room</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></U> as being on duty and patrolling)</B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Verdana" LANG="0"><BR>
As you can see here, those response times are only for characters that are roleplaying in the MR.  Neither of them were there roleplaying in their characters names and only changed in order to backup Sekmeht.  Thus a blatant violation of OOC knowledge.</HTML>
