A demon is the spiritual embodiment of all that the Dark stands for.  Hate, entropy, deceit, lust, and greed are mere examples of the limitless areas of control they manifest.  They are pieces of the Dark itself, the physical representation of the evil that lives in all of our souls.  Demons work almost exclusively from the shadows, preferring to manipulate the mind and dreams of their victims.  Slowly and methodically they corrupt the souls of mankind, securing the victory for their master during the upcoming apocalypse. It is not unheard of for Demons to fuse their essence with the bodies of those mortals who have willingly relinquished their souls to the Dark (this is where the player characters Demons come from).<BR>

This ensures the mortal receives the great power they request at the cost of its eternal soul.  The mortal may not even be aware the demon has possessed them, but will act as the demon instructs never realizing these actions and thoughts are not their own.  Such is the manipulative power of evil.  The mortal must have accepted the Dark as their master before the demon will have ready access to their body.  Once the possession is completed, the demon is firmly in place, the merging completed.  The merging with the mortal body wipes away all of the demon's masteries, except for its innate special abilities.  Over time, the demon will relearn how to master some of its power using the mortal form they now possess.<BR>

This makes them somewhat immortal.  There is only one thing that can truly kill a demon (see Lore Level 3 below for details).  However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the demon is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to a demon, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Demons.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B></I>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have watched many horror movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You believe demons come in many shapes and sizes.  You may believe they are symbolic in their presence and may not truly exist in the physical world at all.  If they did appear, you might assume they'd be large man-shaped creatures who can fly using their mighty leathery wings.  A demon is a horrifying agent of the dark who can control the minds of all around to further their corruptive ends.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Symbol:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Faith symbols can be any number of items.  Crucifix, Star of David, little golden Buddha, etc.  They must be actual objects, not a pattern sewn into clothing, for instance.  The object itself has absolutely no power whatsoever.  It is the faith of the wielder that empowers the object.  Holding the faith symbol aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the symbol and the demon they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the demon's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the demon's roll, they are successful.  The demon must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the demon from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the demon may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the demon will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the demon is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of a faith symbol will only serve to enrage the demon, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  It is not possible for one demon to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of demons.  Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false.  You know that the destructive nature of fire can burn and seriously injure demons.  You have also discovered that demons are vulnerable to the energies of the light.  Any item embed with its holy energy causes serious wounds to a demon.  When a demon uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the demon use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Water:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>Faith water is little more than water empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the demon with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of faith water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the demon are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the demon suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The demon must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the demon heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>Lore Level 3:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B></I>You have studied demonology most of your life, and perhaps you've even known a few.  You have finally discovered the truth about demons.  You know how they may be divided into different groups (i.e., Demons, Demon Lords, Demon Spawn, etc.).  You also know that they join themselves with mortal hosts in order to directly affect the physical world.  Having studied demons for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a demon uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Demon by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Demon, which happens to be Locust.  If you wish to identify the Locust as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a demon, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the demon transform either to or from Locust.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Demon.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>CWI Dagger:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>A dagger of cold wrought iron is little more than dagger forged from cold rather than heat.  The making of these daggers are too difficult for the average person to make, however they are not rare and can be found in specialty knife shops.  Wrought iron is too soft to be used in combat, however, combat is usually over when the time comes to kill a demon.<B>  </B>To kill a demon, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the demon's natural healing abilities.  Demons happens to be susceptible to a cold wrought iron dagger that penetrates the brain-stem at the base of their skull.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must place the point of the CWI dagger at the base of the demon's skull.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, empowering the CWI dagger.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the CWI dagger must be driven through the demon's neck, severing the brain-stem on the round following the roll.  The empowerment does not last any longer than that.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  As the CWI dagger passes through the demon's brain-stem, the faith the character used to empower it is released, spreading throughout the demon's body.  This causes the body to burn internally and on the following round, the flames will erupt around the body.  Seconds later, nothing will remain of the body as the ashes are extremely thin, disintegrating with any kind of contact.  The spirit of the demon is then dispersed, utterly destroyed.  Since a demon's body has to be in the negative when they are stabbed, they are obviously considered prone.  No attack roll is necessary.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>
