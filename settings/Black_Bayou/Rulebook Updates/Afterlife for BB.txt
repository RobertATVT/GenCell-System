I just thought of a way to possibly...if not solve the problem of needing 2 Hosts per shift, then at least help it.  To review, we would be needing 1 host for the regular room, and 1 for the after life thing.  Well, the host in the after life thing would be the host of heaven, right?  I don't go to church, but I know what the term "Heavenly Host" means.  Tell them theyre God!<BR>

Anyway, another thing I thought of, is that BB is owned by...erm...ANTagonist>Hecklers>Full Moon, right?  Well, conference rooms cost money, and Chamber 1 is just sitting there eating cash.  I think our sponsors would be happy to see that they were finally getting half of their money's worth.  Hmm?  Aye.<BR>
