<B>Sense of Gaia  <I> Costs -2 Soul per use.   (##Sense## / ##Dispel <victim>##) <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6 + Soul vs. TN 14 /  roll 2d6+ Soul vs 2d6+ Mind<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The werewolf has an extremely strong sense of the world around it. The virus itself, by releasing the humans more primal nature has allowed it to have a better understanding of the world around it, including supernatural powers. By using sense the werewolf has the ability to recognize when it is being affected by any Mental mastery. This recognition is subconcious, and they will not reocgnize who did it or which mastery it is unless they have level three Lore in that breed. By taking this power one more step the Werewolf can even attempt to remove the effects of the mastery, for all extents and purpose eliminating the effect.(The second roll is used for dispeling the mastery.) The werewolf would still not recognize the person who used the mastery, however, he would know the nature of the attack if he has Level two Lore or higher. This mastery may only be used twice per night and only -once- per mastery attempt...</HTML>
