Psychics, those who can see into the future.  Many prophets from out history have been graced with the ability to read palms or something similar and KNOW whats in a persons future.  This may be something as mundane as tripping and falling over a person to as extreme as prediciting the next president.  The Psychic sits down and use's a method of fortune telling (Crystal Ball, Rune Stones, Bones, Palm Reading etc...) and depending on the roll they can<BR>
fortell that person future.  The Psychic may then ask in IM's 3 people if there characters have a beef with that person and then based ont he answers the Psychic can then lay out the persons future.  However no Psychic is perfect and the identities of those people will remain a secret.  The Psychic will however "know" that someone is after them (i.e. Paul Psychic Reads Willy Wolfs future.  Paul IM's Lenny Lamia and Lenny says "I am going to pick a<BR>
fight with Willy tonight." Paul can then tell Willy that "I see violence in your future." and thats it.)  But Psychics are wily and don't always have to tell the truth when reading the future.  <BR>

When a psychic reads someones future there is sometimes a "residual" effect that allows psychics to "Bond" mentally with that person.  This bond is stronge and can even cross plains of existence.  The Bond however isn't permemnant and will fade after 3 days, however during those 3 days the bond is incredibly strong and the Psychic will feel all emotions of the person he is bonded to.  If either person is injured the other will feel that damage -1. <BR>
The Bond will also allow the Psychic to "feel" where the other person is and if that person is in trouble Psychics have been known to cross the very gates of hell to protect that person.  If the person is involved in combat, the Psychic will jump in and protect that person at all costs, even it means giving up their own life.</HTML>
