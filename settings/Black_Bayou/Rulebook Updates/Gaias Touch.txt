<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6 + Soul vs. TN 10 / Instant/2 rounds; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Werewolves- bound to the earth as either denizen or protector- share a special bond with nature.  Thus, in dire moments wolves can draw upon this connection to heal themselves of seemingly greivous injuries, be this to strike down an abomination or to lash out against virtue with renewed vigor.  However, this power is not gentle on the surrounding area.  The healing energies come from nature itself and thus plant and, depending upon the energy needed, animal life may suffer.  Plants will wither, crumbling to dust and leaving a barren area around where the character healed himself.  Furthermore, the character must be in contact with the earth for this mastery to work.  In a parking lot he will have to burrow his hand through the gravel and if in the city he must be standing on earth and not concrete or asphalt. For every point rolled above the TN, the wolf regains one Body point and cannot go above his Body Statistic.  This Mastery can only be used once per night.  But as one may well imagine the energies of the earth- no matter the bond- take time to harness and thus expediency diminishes benefit.  If the werewolf is in a stressful situation (i.e. combat, or a situation the ST rules stressful) then the effect of the roll is halved but the effects are instant.  Thus- a character with Soul 5 who activates the power and rolls a 7 will receive 1 Body point instantly if the power is activated during a stressful situation.  Should the character wish to speed up his natural healing process outside of his Homestead, then he must simply meditate and draw the powers into him, thus receiving the full effect of one Body Point for every point rolled over 10.</HTML>
