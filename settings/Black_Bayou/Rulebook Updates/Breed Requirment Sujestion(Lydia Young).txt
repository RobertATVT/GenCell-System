	This is how I sent the thing in to the post boards for player imput. I understand it might be tougher for lamia, but I think it'd be great for psychics. Now as one of the more active psychics in the game I'd be more then happy to have this added restriction. Thank you for your time.<BR>

Well..... How about a solution.<BR>
<BR>
	I can't speak for alll the other non mortal breeds. I'll let some other brillent mind come up with a solution. I gots ta idea for the two mortal breeds, and it's simple.<BR>
<BR>
	Looking at a character sheet... At the top the proud name of our game... Character name... Date... Bla bla... Now what if on the psychic sheet right below all that information the sheet read.... "Focuse Item: " Which had to be filled and upkept with each update.  For the Lamia sheet "Magic Style: " <BR>
<BR>
	So what's the point right? Well... Say your Pharoah (And really, who wouldn't want to say that?) or some other happy ST and you walk into  a ST with Werewolf Billie and Ted the Psychic. You call for your sheets and the setting of the scene... You get Billies sheet (and are taking bets with other ST's how many hits it'll take him to kill the wussy little psychic.. Heh) And you get Ted's sheet... Well you look over Ted's sheet and you see that he for<BR>
some reason has an old flattened foot ball as the focus for his focus for psychic powers. You have the scene explaned too you and Billie and Ted agree that Ted is competely naked in Billies apartment. (Lovers spat? ::Shiver::) You can then very easily go.. "Uh Ted.. No way you have your object, no powers for you!"<BR>
<BR>
	Same idea with the Lamia. You look at Tina the Witch's sheet and see she had "Body Painting" as her magical style and you can stop her from trying to turn into her rat mimicry mastery without first covering herself in finger paint.<BR>
<BR>
	It'd work best in STed things obviously.. But I don't know that there -could- be any problem with this. Thank you for your time.</FONT></HTML>
