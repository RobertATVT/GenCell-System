Just off of Highway 39 on the mainland lays the Bayou Bridge, the only entrance to Isle Voletta for motorists, this two lane steel wonder is just under two miles long.  The island itself is 70 square miles, 14 miles long at the longest point and 8 miles wide, with a beautiful view of the coastlines that surround the isle.  Voletta, the city proper, rests in the southern part of the island, 4 miles by 2 miles and stretches out into the rest of the habitable portion of the isle near double it's size.  Swampland dominates the north western edge of the island while grassland plains and forrest lay to the north eastern edge, making city expansion almost impossible.   <BR>
<BR>
Once having crossed the bridge, one is faced with a choice of two routes:  The northern route, North Bayou Coast Parkway, takes visitors on the scenic route around the unpopulated portion of the isle, it circles around the northern end of the isle and then joins back up Veils Beach Drive at the south/east tip of the island.  The more direct route into Voletta proper is the southern route, Veils Beach Parkway, which leads into the town and to the business and residential districts.  <BR>
<BR>
Veils Beach boarders Voletta to the west and south, while North Avenue is the northern boarder to our little provincial parish.  From one of these two streets you can reach any north/south running street in town.  South Avenue is the connecting street between Veils Beach and North Avenue on the eastern side of the island, this quiet sideroad curves along the Warehouse/Dock area of the city.<BR>
<BR>
Downtown Voletta has several major streets that run west to east, with a delightful assortment of side streets, parks and squares running between them.  Main Street divides the city from west to east, while Billaud Drive separates the north from the south ends of town.  <BR>

<BR>
<B>Entertainment Area:</B>  The entertainment area, including several artist's studios, little stores, and restaurants, is bordered on the North by Billaud Drive and moves south to Veils Beach Drive.  Main Street sits at the western edge while Lavcrone Drive marks the eastern edge.  The only street running north to south in this area between the boarders is LaGrange Street.  Included in this area are the following streets that run west to east:  west Lunar Trail, east Crescent Drive, Court Street and west South Square Circle. <BR>

The only exception to this is the small residential section resting at the northernmost section of the city, the most prominent and wealthy residents reside there in old fashioned antebellum homes in that area.
