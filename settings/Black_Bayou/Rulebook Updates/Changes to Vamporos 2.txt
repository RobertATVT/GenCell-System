</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Want my opinion. Well I didn't ask you. Allright. ::Runs in and whines about something so that it seems apprioate for this thread.:: That done, down to the important thing Giant Mutant Clown form.<BR>
<BR>
	First...It seems rather silly. Most other breeds can -choose- their form in some way. So should vampires, I dont believe it would hurt anyone. A few constants could be the gleaming red eyes and the giant sparkling fangs. That done lets move on.<BR>
<BR>
	The Giant Mutant Clown should have wings...I know one in particular who happens to have them, and I have yet to see any major abuse that would cause me not to like them. It adds flare to the TF and could make it so it is worth buying.<BR>
<BR>
	Finally, the stat changes caused by The Giant Mutant Clown is quite ludicris. I believe that it should be +2 Mind +1 to Body, I personally believe this would make sense. -However- if they are planning on keeping +2 then make it +2 Mind and give the Giant Mutant Clown auto climbing or some other advantage. <BR>
<BR>
	Moral- This is going to be sent to LDRSANTBBMAIL will it be changed, hell if I know. However, I know sending it -in- gives it a chance and whining doesn't... However, you cant stop someone from saying whatever the hell you want thats what TOS and Filtering is for.<BR>
<BR>
	Alternate Moral- When you wake up, hearing a scratching noise coming from your closet and you go to check it out, and you find a giant bunny rabbit with gleaming red eyes feeding off of your little brother. Run....Believe me on this one.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
