Every religion has powerful beings that serve their Deity is all things, most of these are men and women much like ourselves.  Some of these are children of the Gods themselves.  However, a good number of them are called Avatars.  Avatars are physical representations of that deity, clinging to each stricture in all things and living to those standards with every breath.  Avatars aren't physical beings though, they are shards of the deity themselves that are bereft of physical bodies, though at times they can appear as a mortal.  When that shard melds with a mortal host the Avatar is created to do the work of the deity.<BR>
<BR>
Player Avatars are those who have chosen to join themselves with a mortal host in able to carry out their guidance of others closer to home.  In most cases they do not reproduce like humans, however there are a few aspects that will allow it.seeing as the.  Avatars have several responsibilities to complete during their time on the earth; they serve as messengers to communicate the Light's will, guide, provide for physical needs, protect, deliver us from danger, strengthen and encourage, answer prayers, and care for souls at the moment of death.<BR>

When this happens, the Light will send a representative of itself, an Aspect, down from the heavens to merge with the mortal.  The resulting creature is an Avatar of the Light.  The Deity on earth.

This makes them somewhat immortal.  There is only one thing that can truly kill an avatar (see Lore Level 3 below for details).  However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the avatar is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to an avatar, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about avatars.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>  You have watched many Hollywood movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You believe avatars come in many shapes and forms.  You may believe they are symbolic in their presence and my not truly exist in the physical world at all.  If they did appear, you might assume they'd be large man-shaped creatures who can fly using their mighty feathered wings, or carry lighting bolts in their fists.  An avatar is never seen without its golden glow hovering an inch above its head, symbolizing all that is good in its soul.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Symbol:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Faith symbols for use against avatars are nothing more than an inverted or disfigured faith symbol used by followers of the light.  They must be actual objects, not a pattern sewn into clothing, for instance.  The object itself has absolutely no power whatsoever.  It is the faith of the wielder that empowers the object.  Holding the faith symbol aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the symbol and the avatar they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the avatar's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the avatar's roll, they are successful.  The avatar must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the avatar from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the avatar may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the avatar will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the angel is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of a faith symbol will only serve to enrage the avatar, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able, even if it is normally against their nature to do so.  It is not possible for one avatar to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>

Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false.  You know that the destructive nature of fire can burn and seriously injure an avatar.  You have also discovered that avatars are vulnerable to the energies of evil.  Any item imbued with this sinister energy causes serious wounds to an avatar.  When an avatar uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the avatar use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Water:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>Faith water is little more than water empowered with the negative energies of the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the avatar with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of faith water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the avatar are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the avatarl suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The avatar must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the avatar heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

You have finally discovered the truth about avatars.  You also know that the Deities Aspect joins itself with mortal hosts in order to directly effect the physical world.  Having studied avatars for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When an avatar uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying an Avatar by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Avatar, which happens to be Volange.  If you wish to identify the Volange as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at an Avatar, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Avatar transform either to or from Volange.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as an Avatar.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>CWI Dagger: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>A dagger of cold wrought iron is little more than dagger forged from cold rather than heat.  The making of these daggers are too difficult for the average person to make, however they are not rare and can be found in specialty knife shops.  Wrought iron is too soft to be used in combat, however, combat is usually over when the time comes to kill an Avatar.<B>  </B>To kill an Avatar, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the Avatar's natural healing abilities.  Avatars happen to be susceptible to a cold wrought iron dagger that penetrates the brain-stem at the base of their skull.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must place the point of the CWI dagger at the base of the Avatar's skull.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, empowering the CWI dagger.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the CWI dagger must be driven through the Avatars's neck, severing the brain-stem on the round following the roll.  The empowerment does not last any longer than that.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  As the CWI dagger passes through the Avatar's brain-stem, the faith the character used to empower it is released, spreading throughout the Avatar's body.  This causes the body to burn internally and on the following round, the flames will erupt around the body.  Seconds later, nothing will remain of the body as the ashes are extremely thin, disintegrating with any kind of contact.  The aspect of the Avatar is then dispersed, utterly destroyed.  Since an Avatar's body has to be in the negative when they are stabbed, they are obviously considered prone.  No attack roll is necessary.<BR>

angels must follow the Celestial Laws as defined by the Light itself.  An angel is always at the service of the Light, and never themselves.  The primary purpose of all angels is to observe Light's creation.  The goal of angels is to get as many souls into the Light as possible.  All angels shall use any means necessary in order to preserve these souls.  Regardless of the past deeds of another, an angel shall preserve that life when it is endangered, especially those who are filled with sin. Only through life my they repent their sins and have their souls recruited to the Light.  The only exception are those lost souls who have given themselves completely to the evils of the dark and become hosts to demons themselves.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>2)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Angels will perpetuate good while striving to eliminate evil.  When an angel knows that a person needs help, the angel will help.  Angels have an innate desire to perform random acts of kindness.  This perpetuity of good also includes an angel's own will being.  However, an angel will defend themselves from attack in any means the angel deems necessary.  Though the angel will rarely kill anything but a demon, sometimes a firm hand is necessary to help someone, or keep the wayward sheep from doing harm to one another.<BR>

This sometimes means physically, but most success comes with words and deeds.  If an angel witnesses a person committing an act of evil, then that angel will intervene to prevent the act.  When encountering a creature of evil (evil by deed), an angel has to use their experience to decide if the beast must be destroyed, or if it is possible to redeem the individual.  As always, the angel's primary focus is redemption.  There is no question when it comes to demons.  Demons are past redemption and they must be destroyed in whatever means possible.<BR>

Angels have been known to marry each other for convenience - to keep prying eyes and questions down in areas large enough to support multiple angels, but sex is not thought of as angels cannot procreate...and that's the only use of the act - according to the Light.  Angels rarely accumulate money or other worldly items as the simple pleasures of humanity and nature are their joy.  Angels can receive permission from their Archangel to accumulate worldly goods, but such acts are always used as a means to either draw more souls to the light or make it easier to destroy the dark. <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.

<B>Effect/Description:  </B>The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.

While an angel is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>
