(##Beckons Call <Vampiric master>##)<BR>
System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The bond created by the ghouling of a mortal is so intense that whenever they wish, the vampire can impose their will upon the slave.  However the connection swings both ways and their are time when the ghoul must seek out their master. Feeling the need to protect their master the ghoul may hear ill word about their master and immediately want to seek them out to warn them of danger. this also come into affect when the ghoul craving the blood of it's master comes into play. <BR>
<BR>
with an intense need to find their master the ghoul will use the same connection that its master uses to summon it to find the master in seek of the intoxicating and empowering vampires blood. Like the ghoul feels the masters call when summed the master will feel this call and know the ghoul slave is in need to contact them. A call made from any ghoul is identifiable simply by the connection between the vampire and their slave.<BR>
<BR>
Knowing this the vampire may choose not to be bothered in which case it will break the connection with it's ghoul temporarily causing the ghoul to not be able to know the location of their master. this can be done by a roll 2d6+Will Vs victim's 2d6+Will. If the vampire succeeds in breaking the connection it will remain broken for a full hour and in this time the ghouls attempts to beckon call it's master will automatically fail. However the ghoul also cannot be summed viae the summons mastery within this hour as the Vampire master has succeeded in severing their connection with the ghoul.</FONT></HTML>
