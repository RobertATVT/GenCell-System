	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">When a character dies, it is never a fun thing.  Months, sometimes even years of work are lost.  Death is cruel and unfair, but death waits for no man.  However, if anything is true about the supernatural, it is that death is not an end--but a beginning.  No religion in history has failed to include an explanation for what death is the beginning of.  There is always an afterlife.  For those who have led good lives, there is paradise.  An Elysian field, Heaven, or even a Valhala.  Something far darker often awaits those who've led lives of evil.  Sometimes eternal suffering, and sometimes ultimate death of the soul.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Judgement:  </B>When a character in Black Bayou meets their end, they are sent to the land of the dead.  There are few things that will keep a character from going to the land of the dead.  If the character kills himself, he may not go onto this reward.  If the character was a demon, they are also prevented from recieving this reward.  But in all other cases, the character will be assumed to have led a basically good life, despite evil deeds they may have commited.  However, if the character commits an evil deed (rape, or murder) within a month prior to the character's death, they will not be permitted into paradise.  <BR>

Death is an unfortunate and frightening experience, but couldn't the same be said about life?  Either way, the whole shebang is a difficult thing to go through, and those who get through it well deserve a reward.  So what is this reward like?  Why it's everything you've heard!  The streets are paved with gold, your deceased loved ones are all there.  Everyone has enough to eat, and there is peace and serenity throughout the land.  It has been speculated that the garden of Eden was modeled after the more rural areas of this place, known only as Paradise to its residents.  However, there are urban areas that many souls prefer to visit.  One such area is the central focus of Paradise in Black Bayou.  This place is known as Elysia.  It's also called Paradise City <g>.  <BR>
<BR>
	What is life like in Elysia?  It's much like it is on Earth.  People live in houses, the design of which is subject to their own desires.  Automobiles are unnecessary, and do not exist in Paradise.  Residents of Paradise have much preferable ways of getting around.  Drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol have no purpose in a land of eternal bliss, and therefore do not exist.  Though souls will remember such things from their secular experiences, it is very rare that any resident of Paradise will have the slightest desire for such things.  There is no television, nor radio, but there are records, CDs, etc., and devices to play them on.  Music is a very important part of happiness.  There is no hatred in Elysia, but it is not against the rules to dislike someone.  The Light understands that not all personalities mix well.  There have been times when personalities have clashed so badly that fights have broken out in Elysia.  Fortunately, there is no death in Paradise, and it is very rare that grudges are held.  There are no guns, but old-fashioned weapons such as swords, axes, daggers, etc. can be found in many areas.  Remember that angels live in an area of Paradise, and angels have done battle before, and will do battle again.  <BR>
<BR>
	Spirits may not travel to the earth (with the exception of Haloween), but angels are able to travel between realms between assignments on earth.  Once in a while, an angel will be allowed to split from it's host while the host sleeps, and travel to Paradise for one night.  This occurs when the angel is needed to carry an important message to the earth (i.e. a spirit's ex-wife is depressed and is contemplating suicide, and the spirit wishes to tell her that he is okay and wants her to move on with her life).  An approved SL is needed for an angel to be allowed to travel between realms.<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, some souls are different from others.  Sometimes souls have been known to be agressive lovers of havoc and combat, but still be essentially good people.  These people will most likely be allowed into Paradise, but there is a special place where they may go, upon occasion, to satisfy their appetite for destruction.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">	Odin's romper room, Valhalla is a special place in Paradise where the artists of war and lovers of combat visit from time to time.  In Valhalla, souls engage in combat with one another.  Though pain does not exist in the rest of Paradise, it is very real in Valhalla.  However, like with any other area of Paradise, a soul can not be permenantly destroyed.  Death in Valhalla will result in the character merely being down until dinner time, when the combatants all settle down to a glorious feast.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Admission to Valhalla:  </B>In order to be admitted into Valhalla, a soul must appeal to the Valkyries.  These mythical maidens are the guardians of Valhalla.  Anyone who has died in combat will be allowed into Valhalla.  Other than that, all that is required is a body statistic of 8 or higher, and a deep love for the art of war <g>.  <BR>
<BR>
	Valhalla is not open all the time.  ((NOTE TO PARADOX:  An appropriate time for Valhalla to be open...Im thinking, perhaps, the last Friday of every month, for a few hours, should be inserted here.  There should also be a limit on how many people can be allowed into one session, and it should be stipulated that no one may do it twice consecutively unless there is spare room.))<BR>

</I>A spirit is a deceased human being who has gone to Paradise, the brighter side of the afterlife.  They are, to each other, physical beings.  They appear just as they did in life, whether they were beautiful or not, because beauty is purely internal in Paradise.  They are beings who know no hate.  Even if they were murdered, their murderer is not subject of their hatred.  Spirits cherish the events from their lives, but even a murderer is not hated, as that person was the one who brought about the spirit's birth into eternal bliss.  <BR>
<BR>
Spirits know no pain, though pain does exist in certain areas of Paradise (namely Valhalla).  They have some human desires, such as the desire for love, companionship, and yes, sex <g>.  Drugs, alcohol, and other such things to not exist in Paradise, and rarely will the spirits desire such things.  They relish in the freedom from their mortal lives, though it is common for them to miss such things as loved ones.  Of course, spirits have been known to visit the physical world for such purposes . . . <BR>

This is quite obvious, as the only possible way to become a spirit is by dying.  When a character dies, they are allowed into Paradise provided they have followed the following rules:<BR>
<BR>
1) Their death was not the result of suicide.<BR>
2) The character did not commit rape or murder (this includes vampires killing prey                           	within a month prior to its death.  <BR>
3) The character was not a demon</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.<BR>
<BR>
If the above rules have been followed, then the character will be admitted to Paradise.  <BR>

On these visits they will not do such things as attempt to haunt those who were disliked in life, nor will they seek out loved ones to reveal who was responsible for their death (if one such party can be pin-pointed).  The visit is merely for purposes of showing their loved ones that they are okay, and reminding them that they love them.  Spirits will appear to the living as they looked in their life, with the exception of a glowing quality, and their tendency to float.  When visiting the earth, Spirits can not affect the physical world.<BR>

All stats, modifiers, and skills remain unchanged.  Though firearms do not exist in Paradise, XP spent on the firearms skill can not be traded for other skills.  There may not be guns to use, but the spirits still know how to use them!  XP are earned as they are in life, and can be used to update the CS as normal.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In Paradise, spirits often find that they have the ability to do things that they wouldn't have been able to do.  This is just one example of the many small blessings the Light gives to his children in Paradise as reward for thier good deeds in life.  By achieving a TN of 18, the spirit may ignore TNs for the skill denoted in the mastery's activation.  (Example:  A spirit beats the TN using the music skill.  For the entire night they may use the music skill without rolling, having an assumed auto-success every time.)  This ability may be used with the following skills:  <I>Writing, Theology, Special Effects, Music, Acting, and Politices (remember Lucifcer?<g>).</I></HTML>
