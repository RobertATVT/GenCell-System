</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>I don't necessarily expect to see this in the next rule's update, but I was bored and thought this up and thought I should at least send it in.  If nothing more it could inspire some other nifty vampire Mastery or possibly even be used as an Elder Mastery.  Anyhoo- here it is.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><I><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  2d6 + Mind vs. 2d6 + Mind; Five days<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>Vampires- whether they adopt the facade of stoic murderer or seductive ingenue- are creatures of dark, driving passions.  The lust for blood is a powerful physical and psychological drive within the vampire.  If blood is not consumed every night madness begins to creep into the vampire's mind, tearing at reason and utterly destroying the vampire's mind as long as the thirst goes unabated.  And though this thirst is fearsome, some vampires grow to understand it and control it to a small extent.  By making eye contact with another person and speaking to him or her, the vampire can transplant a fraction of that creeping madness into the other person's mind, driving him to acts he normally would not consider. The need to accomplish the action issued by the vampire becomes as powerful within the mortal as the thirst for blood becomes within a vampire and the consequences become the same.  The longer the character goes without completing the task the further into madness they slip.  This degeneration of reason begins after the first day. It is a slow, painful process and the effect builds until the fifth day when completing the task becomes maddeningly important.  Characters are at -3 for actions speciffically against the implanted action (such as trying to heal the person a vampire has asked the character to murder) for the first four nights and at -5 on the fifth night for any action other than the one implanted by the vampire.  Should the victim survive the fifth night without completing the task, then the madness disipates and they are left with questions of why they felt such compulsions in the first place (unless they know the vampire's breed and succeed on the Lore roll).  Though this power is strong, the vampire must overcome the character's ethics and personality in order to force the character into action, as reflected by the following scale:<BR>
	<B>If the roll is won by ..        				Effect</B><BR>
	1-3 points    		The victim can be forced to do acts slightly against his 						character (i.e.- not satisfying a vice; picking up a new vice)<BR>
    	4-7 points       		The victim can be forced to do acts he thinks to be 						wrong. (i.e.-adultery; robbery)<BR>
    	8-10 points       		The victim can be obsessed with the most heinous acts. 						(i.e.- murder, other vile actions)</HTML>
