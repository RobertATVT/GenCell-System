</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></B>Non-Combat Skills:<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Your first attempt at any Non-Combat Skill roll is made normally.  If you roll again inside of an hour for the same thing, your roll will be at -1.  Roll again?  -2.  And so on and so on until that hour is up when the Skill roll will once again be made normally.  Remember that after the first attempt and the negative modifiers are added, automatic success with double sixes is no longer applicable until the hour is up and the Skill roll is once again made normally.  The only exception is the Luck Skill.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- Hosts have been telling players that no roll is allowed more then three chances.  Can we see this written in the rulebook?<BR>
<BR>
ACTING:<BR>
- Complete Mimicry.  There should be limitations set.  For example, it would be difficult for Bear to mimic Syn. But should he succeed the TN - this would be possible.  Perhaps tack something in there like "at the GM, ST or HOSTs discretion".<BR>
- Idea.  Perhaps there should be a bonus allowed to the Music skill if Acting is present on the characters sheet.  Some performers who do not sing as well as others, make up for this by putting on a great show. Maybe work it like Finance does with Income rolls?<BR>
<BR>
ATHLETICS:<BR>
- TN's by HOSTs tend to range from simple, to impossible to beat.  Is there a chart they go by that could be posted here?  If not, instead of considering actions, maybe a chart composed of feet could be made?  Example: Distance of 3 feet - TN:6.<BR>
<BR>
BARTENDING:<BR>
- I never have liked the roll for confiding. It's lopsided, and not worth even buying the skill.  It should be 2d6+mind+bartending vs 2d6+mind+steel will. OR 2d6+mind+soul (since it does take a LITTLE compassion to get someone to talk) vs 2d6+will. If the roll isn't changed, this line "Bartenders are also known for their sympathetic ear and find it easy to get others to confide in them.  Bartenders are excellent at collecting information." should be taken out of the skill description.<BR>
<BR>
BASIC MEDICAL:<BR>
- First, can this skill be made to be used on animals? I.E. Vetrinarian's?<BR>
- Could there be a bonus if Major Medical level 5 or above is possessed?<BR>
<BR>
BREED LORE:<BR>
- This is a sore spot for me.  I think for each level of breed lore purchased, a link should be included to a post (long or short, thread or not), or a log sent with, in which the CS has learned that lore.  If not this, at least SOMETHING showing role-play which would earn this lore.<BR>
- This line, "If your character does not possess the Breed Lore, then they do not know anything about the existence of the breed." is stupid.  There are movies, and books and all sorts of horror/sci-fi things out there.  Maybe try wording it "If your character does not possess the Breed Lore, then they do not BELIEVE anything about the existence of the breed."<BR>
<BR>
FAITH:<BR>
- Same thing as I said before for the lore.  I listened to one player boast about how he gained 11 levels of Faith in a single update.  All I had to say was "what the hell?".  How does a person, in one month, latch onto faith just like that.  I have some idea's here, but I don't like them much.  I'd like to see what other people have to say.<BR>
<BR>
MAJOR MEDICAL<BR>
- The only change I'd like to see here is that, unless it's emergency, this skill can't be used outside the hospital.<BR>
<BR>
SPECIAL EFFECTS<BR>
- Same point with the mimic here.  I don't care iff you achieve a perfect 30 with this and acting. The person you mimic has to be around the same build.  Maybe put something like "At HOST, ST or GM discretion."<BR>

-Capoeira : Maybe this is just me.  But this is a 'fast paced dance so they won't get caught fighting.'  Instead of giving this the bonus of +1 Dodge, and +2 Initiative, maybe it should be +2 Dodge, and +1 Attack.  Get the damage in, get out of the way, and get away from the scene as quickly as possible.<BR>
<BR>
- Direction : The demons and angels are off balanced. And this is part of the reason. Demons receive +2 Will with their fighting style.  Angels are mentally just as sound.  They have great peace of mind, and extreme faith.  I suggest instead of having +2 Initiave and +3 Dodge, to making it +2 Will, +3 Dodge OR +2 Will +1 Initiative +2 Dodge.<BR>
