</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>I have some ideas for some plain ole RP masteries.  Now, please, don't turn these down because it seems that not a lot of people would want to buy them.  That doesn't matter.  Just because a lot of people don't want them doesn't mean that the people that do want them should have to suffer.  One thing I hate about players in this game is that they will rag on RP masteries with no real reason.  For instance, one suggested mastery here is Levitation for vampires.  People say vampires wouldn't NEED Levitation since they can fly as a bat.  Hell, they don't NEED Obsession when they've got Hypno.  Wolves don't NEED Rending when they have Hunter's hands.  But people should have the choice to get these masteries if they want.  It's not like anyone's losing anything by such a mastery being passed.  It's not like anyone loses money, or these unnecesary masteries will kill their families or something.  <BR>
<BR>
Id like to take a moment to commend a few masteries:<BR>
<B><I>Mortal:</B>  Haidee<BR>
<B>Psychic: </B> Isolation<BR>
<B>Lamia: </B> Flight, Hat Trick, Shroud Of Silence<BR>
<B>Vampire: </B> Summons, Obsession<BR>
<B>Werewolves: </B>Goad, Homestead, Friendship, Enhanced Senses</I><BR>
<BR>
And most of the angel and demon masteries.  But here, I'm going to submit a few ideas for RP masteries for different breeds.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I><BR>
<BR>
Vampires~<BR>
Levitation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> <B>- 1 Soul to use. (##Levitation##)</B><BR>
<B>Generation Cost:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></B> 5 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>/<B> Experience Cost:</B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12>25</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; this mastery takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Being unnatural creatures, the laws of the natural rules to not always apply to the vampires.  The vampire can use its preturnatural magic to defy the forces of gravity and take to the air.  They can fly up to 1000 feet, at no faster than 25 miles per hour (top speed takes several minutes to reach) and can carry no more than 10 pounds with them.  This can not help them to escape combat any quicker, as when flight begins, it is a slow take off.  Top speed of 25 MPH takes several minutes to reach, so no quickness bonus can be recieved for using this mastery in combat.  The intoxicating feeling of flight is such that the vampire will be in a happy, sometimes spiritual mood for a while after flight.  They will not be easily provoked to fight, but a situation involving self defense or defense of a friend or loved one will quickly drag them down from their high.  <BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>Psychics~<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>(This first one is slightly modified from it's original version written by <A HREF="aol://3548:SeumusMacIomhair">SeumusMacIomhair</A>)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11>Time Bond </I>- </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>1 Soul to Use  (##Time Bond##)<BR>
Generation Cost: </B>10 <B> Experience Cost: </B>50<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 25~if victim is willing<BR>
					roll 2d6+Will vs. roll 2d6+ Will~if victim is unwilling<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> (Requires Touch Time)<BR>
When a psychic reads someone's future there is sometimes a "residual" effect that allows psychics to "Bond" mentally with that person.  This bond is stronge and can even cross plains of existence.  The Bond however isn't permemnant and will fade after 3 days, however during those 3 days the bond is incredibly strong and the Psychic will feel all emotions of the person he is bonded to.  If either person is injured the other will feel that damage, and take -1 mind.  The Bond will also allow the Psychic to "feel" where the other person is and if that person is in trouble Psychics have been known to cross the very gates of hell to protect that person.  If the person is involved in combat, the Psychic will jump in and protect that person at all costs, even it means giving up their own life.  The time it takes for the psychic to arrive on scene is at the ST's discrection.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Empathic Channeling  <I> Costs 1 Soul per use.   (##Channeling##)<BR>
Generation:  10		Experience:	50</B></I><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6 + Will vs. roll 2d6 + Will~if victim is unwilling<BR>
				     roll 2d6 + Will vs. TN 22~if victim is willing<BR>
     		Will last 1 round for each point over the victim's roll, or until the victim sleeps<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The psychic can use their empathic powers for things other than sensing the emotions of another.  A psychic can become a channel for emotion in order to effect the emotions of another.  For example, a psychic could find a happy person and bring a depressed friend to that person.  By placing a hand on both people, the psychic can channel the happiness of the intial person into the depressed person, making them feel better.  If the psychic himself were feeling happy, he could channel his own happiness into his friend.  This power can also be used in self-defense.  If someone was in a homocidal rage, with their mind set on destroying the psychic, the psychic could use this power to channel the happiness of another into the angry party, taking away the desire to kill.  He could even channel his own fear into the angry party, not taking away the desire to kill, but rendering him incapable of it, and giving the psychic an opportunity to escape.  The roll is only neccesary if the victim is unwilling, and after the duration, the victim will return to his previous state of mind.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>Mortals~<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>The long sought after 4th mortal inate:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Intuition  <I> Costs 0 Soul per use.   (#Intuition#)</B></I><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The mortal is the only natural being in the bayou.  In a world full of vampires, werewolves, and the like, the mortal has learned to understand the feelings such beings give them, despite lack of factual knowledge of the lore of a creature.  They get a feeling--a hunch, so to speak--that there is something not quite right about the person they are talking to.  Once a night the mortal may make a mind roll against 14 to pick up on such feelings.  This mastery can not be used to determine a character's breed.  It can only to sepperate the natural and unnatural.  Lamia and Psychics are both considered natural beings; Vampires, Werewolves, Angels, Demons, and Ghouls are considered unnatural. <BR>
