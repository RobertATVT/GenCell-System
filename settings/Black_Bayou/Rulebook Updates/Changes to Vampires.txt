This is probably where the rumors about rampaging vampires roaming the countryside come from.  Once the vampire is again able to drink blood, the effects of the insanity will wear off.

Vampires must drink approximately half of the blood in an average sized human to be satisfied. They can either pierce the artery with the fangs they are able to retract at will, located just behind the normal incisors or they can simply cut the victim.  Of course, the bite marks will have to heal normally and will be an obvious wound for a few days, causing 1 point of Body damage to the victim.  Many modern vampires have taken to simply cutting the vessel to cover their supernatural tracks.<BR>
<BR>
Since only half of the blood is necessary, the vampire need not kill its vessel.  However, the ecstatic effect blood had on them makes it very difficult to stop drinking and occasionally results in the death of the host.  This phenomenon is called the Blood Rush.  A vampire that drinks from a vessel must roll 2d6+Will vs a TN of 20.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>((</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>This part will be removed </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- Vampires who have had their breed change approved for more than three months no longer have to make this roll, even if they are trying to create offspring.))</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  If they succeed, they are able to control themselves and can kill or not kill the victim as they wish.

If they drink half of the victim's blood, they are sustained for two days instead of one. These energies, however, are both positive and negative, and do affect the vampire's mind. These effects are best described as hallucinogenic, and vary greatly from vampire to vampire. The only thing that can be said for all vampires is the hallucinations are <I>extremely</I> potent. While under the effects of this potent blood, more than one vampire has been thought to have seen the Light itself, sitting in the sun, as the deadly rays' burn through their form.

<B>Effect/Description: </B> Over time, the vampire can learn to expand and direct the nature of its inner beast during times of stress.  This monstrous energy can then be directed toward the vampire's physical form, causing the beast form of a vampire to emerge.  In vamporos form the vampire's body expands beyond the bounds of its human shape.  The vampire becomes massive, standing nearly eight feet tall.  Its body is skeletal, any clothes the vampire wore would be ripped and hanging loosely from its body.  The face elongates sharply from forehead to chin and cheek to cheek.  The vampire's eyes shrink to mere slits, the pupils glowing an eerie red.  Wicked gleaming fangs hang below the bottom lip and the nails harden into sharp claws.  The vampire's mind explodes with anger and passion, almost completely overriding rational thought.  It can formulate simple thoughts and speak crude, guttural English (or other language depending on its homeland).  Vampires can feed normally in this form.  While in this form, the vampire gains +2 Body and </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>+1 Soul</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>. <BR>

While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  During a shift into wolf form, a vampire may alter its molecular structure, assuming an oily mist form, slightly yellow in color.  It seems to float just above the ground, like a light fog.  While in this form, a vampire is immune to any physical damage except for that of the sun, fire or electricity (treat as fire).  If it takes  3 points of damage or more in one round, the shock will shift it back to its mortal form.  The vampire cannot make any physical attacks.  Mist can be trapped in an airtight container (the size of a large tea pitcher or larger) by a prepared victim.  The vampire may mindspeak in mist form, however, no other masteries may be used.  While in this form it may still be seen and smelled.  The mist vampire moves rather slowly and incurs a -4 penalty to quickness.  The vampire cannot feed in this form.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>     Vampires, as with most cold blooded creatures, may go long periods of time between feedings. To sustain it's life, a vampire must consume the amount of blood in an entire human body each month. Whether this is done in a single feeding (killing the victim) or in two smaller feedings is up to the vampire (and their blood rush rolls). It is Mandatory that the vampire feed on a PC character. Each feeding must be witnessed by the Room Host, or an ST (assuming the feeding happens during or immediately following an ST'd event <players may not request ST's to witness feedings if nothing else is going on>).<BR>

Tracking Feedings:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
     Each feeding should be posted in the ST's lair. If the Vampire wishes to also post in another folder to gain XP for the post, they may do so, but only 1 additional folder is allowed.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Delayed CS Updates:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> If the vampire goes 6 weeks (a month and a half) <42 days, specifically> without updating their CS, they must include links to account for double the normal requirements. They must account for the feedings of both months, and not just for one CS update.<BR>
<B>     <U>Example Month 5:</B></U> <BR>
<B>1. </B>Our buddy Kirk still has the following stats (Body 9 - Mind 10 - Soul 3)<BR>
<B>2. </B>Kirk goes decides he's going to be slick and goes 2 months before he updates his CS even though he only drank 1 full body of blood.<BR>
<B>3. </B>On his CS Kirk reports 2 feeding posts (he managed to drain only 1 full body of blood in the 2 months since his last update).<BR>
<B>4. </B>Once Kirk's update is complete, the CS department will see that Kirk isn't quite as smart as he thinks he is (because he didn't read this example which was specifically written about him) and will penalize him for drinking *only* 1 full body of blood in 2 months<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><B>6. </B>The CS department then deducts 50% from Kirk's normal stat levels (50% Body = 9 x .50 = 4.5 (rounded up to 5)) (50% Mind = 10 x .50 = 5) (50% Soul = 3 x .50 = 1.5 (rounded up to 2)).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>No Feed Stockpiling:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Players must make new feedings for each month. If a player feeds 5 full bodies in one month they are not allowed to stockpile those for later months. Once the month is done with, all feedings reported in that month are over and new feedings must occur, regardless of how many feedings were reported in the past.<B><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12>Victims Fighting Back:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>If the victim decides it is going to fight back, the vampire can either choose to abandon the feeding and flee the scene, or fight it out with the victim and feed on them when they are unconscious. The victim is allowed to begin to "officially" fight back whenever they like, but for the sake of mind-altering commands (such as hypno or even fasttalk) the victim will automatically have a chance to fight back the moment the vampire begins to feed (and before the vampire does any Body damage). For instance, Kirk gets off his lazy butt and decides to feed. Kirk bites Bill. The moment Kirk bites Bill, Bill is given the option of fighting back. At this point, Bill has received 0 (no) Body damage. If Bill decides to Fight back, an ST must be called and they must go to a PR to have a full fight scene (which may result in someone dying).<BR>

Damage to Victims (half feeding):</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>If the victim chooses not to fight back (or has been beaten to a pulp), the loss of half the blood in the victims Body automatically drops them to 1 Body (regardless of what their normal Body level is). A "half" feeding requires 5 minutes of RP or 10 rounds in an STed event. If the Vampire is pulled from the victim at any time during the feeding, the feeding is interrupted and does not count</FONT><FONT  BACK="#ff8000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>***to staff - either the person mysteriously regains all their blood, or you come up with some complex scientific formula on how to determine the percentage of blood loss in direct proportions to the allocated amount of Body to be deducted from the victim's CS***</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  BACK="#FFFFFF" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Anytime during the feeding, the victim may attempt to break the vampires hold.</FONT><FONT  BACK="#ff8000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>***I dunno, grapple rolls sound good***</FONT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ffff00" BACK="#FFFFFF" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><BR>
Damage to Victims (full feeding):</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>If the Vampire fails their bloodrush, or decides to completely drain the victim anyway, the victim will be at (-Body) when the feeding is over. If they were mortal, this means they will be dead. If they were an immortal breed who can only be killed by a faith roll, this means they can now be killed by a faith roll, or have a lot of healing to do. The "full" feeding effects may not begin until after the "half" feeding is complete (i.e. the vampire must have successfully fed for 5 minutes or 10 rounds before they can even begin the Full feeding process). The Full feeding process requires an addition 5 minutes, or 10 rounds. During this time the victim can attempt to break free (with their 1 Body stat) or someone else can pull the vampire off the victim. If this does not occur, then the dead thingie above happens.<BR>

BloodRush During Full Feedings:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Once the vampire has passed the Half feeding mark and has begun the Full feeding, they are allowed to try to beat their BloodRush roll at the very end of their Full feeding, in the hopes of preserving the victims life.<BR>
     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>Initial BloodRush:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Their first roll is made after the vampire has completed their Half Feeding time. This is the standard 2D6+Will vs TN 20.<BR>
     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>Secondary BloodRush:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Their second attempt can be made near the very end of the feeding, just before the victim dies. This roll is made at 2D6+Will vs TN 26. If they fail this roll, the victim dies (drops down to their -Body regardless of where they were at when the feeding began). If the vampire succeeds in this roll, they have stopped themselves before draining the victim completely. The Victim will be at -1 Body (unconscious) and the vampire will only be able to claim this as half a feeding because they didn't complete the full feeding and only completed half the feeding.<BR>
