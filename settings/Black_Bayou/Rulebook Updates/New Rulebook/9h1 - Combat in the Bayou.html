</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>While combat is not the primary focus of Black Bayou, it is always a possibility with so many different types of people inhabiting the same area.  Compound this with a mix of supernatural creatures, and conflict is bound to arise at some point.  When talking or trickery will not solve the problem, combat occurs.<BR>
<BR>
The following rules are presented in order to make confrontational situations as easy to handle as possible.  A Storyteller (ST) will be required if you want the combat to be judged fairly.  A Storyteller is a referee who has been fully trained in using the following rules.  This training includes concepts such as scenery effects, special maneuvers and full knowledge of skills and masteries.  In order to contact an ST, simply ask the Room Host that is on duty in the main play room.  He or she will then locate a Storyteller for you and your group, if one is currently on-line.  <BR>
<BR>
As STs are only human, sometimes a player will disagree with the Storyteller.  When this occurs, the player may make an appeal to <A HREF="mailto:LDRS ANT BB Mail? subject=Appeal of ST'd Event">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">within 48 hours of the conclusion of the scene.  The ST Advisor will overseer this appeal and respond as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Should you still dispute the call of the ST Advisor, the Forum Director can be appealed to.  This is the -final- step in the appeals process.  If the Forum Director once more upholds the ST Advisor's decision, it is ironclad.  <BR>
<BR>
f a dispute arises that escalates to a point where an ST is needed, and no Storyteller is available to watch over the fight, the players have a few options available to them.  First, the players may simply walk away from the encounter and go about their lives as if no conflict had occurred.  Alternatively, they can opt to "freeze" their characters voluntarily until an ST becomes available.  If this happens during normal gaming times, a Room Host needs to be contacted so that the arrangements can be made.  If this "freezing" takes place outside of normal gaming hours, one person needs to write an email stating the situation, and list all involved. This mail is to be sent to <A HREF="mailto: LDRS ANT BB Mail?subject= Frozen Scene">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">,</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> and the ST Advisor will contact all players involved to come up with a time and date when everyone can get together to play out the conflict.  The final option, if no Storyteller is present and all sides wish to proceed, is to run the fight yourselves.  There are numerous inherent dangers to this option.  Lack of rules knowledge, the possibility of improper gameplay and the inability to appeal the outcome of the fight are just a few examples.  Remember, if no ST is onhand to preside over the combat, no character may die in -any- conflict.  <BR>

In a confrontation, time is of the essence.  To try to simulate the intensity of combat, encounters are divided into three time segments:  Scene, Round and Turn.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Scenes:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> </B></I>The scene is described as the entire encounter, whether it be combat or role-play.  The scene often changes with the scenery and the situation.  For easy reference, you can assume the following:  Anytime you go from one location (D*=Docks, to S*=The HMS Spliff) to another, the scene has changed.  When 1 hour of in character Roleplaying has been done (Not ST'd events), or an ST'd event ends, so does the scene.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Rounds:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> All confrontations are divided into rounds.  A round represents the amount of time it takes for all those involved to take an action.  Once each character involved has taken their action, and all non-player characters have acted, then the current round ends and the next round can begin (if more rounds are needed).  For simplicity's sake, a round is defined as a thirty-second time span.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Turns:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> The turn is the duration of time it takes an individual character to take their action.  There are as many turns as there are characters, and non-player characters, involved in the scene.  Almost any action may be attempted during a turn, provided those actions would not take longer than 3-6 seconds.  If a character attempts to do something that would take longer than the allotted time, the character has two choices.  Either choose a new course of action, or extend the action into his next turn to complete their plan.<BR>
<BR>
Most masteries have a time limit required for activation.  The mastery will take effect the round after the activation time listed, unless it is listed as instant.  For instance, if a mastery takes 1 round to activate, the character will begin the mastery on the first round.  On the following round, the mastery will take effect at the beginning of that character's action, not the beginning of the round.  If a mastery requires 2 rounds to activate, the -only- action that character may take is activating that mastery, and nothing else (this does not include dodging attacks).  Additionally, some masteries have a duration that is limited by one of the three time frames listed above.  If a character began a mastery prior to entering the confrontational situation, the mastery's effects will only last for half it's normal duration.  Also, masteries that were active prior to a shapechange are no longer active once the change is complete.  Distance plays an important part of combat as well.  Certain actions and masteries are limited by how far away one combatant is from another.  It is up to the Storyteller (with some player input, if needed) to determine where objects are located and the approximate distances between them.  Accuracy is not as important as imagination, however, certain guidelines should be followed.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Hand-to-hand:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> When a character attacks another without the use of weapons, the attack is considered to be a hand-to-hand attack.  This would include a number of techniques, such as:  fists, feet, claws and fangs.  This category also includes masteries that require touch to affect the victim.  The range of such attacks are very limited since the character must be within arm's, or leg's, length of the intended victim.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Melee:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> Melee combat represents combat where the attacker is using a hand held weapon with similar range limitations of hand-to-hand (knives, chains or a baseball bats, for examples).  In order to engage in melee combat, the attacker must be within ten feet of the intended target.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Line of Sight:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> If a character uses any type of firearm or similar form of missile weapon, they must be within line of sight.  In other words, the intended victim must be somewhere that the attacker can see them.  The ST will have the final say over the actual distance that a ranged weapon can fire, keeping some sense of reality to the situation.  Certain masteries that require line of sight work differently than using weapons.  Unlike using a zeroed in firearm to blast your opponent from far away, masteries are much more intimate attacks.  Therefore, masteries requiring line of sight must be used with the unaided naked eye.  Of course corrective lenses do not effect line of sight in either case.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B>Scenery</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B><BR>
The scenery represents the world around the combatants.  Whether it be a room, a car chase or a battle in the woods, the scenery often times will affect the actions the characters will or can take.  The character's surroundings can alter the chances of succeeding when an action is attempted.  Although these instances are virtually limitless, we have attempted to take the most obvious ones into account.  It is the Storyteller's responsibility to take the following situations into account when a character attempts an action under these circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Vision:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> In order to physically affect a target, the character must be able to see it, or sense it by some other means.  Vision is the only sense that will be covered here as certain masteries make vision penalties and bonuses obsolete.  When vision is obscured, it becomes more difficult to not only hit but to also dodge an opponent.  It is important to remember that Mortals cannot see in the dark so will often fall to the penalties imparted here.  Those breeds who can see in the dark will not be penalized by these vision rules due to darkness, but other weather effects may cause vision problems.  It is also important to remember that lit areas also do not fall into any obscurity rules (Symp parking lot for example).  While it is up to the Storyteller to assign specific bonuses or penalties to actions due to current vision limitations, the following list of examples are a guide that should be followed:<BR>
<BR>

This can be accomplished numerous ways:  Hiding behind a car, ducking to the ground, using another character as a human shield, etc.  Again, it is up to the ST to hand out specific bonuses or penalties to actions against a target that has cover.  These cover bonuses are only applicable when the defender is being fired upon by a line of sight weapon (i.e., masteries do not count).  Below is a list of examples that should be followed:<BR>

This phase determines the order in which all combatants take their actions.  This is the one roll that can never be failed or won. Initiative is a place marker that the Storyteller uses to determine who acts when.  The character with the highest score goes first, while those with the lowest go last.  It is the job of both the Storyteller and the players to keep track of lost Statistics when calculating their Initiative.  Lost Body and spent Soul are to be subtracted from your Quickness modifier, should these Statistics have changed during the course of the previous Turn.<BR>

After initiative has been rolled and the order of action has been determined, the first player gets to take an action.  Usually, this is to attack.  However, any action that would require 3-6 seconds or less may be attempted, at the Storyteller's discretion.  No dice rolls are needed unless there is a chance that their proposed action could possibly fail.  Should the ST feel that the action might fail, it is their job to set forth the requirements for success (i.e., the roll that will be used by the character).  For instance, opening a door would not require a dice roll and could take place during one turn.  Alternatively, leaping over a car to grab for a weapon might require a Body+Athletics roll to see if the character was able to make the jump and land with some semblance of grace.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Attack:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> The first thing to do when attacking is to figure out the attacker's total attack modifier.  This number is figured out by adding the skill level being used (if any) to the attacker's base attack modifier.  Then, a die roll is made, adding the total attack modifier to the result of that roll.  If the opponent does not, or cannot, dodge, the attack is then successful.  If the defender chooses to dodge the attack, see "Defense" below.  The attacker must have a higher number total than his/her target in order to hit their target.  If a tie ever occurs between attacked and defender, the defender is always successful.<BR>

This can be anything from a simple sidestep, dropping to the ground, ducking or leaping out of range.  The defender must figure out what their character's defense modifier is.  To do this, the player adds the character's Quickness modifier and evasion skill (if applicable) together.  This total represents the defense modifier for that character.  Then, the players rolls dice and adds their defense modifier to the result of that roll.  The defense score in then compared to the attacker's total.  If the defender's score is higher, or in the event of a tie, the attack has been avoided.<BR>
<B>System:</B> roll 2d6 + Quickness Modifier + Evasion Skill Level<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Defending Multiple Attacks:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> Occasionally a character may be engaged in combat with more than one opponent.  When the character attempts to dodge the attacks on multiple opponents, the character suffers a -2 to any dodge roll after the first.  This -2 penalty is cumulative with every attacker.  For instance, if a character is defending against three attackers, the first defense roll is made normally.  The second dodge would suffer a -2 penalty.  The third attempt at avoiding an attack would be at -4.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Defensive Stance:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> A character who has gained initiative over their opponent(s) for that round may choose to take a defensive stance as their action.  This means that the character may not attack, move or activate a mastery for the remainder of the round.  The character then receives a +4 bonus to all defensive actions for the duration of the round.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Damage:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I> The damage caused by an attack is simply the base damage of the weapon the character attacks with.  A Glock 9 mm would do 3 Body points of damage as it falls under the category of small arms.  A knife would do 1 Body damage because it is a small melee weapon.  A Ninjitsu Throat Stab would do 2 points of Body damage due to the fact that it is a trained fighting style.  This physical damage reduces the Current Body statistic of the victim.  Once a character has been reduced to 0 Current Body, they will fall to the ground unconscious.  Further attacks upon that character can reduce the Current Body statistic below 0.  If a character's Current Body ever falls to their Base Body statistic in the negative, and they are a Mortal based breed, they will die.  If the character is a breed that requires Lore and Faith to be killed (any Non-Mortal breed), then the character will die if a successful Faith roll is made (see the Faith skill and the appropriate breed for details).  If the appropriate Lore and Faith are not used, the character will simply be unconscious, regardless of the amount of damage they have taken.  This damage will all heal overnight according to the healing powers of the breed.  For instance, if a character's Base Body is 8, they would fall unconscious at 0 Body, and die at -8 Body if they were a Mortal based breed.  If the character was of any Non-Mortal based breed, and the proper Faith roll was used after bringing them to -8 Body, they would be dead as well.<BR>
<BR>
It is also possible to take Mind damage.  There are many ways that a character might suffer mental damage.  Tasers, pepper spray and several masteries are all examples.  Mental damage works the same way as physical damage except the damage is subtracted from the character's Base Mind statistic.  When the character's Mind statistic falls to 0 or below, the character will collapse to the ground unconscious.  Any character that takes mental damage will recover one point of Mind for each half hour of undisturbed rest, up to their Base Mind statistic.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>

An Archery skill of no less than level 8 must be possessed in order to try for a ranged staking.  In addition, the marksman must also aim for a minimum of 1 round before firing.  Once these requirements have been met, the character makes a standard attack roll of 2d6 + Attack + Archery, with a -4 penalty.  The vampire in question then makes a standard dodge roll, (the vampire is not actually "dodging," this is just to accurately gauge the shot and it's aim), of 2d6 + Dodge.  If the shot is successful, the attacker makes a Faith roll as normal.  The vampire that is to be staked in this manner -must- be unconscious and at negative Body statistic prior to the use of Faith.<BR>

The attacking character makes a normal attack roll (2d6 + Attack + Weapon Skill).  Their victim must then roll 2d6 + Quickness Modifier + Weapon Skill.  If the defender wins the roll, he/she maintains possession of their weapon.  Should the attack succeed, the character may either take the weapon from the opponent (if the disarm was attempted by hand) or cause the weapon to fly off in a random direction.  No damage is dealt with this sort of attack.<BR>

The fleeing character may take -no- other action, save for running.  The character may cease fleeing at any given time, should the need arise.  If they manage to dodge every damaging attack that is directed at them for two full rounds, the character has escaped.  Defensive stances may not be attempted, as the character's sole thought is that of escape, not evading incoming attacks.  When the time comes for the character to dodge an attack that has been directed at him/her, they roll 2d6 + Quickness to avoid the attack.  If they receive any damage during the two rounds of fleeing, they must begin anew.  A character that is fleeing, and RPs that they are ducking, dodging, weaving or generally making themselves a more erratic target to hit, will gain a +6 to their defensive rolls.  <BR>

If the character is running, they can move twice their Body Statistic in a round.  Sometimes however that isn't fast enough to get away, if this is the case the character can attempt to "Push it".  Pushing It requires a Body Test vs a TN 20, and if done successfully the character can move at three times their Body Stat for that round.  Failing that roll does nothing to the character, it just does not increase their speed any, however, if the character fails the roll by more than five they managed to pull something and take one point of body damage.  Characters running erratically can run, however they cannot activate masteries nor can they Push It.<BR>

Once the original target has been missed, all others that fall into the area of effect must then roll standard dodge (2d6 + Quickness + Evasion) against the attacker's original roll (minus any aiming and Sure Shot bonuses).  Should all of the characters succeed in dodging, nothing further happens.  Should one or more characters fail to avoid the projectile, the one that failed by the largest amount is struck for half the damage that the weapon normally inflicts (rounded down).  The Storyteller has final say over whether or not a character is in position to be struck by an errant ranged attack.<BR>

The combatants must be within arm's length in order to attempt a grapple roll.  The attacking character then rolls 2d6 + Body + Attack vs target's 2d6 + Body + Quickness to determine if a grab has been made.  If the defender wins the roll, he/she has not been held and is free to go about their action.  Should the attacker be victorious, their opponent is held fast in his/her grasp, and numerous effects occur.  Both characters have a -4 to defensive rolls as they are locked together, making movement difficult.  Neither combatant may attack anyone else, they may -only- inflict damage upon each other.  In order for the character held to break free, he/she must succeed in a Body vs Body roll.  The grappler may release his/her hold at any time.<BR>

However, the difficulty of such a shot increases with where the attacker wishes to strike.  No additional time is required to make a "called shot."

Damage is not the only thing that is affected by a called shot, effectiveness of the attack can also be reduced or increased.  Keep in mind that the torso is the default area for all shots that are not specified.

There are numerous ways to aim, some of which include: Bracing against an object, using two hands on a small caliber firearm or using a tripod for heavy arms.  It takes one complete round to aim, and in doing so the character is granted a +2 bonus to their Attack roll for the next shot that they take.  The character may choose to aim for more than one round, and for each additional round that is taken to aim, another +2 is given to the Attack roll.  The maximum bonus that can be received is +10 to Attack, or 5 rounds of Aiming.  While Aiming, no other actions can be taken, including defensive actions such as dodging.  Furthermore, if the character takes an action, or is damaged physically or mentally, they will immediately lose all Aiming bonuses, and must begin again.<BR>
