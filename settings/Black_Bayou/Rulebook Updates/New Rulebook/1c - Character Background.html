The first thing you need to know about Black Bayou is that this is a role-playing game - meaning you, the player, takes on the role of someone else, your character.  While you are playing Black Bayou, the words and actions you type are no longer about or from you, instead, they are about your character. Every thought and every action you choose to take are those of your character.  Although your character may resemble you in many ways (and in others, they may be totally different personalities) you are still playing the role of a fictional character in the fictional setting of Isle Voletta, Louisiana.<BR>
<BR>
In life, many different circumstances and decisions affect and change us, making us the people we are today.  The same is true of your character.  They will have their own attitude, their own style, their own imagination, even their own lives.  The Background you create for your character will explain why your character became the way they are.  What motivates them?  It would even help determine how they might react to many different situations.  What life experiences have taught them to react their special way with a certain dilemma?<BR>
<BR>
The background may be as simple as a brief history, such as what might be found in a reference book, or as detailed as your own past would be.  Keep in mind, the more time and care you put into your characters past, the more you will understand and care for your character.  After a while, players tend to grow attached to their characters as they watch them take on a life of their own.  A lot of players miss this great opportunity. However, a well thought out background is the first step towards the role-players ultimate goal:  Creation.<BR>

He grew up there living an average life, decent grades, numerous girlfriends, joined the football team in middle school.  Everything seemed to be headed in the right direction.  Then one day the police came to visit him at school.  They told him his parents were murdered execution style - shot in the back of their heads.  Later, it came out in court that his Father was involved in the drug trade, and Mafia hit men had taken out his family.  After living in foster care the remainder of his school years, Jade had gone off to college.  It was then that the hit men who had been looking for him all these years finally found him.  Jade was more resourceful than they had thought, however.  He cleverly trapped them, and called the police.  It was then that Jade decided he would join law enforcement and bring down the Mafia kingpin who had murdered his family. <I> <BR>

Then, when I play him, he has an actual, distinct personality.  If he was to beat the hell out of a drug dealer he happened to see on the street, he would have proper motivation for doing so."  -- Jade Lahnz's Mundane (player)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B><BR>

A few more things about writing a background should be taken into consideration.  In most cases you will begin playing as a mortal.  Ifyou wish to begin the game as anything else, you must first meet certain requirements.  To find out if you qualify, read the Locked category under the Breed's description.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a simple form to give you a hand in creating your background and appearance for your character.  Make sure you include some sort of past for your character, what kind of childhood did they have, where did they grow up, etc.. bring it through to the present and what brought them to Isle Voletta.  Related characters will be limited and if you use the name of a PC then permission of the PC must be gained.<BR>
<BR>
When writing your physical description, please keep in mind that we try and keep characters as normal looking as possible, no red or glowing eyes, etc. Also note that the main room is centered in a nightclub, so your characters ages should reflect that. Characters need to be at least 16 years of age to play, 18 to enter the nightclub (legally), and 21 to drink. The max starting age for a mortal is 50. <BR>
