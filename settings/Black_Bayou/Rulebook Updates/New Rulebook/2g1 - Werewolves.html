When you think of a wolf, what comes to mind?  The nasty beast dressed up like a sweet little grandmother to fool Little Red Riding Hood?  The big bad wolf that blew the Three Little Pigs house down?  In many fairy tales and cartoons wolves are portrayed as sly and sneaky, or just plain mean.  Like most wild animals, though, they seldom seek out confrontations with humans or other wolf packs, unless the latter has crossed into their territory.<BR>
<BR>
Wolves are beautiful, intelligent animals who are loyal to each other. They like company and live in packs - the pack always has a leader, the Alpha, chosen for his strength, wisdom, and cunning.  Wolf families are affectionate and cooperative. They play and hunt together.  They protect each other, too. If one wolf finds itself in some sort of trouble, the others will try to help it. A wolf does live alone, but it is a hard life without the safety of the pack.  Lone wolves often die. <BR>
<BR>
A werewolf is a mortal with a genetic virus. This virus, transmitted by the bite of another werewolf, merges itself with the cells of the mortal. There is no known cure. The werewolf appears to be a normal mortal in all respects. It is now half-man half-beast, however. A monstrous force dwells deep within the werewolf's soul, constantly searching for an opportunity to escape. This, coupled with the raw instinct that occasionally overcomes a werewolf, makes the newly created among them rather dangerous, that is, until they learn to control their newfound animal natures.  <BR>
<BR>

This werewolf must spend 6 hours in a ritual (must be posted) in which they focus on their target. Dancing around a bonfire, occasionally tossing in something personal of the werewolf-to-be. At the conclusion of the ritual, the werewolf goes immediately Horus and then tracks down the target. The tracking is automatic and the Horus will take whatever means necessary to reach the target. Once the hunt has ended, the werewolf will attack the target, attempting to bite them. Unfortunately for most, the Horus is a maddened beast nearly impossible to control. In order for the werewolf to control itself and not kill the target, they must attempt to control the insane beast they have become. To do so, they must successfully roll 2d6+Will vs. TN: 20. If the Werewolf fails this roll, they tear the victim to pieces in a blind rage. Should this roll be successful, as well as a successful attack roll for the bite itself, the green froth around its mouth enters the targets bloodstream? One bite is enough and the Horus will immediately flee, having bitten its target. <BR>
<BR>
	Over the next few days or weeks, the virus will work its way through the target's body. On the night of the next full moon, the target will unexpectedly fly into Horus for the first time and will immediately begin a hunt. The player must then roll 2d6+Will Vs a TN of 24. Success means the werewolf will find the scent of a Mortal (Psychic or Lamia included) and track down their intended target. If the roll is failed, the creature will follow the scents of people, wherever they lead and attack at random. (The host on duty will roll a die to determine the wolf's target.) Its not unheard of for a werewolf to attack a city or town during its first transformation. In fact, that is where some of the rumors about werewolf attacks occurring during the full moon come form. Once it kills its first victim, (for gaming purposes, once it has reduced the CS to 0 Body or below) the newly created werewolf will change back to mortal form, the curse complete (this must be witnessed by a GM or ST and posted). If the werewolf is killed in its attack (Body reduced to negative its Body total as per the Mortal breed) they will die as they haven't completely reverted to werewolf until AFTER successfully accomplishing this attack. If there is some reason that the werewolf-to-be missed the full moon (captured underground, etc) they will turn Horus each evening upon return/release (once they can see the sky again) during the hours of darkness until they either kill a victim or are killed themselves.<BR>

How the plant managed to make its way to the United States is anyone's guess.  The spores of this plant that grow just beneath the petals of the yellowish flowers are believed to have a particularly distasteful odor that can only be noticed by canines.  Whether this is true or not is irrelevant.  It's the faith in the horrible stench of the herb that causes werewolves to be repulsed by it.  Wolfsbane can be found in most herbal shops around the country.  Holding the wolfsbane aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the herb and the werewolf they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the werewolf's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the werewolf's roll, they are successful.  The werewolf must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the werewolf from fleeing until the duration wears off and it even works on a werewolf in Horus form.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the werewolf may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the werewolf will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the werewolf is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of wolfsbane will only serve to enrage the werewolf, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  The werewolf will also change into their Horus form (if not already there) unless they attempt to resist the change with a standard roll.  It is possible for one werewolf to use this warding method on another of its kind, but it requires that the one warding have Steel Will 8 and Faith 8.  NOTE: The target must be able to see the person warding and the wolfsbane for this warding to work.<BR>

You still believe, however, that the werewolves' change into the monstrous form is related only to the full moon. You also realize merely touching silver has no effect on them. Having studied werewolves for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a werewolf uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.

It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  The water must have been used to boil wolfsbane and posted in the ST's Lair message board area each day it is used.  The empowering with faith must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the bane water in whatever item they intend to attack the werewolf with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of bane water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the werewolf are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the werewolf suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The werewolf must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the werewolf heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Werewolf, which happens to be Horus.  If you wish to identify the Werewolf as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Werewolf, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Werewolf transform either to or from Horus.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Werewolf.<BR>

A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the werewolf's natural healing abilities.  Werewolves happen to be susceptible to a silver bullet that penetrates their brain.  The bullet used must be made of silver.  The bullet has to be a solid slug, like that from a handgun.  Unlike a shotgun loaded with silver pellets that spray over an area.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must fire the silver bullet directly into the fallen werewolf's head.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, focusing it on the bullet as it is fired.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for hitting the prone werewolf so long as the range is point blank.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the silver will kill the werewolf instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if it misses (at long range) it will not kill the werewolf.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  The werewolf will appear to be mortal after it has died.<BR>

If at anytime the wolf is cornered by itself and threatened it will panic.  The wolf will suffer a -1 penalty to all combat actions (All Modifiers suffer a -1 for the duration of the confrontation) because they aren't accustomed to being on their own, wolves hunt in packs and panic and strike out when forced into a solitary stance.  Foremost this fear causes a fight or flight response in them.  As soon as the first blow is thrown, the wolf must roll 2d6 + Will vs TN 32.  If they succeed they are fine and resist the urges and can act normally (without the -1 penalty in combat).  If they fail the roll they will immediately change to wolf form and flee the area as quickly as possible.  The wolf will attempt to use any methods possible in order to escape the situation but they will not fight.  If the agressors grapple or trap the wolf, thus providing no means of escape, the wolf will immediately fly into the Horus rage as mentioned below.  If they fail the roll by 5 or more or if they botch (Rolling double ones), the cornered wolf will fly into a Horus rage and begin lashing out at the nearest agressor.

Below is a description of how the phases of the moon affect a Werewolf.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>New Moon</B></U>  - The werewolf if at its most calm and friendly.  Some wolves become blissful or even giddy as this phase comes around.  A werewolf is nearly impossible to anger in this time period and can remain calm under the most stressful situations.  If you have a mastery that assists going in Horus or forces someone to go horus the difficulty is raised by +6 or the defender gets a +6 bonus to resist. (Horus Mastery, Summon the Beast, or Goad)<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Crescent Moon</B></U> - In this phase the Werewolf is generally calm and contemplative.  Any attempts to force Horus get a +3 difficulty (Horus Mastery, Summon the Beast) or a bonus +3 to resist (Goad).  <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Half Moon</B></U> - During the half moon phase Werewolves are just like anyone else.  They are normal everyday people.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Gibbous Moon</B></U> - The Werewolf will begin to get a little more agitated during this time period and prone to being moody and dark.  When the moon is in this phase the werewolf is more susceptable to Horus and so any difficulties to change to Horus are reduced by -3 (Horus Mastery, Summon the Beast) or the defender gets a -3 penalty to resist (Goad).<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Full Moon</B></U> - The Werewolf's attitude has worsened to an extent that they are difficult to be around.  During the full moon all social skills (Fast Talk, Theology, etc...) are reduced to half their levels because of the tense aggravation of the Werewolf.  Any attempts to change to Horus are reduced by -6 (Horus Mastery, Summon the Beast) and any time they are defending against a forced change they suffer a -3 penalty to their roll to resist (Goad).<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Lunar Eclipse</B></U> - The Eclipse is the most dreaded times for wolves.  When a Lunar Eclipse occurs all Werewolves lose their connection to the Wolf inside them.  They lose the ability to use any of their Masteries and cannot shift forms.  The only Masteries that they have acces to during this time is Mindspeak (Not Extended Mindspeak) and Healing.  They still need Level Three Lore to be killed however.<BR>

How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>

While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>
