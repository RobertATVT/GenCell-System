The number of different types of actions that can be attempted are virtually limitless.  Trying to make rules or lists for each and every possible action would be simply impossible.  We have, however, devised a list of several TNs which are requested quite often by the playing mass which are listed below for both the Storytellers and players to use.  If a particular action does not require, or is not affected by any type of random chance, then the action can be assumed to be automatically successful.  As always, the Storyteller determines what action do or do not require a roll.  When a character attempts an action that the ST determines requires a die roll to succeed, the Storyteller will assign a die roll and a Target Number.  If the TN isn't in the charts below, further down is the process used by Storytellers to produce a TN for these situations.  <BR>

<BR>
	This system for breaking objects replaces the previous one to disallow characters from bashing down oak trees without taking as much as a bruise.  Each time the character successfully makes a roll to break something the Body of the object is reduced depending on the damage done by the skill or the strength of the character (If the Character has no Fighting Skill they simply roll 2d6 + Body.  To determine damage for unskilled characters divide the Characters Body Statistic by 4 [round all fractions down]. For every three Body damage done to the object the character breaking it takes one damage, reguardless of Armor or Masteries.  This process continues until the object has no Body levels left and breaks at zero Body.  <BR>
	Multiple characters breaking the same object all take the point of damage done to them by the object.  Characters who fail this roll by five or more lose two points of Body to show that they hit it wrong and have sprained or fractured something.  Simply missing the roll incurs no damage to the character.  Weapons can not be broken in this fashion.<BR>
	The addition of a dead bolt, or similar device, makes the target number slightly more difficult.  A +2 will be added to the Objects Body per deadbolt placed onto it.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
	When a Character is trying to shoot the lock, or use a melee attack to break the item (Firemans Axe/Police Ram), the process works as above however the character doesn't take the above listed damage.  Damage to the objects body is the same as the Weapon (i.e. 3 Body for a pistol, 4 for a sledge hammer).  Certain areas (see also a door with hinges and deadbolts) are more difficult to break down in this fashion.  Each hinge or deadbolt must be targeted (treat as handheld items) and broken in order to get through the door.<BR>
	The only exception to this rule is the use of a Police Ram (Counts as Large Melee).  In this case the person guiding the ram makes the roll and one quarter (round down) of the body of each person assisting is added to the damage to the door.<BR>
	(i.e. The Senior Deputy is leading a drug bust and they are going to break down the door.  He has the assistance of two Deputies on the ram.  Each Deputy has a Body of 8, so quartering this gives him +2 Damage for each one.  The Ram itself (Large Melee) does 4 Body damage, with the assistance of the deputies he gains +4 to the damage.  This totals to 8 Body Damage per hit so a Thin Metal Door could be bashed down with a single hit.)<BR>
<BR>
(Note: The Character breaking the object does not use their Attack Modifier for any roll.)  <BR>

* Most vehicle windows today are designed to not shatter apart when broken.  Rather, they remain intact and allow the object to push through, carrying with it a whole piece of glass that is held together by a clear adhesive.  This adhesive coating prevents major cuts that would be prevalent in plate glass windows breaking.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

All TNs are for distances are listed as horizontal / vertical, these are in the first column.  The TN's and distances for jumping off things/heights is in the second Column. If the character fails a roll to jump up/over something, no damage will be incurred (unless the were leaping over a drop off, like from building top to building top), however, if a character fails the roll to jump down from something or off something they will take damage from the fall. (See section under Climbing for damage from falling).<BR>

 Jumps over 26 feet are not clearable (for mortal based breeds) without the aid of an auto success.  These TNs are for running broad jumps or standing vertical jumps.  If no room to get a small running start is available, increase TN difficulties by +2 for horizontal jumps.<BR>
 Jumping is also possible onto and off of moving vehicles, albeit very dangerous.  Should a character attempt such a feat, a +4 difficulty will be added to the TN.  Bear in mind that environmental conditions may add or decrease from the TNs, based upon the STs or GMs decision.<BR>

<BR>
 If attempting to climb any sort of wall without the proper tools to do so (ropes, hammer, spikes, etc.) a +4 penalty will be added to the final TN.<BR>
 Failure to hit the desired TN does not automatically assume that the character has fallen, merely that he/she cannot move further up or down the surface without another roll.  Should the character fail the roll by more than five, the character has slipped and fallen.<BR>
 Environmental conditions may hinder or aid the character in their climb.  GMs and STs have final say over target numbers.<BR>

	Sometimes that jump wasn't far enough, and sometimes a person will slip and fall off that wall.  Well what happens then?  If a character falls from a climb, or a jump they will suffer damage due to the impact.  If this happens there are two steps, the first is to determine the damage done to them.  This is easy, just look at the chart below.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><U>   Distance Fallen         Damage Taken      </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>

	11-15 feet				2 Body<BR>
	16-20 feet				3 Body<BR>
	21-25 feet				4 Body<BR>
	26-30 feet				5 Body<BR>
	31-35 feet				6 Body<BR>
	for each +5 feet			+1 Body<BR>
<BR>
	The second thing to do is see what part of the body the person landed on, this is done with a roll of 2d6 and consulting the chart below.  For Every 2 Body Damage taken add a +1 to this roll.  (Say they are falling from 27 feet, that would be 5 Body Damage, since all rolls round down this would be a +2 to the 2d6 roll for the location of impact).  Once the location of impact is determined goto the hit location (located under the Combat in the Bayou section of the rulebook) and determine the effects using the appropriate Melee/Firearms location chart depending on the damage. (1-2 Body Damage uses the Throwing/Archery/Fist Loads/Small Melee Chart, 3+ Body damage uses the Small Arms/Heavy Arms/Medium Melee/Large Melee Chart).  Apply the results  (Damage and effects including stunning, and reduced movement) to the character and there you go.<BR>

<BR>
 Keep in mind that even though the character might hit the fuel tank, there no chance that an explosion would ever occur, due to the fact that fuel tank do not keep the contents under pressure.<BR>
 As with firing at a character, a moving target is always more difficult to hit.  Should either the target or attacker be moving, a +4 penalty to the TN will be added.  If -both- attacker and target are in motion, a +8 penalty will be added.<BR>
 Environmental circumstances might add or decrease the TNs.  The Storyteller or Game Master has final say.<BR>

In high speed chases, the person with the highest roll wins the round, 4 rounds of escaping are needed to lose the tail.  <BR>
<BR>

For each block the escaping driver gains on the chasing driver apply a -1 to the chasing drivers roll.<BR>

<B>Generic Target Numbers</B><BR>

 There are some TNs that a Storyteller may have to make which aren't provided above.  Any number of possible TNs may be necessary actually, and under these circumstances the Storyteller will use the following basic guidelines in deciding the proper TN.  When the Storyteller decides the TN for a particular feat, they will use the charts above when deciphering exactly what Easy, Moderate, Difficult and Almost Impossible are.  The Storyteller will next decide which of the two charts to use provided below, then the ST will decide exactly how difficult the action would be based on the circumstances surrounding the character.  This process will conclude with a precise TN produced by the ST in order for the player to attempt whichever feat they requested.<BR>
