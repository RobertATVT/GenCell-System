</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>The Lycanthrope is neither good nor evil as the genetic change to their system doesn't effect their overall psyche.  However, the mighty powers of the genetic change transforms a standard mortal into a hunting machine, one of the most devastating creatures Mother Nature has ever invented.  The genetic change gives the lycanthrope powers unknown by standard man while cursing the lycanthrope at the same time.  To use a mastery, lycanthropes tap into the power of the virus in their blood and use this power to greatly enhance the abilities of their body and mind.  Though a lycanthrope may not be evil, while in Horus they do not have any control over their actions and feel nothing but the blinding rage of the viral curse in full effect.   <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  the roll required to activate the mastery and the target number needed for the character to succeed / how long the effects of the masteries last.  The role-played effects of certain masteries can last a lot longer than the combat effects.  Also listed here is the number of rounds it takes to activate the mastery.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
For most lycanthrope mastery use, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>Range of Effect definitions:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Masteries include four different areas of effect.  These are: Self, Touch, Forced Eye Contact (FEC), and Line of Sight (LOS).  Below are the description of how these work.  Some masteries will not apply to these ranges such as Extended EMS.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Self ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Masteries with a range of Self can only be used on the user, there are no exceptions.  Some examples of this are the various shapechanging masteries the breeds have (Minor Cat Form, Bat Form, Horus Form, etc...)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Touch ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Masteries with a range of touch require you to touch the person through RP or if resisted by using 2d6 + Body vs. the victims 2d6 + Body (Both must be witnessed by a Host or ST).  This contact must be maintained for the entire activation time of the mastery and if the contact is broken before it is successfully activated the mastery fails.  <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
(e.g. it takes two rounds to activate a mastery being used on someone then you must hold onto them the full two rounds)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>FEC ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Forced eye Contact Masteries can only be used within conversation distance (roughly 15 feet).  In order to catch a persons eye and maintain contact the user must roll 2d6 + Will vs. the targets 2d6 + Inits (This pits the users will against the targets ability to be quick enough to not look or break contact).  This contact must be maintained for the entire activation time of the mastery and if the contact is broken before it is successfully activated the mastery fails.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>LOS ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Line of Sight Masteries require just that, a line of sight.  The target of the mastery can be any distance as long as they can see the target.  This contact must be maintained for the entire activation time of the mastery and if the contact is broken before it is successfully activated the mastery fails.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Note:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Lycanthrope Masteries are split in to five sections, General, Wolf, Bear, Gator, and Quttah.  A Lycanthrope may only buy from General and their animal type.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the Lycanthrope possesses a natural animal quickness, which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the lycanthrope, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> Having such an incredible bond between pack mates, lycnathropes have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during times of war.  The lycanthrope can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its pack mates, regardless of distance.  Each pack mate must have the mastery Call The Pack to be included in the Mindspeak.  The pack must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The pack member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their pack name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the pack member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Pack members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B></I>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Cunning animals can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near.  For all intents and purposes, the lycanthrope is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the lycanthrope -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The lycanthrope will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Lycanthropes under dispas cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  Lycanthropes also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous.  In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone.  No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc.  If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the lycanthrope change into Dispas, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the lycanthrope is, provided the lycanthrope has not yet left the area.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>The lycanthrope has learned to seek others out by further expanding the mastery : Mindspeak.  This allows the lycanthrope to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the lycanthrope is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the lycanthrope must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lycanthrope is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the lycanthrope attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The lycanthrope can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lycanthrope takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the lycanthrope can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A lycanthrope's sense of smell is so strong and acute, that their sense of smell can sometimes compensate for their sense of sight.  Lycanthropes that utilize their sense of smell can effectively "see" in complete darkness.  It can distinguish between the many different scents around him and can pinpoint their exact location.  This allows the lycanthrope to ignore any penalties due to vision.  Strong winds or powerful smells can throw the lycanthrope off.  The nuances are up to the room host, ST or GM.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>By baring it's claws and maws and issuing forth a frightening roar, the lycanthrope can paralyze its victim with fear.  If successful, the victim will be at -4 to Attack and Quickness for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in.<BR>

<B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene; Instant<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Due to the lycanthrope's innate healing system and mind set, its body is able to handle the stress of physical attacks better than any other creature.  They are more resilient to the damage they can take before pain begins to affect their abilities.  A lycanthrope with Dulled Pain ignores changes to their modifiers that would normally take effect through the loss of Body for the first 3 points of damage.  See Below Example:<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>	<U>Damage Suffered                 Effective Damage <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U>		   	1-3							0<BR>
		    	4							1<BR>
		     	5							2<BR>
			6							3<BR>
			etc...						etc...<BR>
With this example A werewolf with 10 Body that just suffered a pistol shot would normally be at 7 body and all body effecting modifiers would drop by 3.  With Dulled Pain however they would be affected at all.  If that same wolf was hit by another gunshot for 3 body damage, they would now be at a -3 to all Body affecting mods, instead of -6.  Reguardless when the character is dropped to 0 natural Body, they pass out all the same.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The wolf nature grants certain benefits when it joins with the human.  Understanding of the wolf nature enables the werewolf to befriend mundane animals they encounter.  This is not open control, however.  It only makes the effected animal act friendly toward the werewolf.  Only mammals (smaller than a whale) can be affected in this manner.  If this mastery is used on another Player Character in an animal form, the target number is the victim's 2d6+Will.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  2d6+Will vs. victims 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some Wolves have taken an extra step when it comes to confronting their own anger. In order to understand their own anger, they have learned to bring it out in others. With a touch and a force of will, the werewolf with this mastery can goad the target into a blind and all-consuming rage. If the victim is not a werewolf, they will be <I>extremely</I> angry, likely to lash out with aggression to almost any situation. If the victim of this mastery is a werewolf, they will immediately transform Horus, regardless of the phase of the moon.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> The werewolves' olfactory senses are very sensitive, sometimes to the point where they pick up on the presence of supernatural beings.  They will instantly know what the individual's breed is if they have Lore level 3 of that breed.

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.<BR>

<B>Effect/Duration:</B>  The werewolf is a confident beast in most situations.  Their predatory instincts serve them well, guiding them with strength.  They strive to overcome.  When a werewolf's mood reflects this determination, the werewolf can strengthen it's will above and beyond it's normal capacities.  The werewolf adds +4 to all will rolls they make for the rest of the scene. This confidence is removed the moment the werewolf fails any die roll for the remainder of the night, as it's confidence is now shaken. This confidence is so powerful, that the werewolf may allow others to hit him and still not shake the werewolves ego.  Loosing initiative also doesn't count as 'loosing a die roll'.<BR>

Thus, in dire moments bears can draw upon this connection to heal themselves or others of seemingly greivous injuries, be this to strike down an abomination or to tend revenge with renewed vigor.  However, this power is not gentle on the surrounding area.  The healing energies come from nature itself and thus plant and, depending upon the energy needed, animal life may suffer.  Plants will wither, crumbling to dust and leaving a barren area around where the character healed himself.  The only exception to this is if this mastery is used in the Bears Den (The Bear has a Homestead).  Furthermore, the character must be in contact with the earth for this mastery to work.  In a parking lot he will have to burrow his hand through the gravel and if in the city he must be standing on earth and not concrete or asphalt. For every point rolled above the TN, the target regains one Body point and cannot go above his Body Statistic.  This Mastery can only be used once per night.  But as one may well imagine the energies of the earth- no matter the bond- take time to harness and thus expediency diminishes benefit.  If the werewolf is in a stressful situation (i.e. combat, or a situation the ST rules stressful) then they can only transfer one point of body to themselves or the target per round.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Effect/Description:  </B>When a werebear finds a place outdoors that he can call home, a place to go for safety and sanctuary, he uses Homestead to solidify the area's bond to him.  The area must be natural and unaltered by man in order for this mastery to be effective, as the Bear's bond with nature does not allow for any man-made structure to be suitable.  Also, the location chosen by the bear must be at least 100 yards from any man-made structure.  In order to activate this mastery the Werebear must inact an hourlong ritual preparing the land (Roughly a den more than 10 x 10 feet but no larger than 30 x 30 feet) to be his home.  This ritual must be posted in the Natural Predators Folder and linked on the Character sheet before purchase of this will be approved.  The roll must also be approved and linked as well.  After all is said and done the Werebear has a den once and forever, this den is permanent unless the land is desacrated by man.  Once activated, this sanctuary grants the bear a double healing rate for as long as he rests within the confines of his "home", this includes any masteries the Werebear uses while in his home.  This also affects damage received from fire. In addition, Homestead cannot be breached by any being in Mist Form, Unseen,  or Spirit Form. Transcended beings -can- enter this protected area, but may not unTranscend while remaining within the boundaries of Homestead.  This does not bar people from entering his "home", only people that are not in physical form.<BR>
       Note: Homestead is considered to be the Bears home in relation to vampires entering.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> The werewolves' olfactory senses are very sensitive, sometimes to the point where they pick up on the presence of supernatural beings.  They will instantly know what the individual's breed is if they have Lore level 3 of that breed.

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.<BR>

When a successful attack is made the Gator makes this roll and if successful the Victim is automatically grappled and takes an additional 2 body damage.  Further rules for grappling still apply.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Weregator is inherently a beast.  As all beasts, they tend to strike wildly when in extreme danger.  A Weregator who has been brought down to half their current body level, or below, will lash out, attacking the closest objects to it.  If not already in Horus, will transform, then attack.  Adds +2 to attack and +1 to Inits.  The Weregator will attack the two nearest targets even if they are friends  (ST will determine).  This makes attacking a wounded Were potentially dangerous since their bodies will instinctively lash out.  It is simply a lashing out, meaning that the Were will not charge someone to attack.  The target must be in close range.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Unknown to most, the gator is a sensitive creature...feeling every little thing, even in its surrounding swamps.  But like all animals they have defences for such events.  Being a battle ready creature, they have managed a way to strengthen their hides.  Making their bodies an armored suit of reptillian scales.  They are more resilient to the damage they can take before pain begins to affect their abilities.  A Weregator with Scales reduces the damage done to them by -1 for the duration of the mastery.  No attack can be reduced to less than one damage with this mastery.  This mastery is cumulative with the natural armor the Gators possess.<BR>
