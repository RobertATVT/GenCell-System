I recall the normal genned sheets going through the CS department, but thought Pharaoh and Paradox might want to be CCed on it. Let me know if that's not how you want it done.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Lycanthropes have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the Lycanthrope will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1<BR>
Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

(##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus<BR>
reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  Each Horus Form has it's own certain benefits and penalties, see the description below for the details.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Werebear -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The Werebear is truly an awesome creature when in this form, no other form hold the mass and power of this form.  When a Werebear commits to this form the mortal body gains an additional 90% addition to height and a further 105% addition to weight.  While in this form the Werebear is a massive fur covered creature with the contemplative head of a Bear and it's hands end in great long clawed fingers.  In some cases a Werebears claws can be as lengthy as 6-7 inches, truly a horrific sight.  The only thing close to a tail the Werebear has is a slightly protruding stub from their spine, not giving much purpose to<BR>
aid in movement or balance.  While in this form the Werebears gain a +4 to Body, but their speed is reduced by 50% (Takes three rounds to escape from Combat, etc..) and they may not use Healing oriented Masteries (Lick of the Mother Bear, Homestead, etc..).  Werebears do not gain the Mastery limitation or resistance as Werewolves do.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:  </B>2d6+Body vs TN 12 / Scene; Instant<B><BR>
Effect/Description:</B>  Lycanthrope's have extremely active senses, surpassing both human and animal  characteristics.  When a situation arises where a player feels they can use these, they simply state it.  The only drawback is that only one sense may be enhanced at any given time.  <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight/Nightvision -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The Lycanthrope can see twice as far as a normal human and in almost no light.  If they are in total darkness, or close to total darkness, they will not<BR>
be able to see as far.  Vision penalties brought on from darkness are reduced by half while this mastery is in effect.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Hearing -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The Lycanthrope can hear 10 times better than a normal human, concentrating on whispers across a noisy room, or picking up the breaking of a twig.  While this<BR>
sense is active the Lycanthrope can over hear conversations from across rooms and hear the footfalls of even the quietest of people.  Even conversations that are <vvvvvvvqw> may be overheard, however Mindspeak may never be overheard this way.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Smell -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The Lycanthrope's sense of smell is extremely enhanced, to the point where the Lycanthrope is capable of using it to distinguish between different scents and assist<BR>
in tracking.  Enhanced Senses reduces the TN for tracking by -4.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A Lycanthrope who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their animal forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in animal form, they gain +1 Body.  All animal forms are subject to Forum Director or Breed Advisor approval.<BR>

Appearance(clothes, etc..): </B>John is a big man, Tall and thick. His clothing is normally that of jeans, blue flannel shirt and an old faded leather jacket. His face is coated in a light beard and his body is generally covered in a light dusting of hair. Very hearty with very broad shoulders. He's slightly overly muscular but because of his husky build this isn't all together noticeable.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Tight and faded blue jeans riddled with small rips and tears clung to his thighs, His shirt was black and covered in a light dust, it was just an ordinary haines five dollar shirt. Pulled over this was a light brown and water spotted leather jacket, the elbows were patched with two thick leather squares and roughly sewn back over the original leather. <BR>
<BR>
His face was bord a bit fat, he was a little bit chubby even to it. Standing at about six foot four and weighing two hundred and twenty pounds. His face was roughly shaven, it was always that way, it had been that way as long as he could remember. he would shave it and by the time he looked in the mirror it was there again. About one-fourth of an inch of hair running across his face. His chest was hairy two, thigh black swirls of hair, not overly thick but thick enough to know he needed a shirt on. As far as he knew he had a hairy back but he never bothered to try to look at the broad thing.<BR>
<BR>
Hanging in his hand, wrapped in thick dirty fingers and nails with thick layers of dirt or oil under them was a half dented in budweiser, the alcohol twirled inside. Sloshing around as he stumbled across the side of the road, inside of the leather coat hidden up in the breast pocket was a flask, it was nearly empty as well, he had been drinking heavily. So much that when the wind caught him he smelt it himself. he had a good sense of smell though.<BR>
<BR>
Most of his time he spent up in Colorado, most of his entire life t anyway, how long that was he didn't know. he knew he aged slowly ... he noticed how people seemed to fade on and away as he would wander into town every now and then. people that smelled exactly the same as before were elderly, it frightened him slightly. this difference that he felt, this distance that separated him from them. He always ran, ran away, back into the mountains and the deep Colorado forests where he would live, alone.<BR>
<BR>
He could only remember back to when he was a child, about ten years old. Him and his father had took the horses and packed them heavily for a little father and sun outing. his father was a farmer and this was a family tradition. For years the Redbud family, the father and the sun would go up into the mountains right after winter and go grizzly hunting. John had just been old enough to go. He was exhilarated, His father, John Senior had even bought him a gun, his own shot gun and he was determined to bag the bear.<BR>

They made their way up the sloping land, the white giant mountains over head seemed to go forever into the sky, almost seeming as if they would fall right on them at any moment. It was so amazing, he couldn't stop looking at them. After the long trek they made camp near a mountain spring and started a campfire, John senior had even tossed together a trap for some trout. A box made from twigs and twine, baited with bread. The design was very simple, sort of a small wooden jail with a hole on one end that was lined with in facing twigs so the fish could get in but couldn't get out. It took about an hour for him, john senior to make it but they talked while he did and that was what it was about. Bonding<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It had been late into the night, both of them were snuggled tightly in a heavy burlap sleeping blanket sleeping thirty or so yards from the spring. The small campfire they had mad was now only a pile of glowing coals, smoke lightly drifted off from it. the horses stood tied with to a tree with their walking straps, giving them about twenty feet to roam around and nibble on grass or sip from the spring ... and then ... it came.<BR>
<BR>
The foot steps crushed the ground, each padding making a loud thump from it's massive size. it's breath was even loud, sounding like wheezing seam from a train starting up, deep chugs of breath, engulfing the air and then shoving it back out with a sling of snot mixed with saliva. the thick, hair stub like snout sniffed at them from across the stream for a moment and then dunked into the water, splashing it as the huge head submerged.<BR>
<BR>
Something was wrong with this odd creature though. This huge and massive bear was tainted with a curse. it was one of the very few and extremely rare animals to live long enough to come into contact with anything. What the bear had come across is a strain of lycanthrop. Most often times this is considered a curse and when it comes to humans catching it, tangling their DNA with that of the attacking creature this myth holds water. In an animals case the ability to spread this virus is automatic. Most times however the creature is maddened and pretty much attempting to kill what it attacks but in the case it attacks something and it gets away before it is killed it has the virus.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Jun shot up at the sound, setting up and looking the other way, his eyes wandered over to the tree where the horses were tied to, seeing the shotguns. the very breath from across the stream behind him told him what it was. he crept out of the burlap bed and slowly crawled across the ground to the guns, the huge beast had stopped drinking, it looked at him for a moment but then went to fishing for the trout it the basket, leaning far over and digging it's massive arm though the water to latch onto the basket. John senior latched onto the shotgun, the heavy lead slug in it loaded and ready, the guns had been cocked before they went to bed.<BR>
<BR>
He lifted the barrel and aimed at the beast, crossing the hairs over the bears head and then he fired. The bear slung back though the air as thick, almost black blood shot out from it's shoulder, John started to load another slug, John junior woke up confused, looking around franticly after the explosion of the high caliber shot ... it was at this time when he first heard the call.<BR>
<BR>
It was loud, Like thunder, So deep you could feel it inside of you, Shaking him and dropping him into confusion and fear.  The beat roared at them, seemingly unharmed yet blood spilled heavily from it's shoulder, Little john just stood terrified as the bear started across the spring, running to his father like a storm coming over, something he could feel, an unstoppable force. His father managed to get one last shot off before the bear got to him. John couldn't remember what the bear exactly did to his dad, he looked away. After a few pleader screams from his father to run there was silence.<BR>
<BR>
The bear, Shot and bleeding profusely drunkenly started for him. He couldn't run, He was afraid. tears streamed down his face and breathing became hard when he seen his father sprawled out on the ground by the trees. The bear walking towards him still, limping and becoming slower and slower didn't matter now. He just stood watched as it drew closer. The sounds of it's paws hitting the ground and it's heavy breathing filling him, he stood and watched as it stepped up to him and screamed a last blood curdling roar in his face. It's hot breath rushing over him, saliva dripping down on top of him. he just stood there and watched as it reared it's paw high in the air and then forced it back down, hitting his chest with the tips of it's claws making four diagonal lines all the way across it, each about half an inch thick and then it fell to the ground and died.<BR>
<BR>
Now here he was. Walking to the small town as a man, it had been so long ago now but the memory was as if was yesterday. He would have never even came out of the forest but there was no forest left. The area had since been commercialized and ran though with factories. He wasn't sure how much time passed, he knew it was a long time though. He had to get away from them, go to at least a quite place, a small town where he could be alone and safely hide his secret because he knew he was dangerous. So, he stole a car and just drove and here in this place... Voletta is where it stopped.... Perhaps it was fate.... John believed in that as much as he believed that he was a dangerous creature..... the very one that killed his father.<BR>
