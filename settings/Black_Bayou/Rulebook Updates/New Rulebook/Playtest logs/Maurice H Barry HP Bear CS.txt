<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Lycanthropes have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the Lycanthrope will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  Each Horus Form has it's own certain benefits and penalties, see the description below for the details.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Werebear -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> The Werebear is truly an awesome creature when in this form, no other form hold the mass and power of this form.  When a Werebear commits to this form the mortal body gains an additional 90% addition to height and a further 105% addition to weight.  While in this form the Werebear is a massive fur covered creature with the contemplative head of a Bear and it's hands end in great long clawed fingers.  In some cases a Werebears claws can be as lengthy as 6-7 inches, truly a horrific sight.  The only thing close to a tail the Werebear has is a slightly protruding stub from their spine, not giving much purpose to aid in movement or balance.  While in this form the Werebears gain a +4 to Body, but their speed is reduced by 50% (Takes three rounds to escape from Combat, etc..) and they may not use Healing oriented Masteries (Lick of the Mother Bear, Homestead, etc..).  Werebears do not gain the Mastery limitation or resistance as Werewolves do.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration:  </B>2d6+Body vs TN 12 / Scene; Instant<B><BR>
Effect/Description:</B>  Lycanthrope's have extremely active senses, surpassing both human and animal  characteristics.  When a situation arises where a player feels they can use these, they simply state it.  The only drawback is that only one sense may be enhanced at any given time.  <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Sight/Nightvision -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> The Lycanthrope can see twice as far as a normal human and in almost no light.  If they are in total darkness, or close to total darkness, they will not be able to see as far.  Vision penalties brought on from darkness are reduced by half while this mastery is in effect.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Hearing -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> The Lycanthrope can hear 10 times better than a normal human, concentrating on whispers across a noisy room, or picking up the breaking of a twig.  While this sense is active the Lycanthrope can over hear conversations from across rooms and hear the footfalls of even the quietest of people.  Even conversations that are <vvvvvvvqw> may be overheard, however Mindspeak may never be overheard this way.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Smell -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> The Lycanthrope's sense of smell is extremely enhanced, to the point where the Lycanthrope is capable of using it to distinguish between different scents and assist in tracking.  Enhanced Senses reduces the TN for tracking by -4.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A Lycanthrope who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their animal forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in animal form, they gain +1 Body.  All animal forms are subject to Forum Director or Breed Advisor approval.<BR>
 <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><I>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lycanthrope is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lycanthrope will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>

<B></I>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Cunning animals can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near.  For all intents and purposes, the lycanthrope is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the lycanthrope -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The lycanthrope will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Lycanthropes under dispas cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  Lycanthropes also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous.  In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone.  No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc.  If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the lycanthrope change into Dispas, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the lycanthrope is, provided the lycanthrope has not yet left the area.<BR>

<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U>The mustached salt and pepper haired Maurice,having grown up in and about the banyan and cypress of the bayou had a love for his surroundiings leading him to protect it as if of hiw own kin.Living the life of most cajun's,the swamp his home;a major part of his life.Naturally leading him to the life of a game warden,his long duty and search for knowledge getting attention from a college professor as he studied both law and ecology.His main love was music,soul and r & b;a rich baritone.<BR>
    While trailing a group of poachers.A group seeking the black bear now getting rare in the wild environs of Lousiana.A commitmant to save them and see their species renewed and balance restored to what it once was in the swamps.His goals drove him to become educated about them and the swamp habitat.Years of study and fighting to see them continue led him to a fateful encounter,one that would and did change his life forever.Poachers seeking organs and parts to fill the rapidly booming asian market. .A mother and her twin cubs,he had been watching them and studyng them for sometime now had crossed the path of the poachers.While tough and resourceful he had been pressed to his limits and it looked grim.He could not fail,he would not see them shot just for a gall bladder and to be lost for parts to make some impotent asian man think himself a stud.<BR>
     So,calling for backup;that he knew would be too late to help.He pulled his .357 out and with a hoot and a holler managed to scare the bears.Angering the the poachers a shootout was unfortunetly ineveitable.One of the cubs going down shot in the hindquarters.His form moving protectively over it while he shot back.Taking hits,most being deflected by his kevlar vest;always prepared he was.A few had found thier marks and wounded the man sorely.But he'd die before they won.A sight that confused him,the bear looking at him;the mother with sad eyes at him then the pochers with a inner fire.She seemed to shift and change before his eyes into some abominable manbeast.She and more?! Appeared out of nowhere and descended upon the hapless poachers as bloodloss and wounds made him pass out.<BR>
    Waking,something that took him as a miracle;he looked about a simple dwelling to see a amerind woman of noble bearing,her walk proud and as a force of nature;to be reckoned with.Her name,Mary Walksfarwoman.Explaining of her people and of her children,of her gratitude for his willing sacrifice and of the earth mothers acceptance of it and his new life to come.She prepared him for it,and with that night he walked out into th the swamp with her.Telling him to see if he could escape,such a small woman as she;she started to change and seeing that beast form again he ran like the wind.Almost escaping the gift in fact,but at last she caught him and with a growl lept upon him to knock him down with a swipe to his left shoulder.A mark he weras to this day with pride.A bite and blackness obvercame him.Smacks to his face woke him to her shining smile,and to  one or two others with a johnboat.Taking himback to her home she started to tell tales,weaving them into songs and lessons for one newly welcomed to the children of the moon,and of ursa.<BR>
	Deciding to go back to his true love,music;he know seeks to be among people to share his gift.The smooth rich baritone,and impeccable style that marked Maurice.<BR>
