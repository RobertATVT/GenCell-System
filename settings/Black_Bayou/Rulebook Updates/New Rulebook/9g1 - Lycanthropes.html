Most people have no idea what a Lycanthrope truly is, but those that do know that a certain amount of power lies behind the claws and teeth.  Lycanthropy is a genetic Virus that attacks the host on a genetic level and alters the DNA code.  This alteration leaves them wide open to the spirit world and leaves their bodies able to change shape into the animal form of the Virus.<BR>
<BR>
Lycanthropes have throughout history ravaged through villages, and slaughtered helpless victims.  Terrible legends abound through central Europe about the horrifying Lycanthropes that scare people to hide in their homes.  Southern US and other locations also speak about about the great reptiles that slaughter farmers and their animals, the Weregators.<BR>
<BR>
Not all Legends of Lycanthropes are of horrific nature however, throughout central US and parts of Russia stories abound about people being saved by great bears, pulled into the safety of their dens and cared for through illness.  The Werebears have always been rumored to be protective and slow to anger, though when they are angered it burns for centuries.  Other stories are whispered about the seductive and carefree cats that wander the world.  Pristine creatures that use charm and guile to sway people, but at the heart of every cat is a hunter.  Beware the Quttah, the Werecats.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B> To become a Lycanthrope, you must first be chosen by the creator.  This Lycanthrope must spend 6 hours in a ritual (must be posted) in which they focus on their target. Dancing around a bonfire, occasionally tossing in something personal of the Lycanthrope-to-be.  At the conclusion of the ritual, the Lycanthrope goes immediately Horus and then tracks down the target. The tracking is automatic and the Horus will take whatever means necessary to reach the target. Once the hunt has ended, the Lycanthrope will attack the target, attempting to bite them.  Unfortunately for most, the Horus is a maddened beast nearly impossible to control.  In order for the Lycanthrope to control itself and not kill the target, they must attempt to control the insane beast they have become.  To do so, they must successfully roll 2d6+Will vs. TN: 20.  Lycanthropes no longer roll this after 4 months of their own breed generation as they have learned to control the beast inside just enough.  If the Lycanthrope is 4 months or older AND has a Will stat of 20 or more, they can create another Lycanthrope without an ST or GM being present.  This siring must be posted in the STs lair and the CSs verified before the incident is considered official.  If the intended target resists the bite, none of the above applies as an ST or GM must be there.  If the Lycanthrope is NOT 4 months old and/or has a Will less than 20, this roll must be witnessed by either a GM or ST.  If the Lycanthrope fails this roll, they tear the victim to pieces in a blind rage.  Should this roll be successful, as well as a successful attack roll for the bite itself, the green froth around its mouth enters the targets bloodstream. One bite is enough and the Horus will immediately flee, having bitten its target. Over the next few days or weeks, the virus will work its way through the target's body.  On the night of the next full moon, the target will unexpectedly fly into Horus for the first time and will immediately begin a hunt.  The player must then roll 2d6+Will vs a TN of 24.  Success means the Lycanthrope will find the scent of and track down their intended target.  If the roll is failed, the creature will follow any scents of people, wherever they lead.  It is not unheard of for a Lycanthrope to attack a city or town during its first transformation.  In fact, that is where some of the rumors about Lycanthrope attacks occurring during the full moon come form.  Once it kills its first victim, (for gaming purposes, once it has reduced the CS to negative numbers) the newly created Lycanthrope will change back to mortal form, the curse complete (this must be witnessed by a GM or ST and posted).  If the Lycanthrope is killed in its attack (Body reduced to negative its Body total as per the Mortal breed) they will die as they haven't completely reverted to a Lycanthrope until AFTER successfully accomplishing this attack.  If there is some reason that the Lycanthrope-to-be missed the full moon (captured underground, etc.) they will turn Horus each evening upon return/release (once they can see the sky again) during the hours of darkness until they either kill a victim or are killed themselves.<BR>

However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the Lycanthrope is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to a Lycanthrope, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.  Lycanthropes age at a very reduced rate and could theoretically live almost forever.<BR>

You believe there are physical signs of the Lycanthrope (unibrow, fingers of the same length, etc.) You believe they cannot touch silver objects. You are wary of the dreaded bite of the Lycanthrope, as you still believe a random bite will curse you as well.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Wolfsbane:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Most animals have a plant that Wolfsbane is a plant of varying size originally found in Europe.  How the plant managed to make its way to the United States is anyone's guess.  The spores of this plant that grow just beneath the petals of the yellowish flowers are believed to have a particularly distasteful odor that can only be noticed by canines.  Whether this is true or not is irrelevant.  It's the faith in the horrible stench of the herb that causes Lycanthropes to be repulsed by it.  Wolfsbane can be found in most herbal shops around the country.  Holding the wolfsbane aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the herb and the Lycanthrope they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the Lycanthrope's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the Lycanthrope's roll, they are successful.  The Lycanthrope must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the Lycanthrope from fleeing until the duration wears off and it even works on a Lycanthrope in Horus form.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the Lycanthrope may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the Lycanthrope will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the Lycanthrope is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of wolfsbane will only serve to enrage the Lycanthrope, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  The Lycanthrope will also change into their Horus form (if not already there) unless they attempt to resist the change with a standard roll.  It is not possible for one Lycanthrope to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>

Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false. You believe that any type of silver can kill a Lycanthrope, once it enters the bloodstream. You also know that Lycanthropes can shape shift into the form of a animal. You still believe, however, that the Lycanthropes' change into the monstrous form is related only to the full moon. You also realize merely touching silver has no effect on them. Having studied Lycanthropes for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a Lycanthrope uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the Lycanthrope use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bane Water: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Bane water is little more than water used to boil the wolfsbane herb that has been empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  The water must have been used to boil wolfsbane and posted in the ST's Lair message board area each day it is used.  The empowering with faith must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the bane water in whatever item they intend to attack the Lycanthrope with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of bane water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the Lycanthrope are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the Lycanthrope suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The Lycanthrope must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Lycanthrope heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Lycanthrope by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Lycanthrope, which happens to be Horus.  If you wish to identify the Lycanthrope as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Lycanthrope, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Lycanthrope transform either to or from Horus.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Lycanthrope.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Silver Bullet:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>To kill a Lycanthrope, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the Lycanthrope's natural healing abilities.  Lycanthropes happen to be susceptible to a silver bullet that penetrates their brain.  The bullet used must be made of silver.  The bullet has to be a solid slug, like that from a handgun.  Unlike a shotgun loaded with silver pellets that spray over an area.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must fire the silver bullet directly into the fallen Lycanthrope's head.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, focusing it on the bullet as it is fired.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for hitting the prone Lycanthrope so long as the range is point blank.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the silver will kill the Lycanthrope instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if it misses (at long range) it will not kill the Lycanthrope.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  The Lycanthrope will appear to be mortal after it has died.<BR>

This horrifying form, known as Horus, must be role-played as a raging beast, much like a rabid wolf. Rational thought stripped away and pure instinct takes hold.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror. The Lycanthrope can feel the urge of Horus and, if they resist, can hold off the change for no longer than 2 minutes.  If they do not resist, they assume Horus within 30 seconds.  If you conveniently try to leave Horus in order to not take a life in character, then you may be cited with OOC Manipulation.  The Horus has no rational thought and will stop at nothing to rip its victim limb from limb.<BR>

During the new moon, the Lycanthrope if at its most calm and friendly. As the moon nears Crescent and Half, the Lycanthrope's moods begin to grow and intensify. From the Gibbous moon to the Full moon, the Lycanthrope's attitude has worsened to an extent that they are difficult to be around. The intensity of the situation leading to Horus depends on the phase of the moon, as well.<BR>

Anytime even the slightest thing might upset a Lycanthrope during the 3 days that make up a full moon (the day before, day of and day after), they must roll 2d6+Will vs TN: 24.  If this roll is failed, the Lycanthrope will change to Horus, the target being whatever caused the irritation.  After the first three months, the Lycanthrope has learned to control their inner beast enough so they can control the random full moon changes, but not the changes anger brings.<BR>

In some cases a Werebears claws can be as lengthy as 6-7 inches, truly a horrific sight.  The only thing close to a tail the Werebear has is a slightly protruding stub from their spine, not giving much purpose to aid in movement or balance.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><I>Behavior:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B></I>  Quttah by themselves are almost a breed apart from the rest.  They are very territorial and protective of their things.  Quttah are also a very secretive lot and hold dearly to any secret told to them.  As a result they tend to get really miffed if a secret told to someone "gets out" or you mess with their things.  Quttah don't tend to fight unless cornered, and nine times out of ten they will only fight long enough to clear a path to get away. <BR>

Effect/Description:</B>  Lycanthrope's have extremely active senses, surpassing both human and animal  characteristics.  When a situation arises where a player feels they can use these, they simply state it.  The only drawback is that only one sense may be enhanced at any given time.  <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight/Nightvision -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The Lycanthrope can see twice as far as a normal human and in almost no light.  If they are in total darkness, or close to total darkness, they will not be able to see nearly as far.  Vision penalties brought on from darkness are reduced by half while this mastery is in effect.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Hearing -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The Lycanthrope can hear 10 times better than a normal human, concentrating on whispers across a noisy room, or picking up the breaking of a twig.  While this sense is active the Lycanthrope can over hear conversations from across rooms and hear the footfalls of even the quietest of people.  Even conversations that are <vvvvvvvqw> may be overheard, however Mindspeak may never be overheard this way.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Smell -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The Lycanthrope's sense of smell is extremely enhanced, to the point where the Lycanthrope is capable of using it to distinguish between different scents and assist in tracking.  Enhanced Senses reduces the TN for tracking by -4.  (Cannot be used in conjunction with Scent recognition)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A Lycanthrope who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their animal forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in animal form, they gain +1 Body.  All animal forms are subject to Forum Director or Breed Advisor approval.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lycanthrope is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lycanthrope will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>
