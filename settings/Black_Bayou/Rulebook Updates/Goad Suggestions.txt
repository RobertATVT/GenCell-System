See easy ... and it evens up a huge unbalance...well ... it helps.<BR>

Drawl backs for the wolf? It would now have to grapple to use goad ... it would still have to fight the victim ... goad only last so long so then the werewolf could be blasted to death with masteries ... but it's a start.</HTML>
