</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#408080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Hello. After giving this mastery careful thought, getting input from players and placing  it on the Message Boards, this is the final product that I've come up with for a new Vampire True Form. The players have said that the current TF for Vampires is not to their liking, 75 points for wrinkly skin and +2 body not very logical. Also, the +2 body for Vampires isn't very logical as well, since Vampires are designed as mentally based breeds instead of physical. I hope that you take this suggestion into careful consideration, for I feel that this would not only make the Vampire TF more popular, but more logical and balanced. If you'd like for me to explain any of my reasons behind this mastery or make any suggestions as to how this mastery could be made better to increase the chances of it being approved, then please feel free to E-mail. I'll be more than happy to do -anything- to get this mastery for the Vampires into play for I feel that this is something I'd spend the XP on and have lots of fun RPing as well. It's the sort of mastery that just makes you want to use it for the potential and the fun that it'll bring, which is the point behind a lot of masteries and the foundation for this game. Thanks you. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>Vampires are naturally dark creatures, the night their allies and the shadows their guide. By drawing in the night and the darkness around them, the Vampire achieves the true form nature designed for them. Darkness and the night's very energies flow directly into the Vampire, the dark powers molding the Vampire into what it was originally designed to be. In a rush of sudden, extreme pain, the Vampire takes on a form unnatural to common beings, though the feeling is amazingly comfortable, if not a relief to the Vampire. The Vampire's eyes take on an unnaturally red glow, pearly fangs extending, unable to be retracted while in the form, extreme power flooding through the creatures very veins. The Vampire's muscle mass may increase slightly increasing strength and power slightly. The Vampire's flesh splits open in two areas going from neck to lower back, massive<BR>
leathery wings bursting out of the Vampire's new slits. The Vampire may carry himself and no more than 10 extra lbs while in flight. The Vampire can travel no faster than 25 MPH. The Vampire's bloodlust will increase, the taste of blood dramatically increasing in taste and flavor increasing the bloodrush TN from 20 to 24. Pure evil flows in and out of the creature, the urge to be kind and good incredibly hard to maintain. Madness enters the Vampire's brain, the rush to run even in a near impossible situation almost nonexistent, though one can still flee. The moral and battle rushes are for RP purposes only and require no roll to avoid. In this form, the Vampire gains +2 mind and +1 body. If the Vampire goes to 0 mind or 0 body, the darkness will leave the Vampire. This mastery can only be used at nighttime.<BR>
