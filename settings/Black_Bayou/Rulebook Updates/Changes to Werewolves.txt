<BR>
The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> There are two ways in which a human can become a Werewolf: random attack by the beast that rages on the full moon or being chosen by a Werewolf and primed for the change to this breed, followed by a ritual to complete it.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Random Attacks:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  In myths and legends throughout history, there are storys of attacks by Mother Natures most feared of creatures.  During the night of the full moon, the beast takes over on auto pilot due to Luna's pull on the animalistic side within a Werewolf.  It is not uncommon for a Werewolf to bite anyone, known or unknown to the more human element of the half-man half-beast, in the span of this night.  Should a Werewolf happen across someone that looks like a tasty morsel, with a simple and yet painful bite, the virus can be passed from the Werewolf to a human without the mental preporation of a ritual.  The call of the beast at this time is something that cannot be controlled, and rather than a focused attack, random attacks can and will happen on anyone that the beast deams fit at the moment.  For this bite to stick and the bitten human to become a Werewolf, a roll of 2D6+Attack vs 2D6+Will is rolled by the Werewolf and the victim.  If the Werewolf wins the roll, the virus merges with the cells of the Mortal. Once the bite happens, the beast loses the urge to attack and will immediately flee. This bite must be wittnessed by an ST or GM and must be posted in the ST Lair, reguardless of the age if the Werewolf character.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Ritual:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  For those lucky enough to be chosen by a Werewolf creator to share the gift of this lifestyle, a bonding happens between the Werewolf and the human during a ritual done by the Werewolf creator itself.  This ritual has no time limit, other than no less than an hour, for the bonding of souls between both the human and the beast.  At the conclusion of the ritual, the werewolf goes immediately Horus and then tracks down the target. The tracking is automatic and the Horus will take whatever means necessary to reach the target. Once the hunt has ended, the werewolf will attack the target, attempting to bite them.  Unfortunately for most, the Horus is a maddened beast nearly impossible to control.  In order for the werewolf to control itself and not kill the target, they must attempt to control the insane beast they have become. To do so, they must successfully roll 2d6+Will vs. TN: 20.  This bite must be wittnessed by an ST or GM and must be posted in the ST Lair, reguardless of the age if the Werewolf character.  If the Werewolf fails this roll, they tear the victim to pieces in a blind rage.  Should this roll be successful, as well as a successful attack roll for the bite itself, the Werewolf flees.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>* Ok, I would change the becoming and lemme put it this way...Vamps don't have to kill a PC character the first time they feed.  Lamia don't have to get naked and dance around a may pole.  Psychic's don't have to call up Dion Warwick.  Demons don't have to have a meeting with Satan to sex him up.  Blah blah.  No other breed in the game can be killed the first time they go true form, other than the Weres.  Makes no sense and it should be changed to something like what follows*</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Successful Bites:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  One bite by a Werewolf is enough for the virus to merge with the cells in the victim or target.  Over the next few days or weeks, the virus will work its way through the target's body.  The human might notice changes to how it's body reacts to things around it during this time. Hearing improves, eyesight improves some, the sense of smell becomes stronger.  Nearing the end of the month and growing closer to the full moon, the humans emotions run wild, a normally calm person would seem high strung or a high strung person might have fits of temper and wild mood swings.<BR>
<BR>
On the night of the full moon, (for RP purposes the day of and after or directly following those should the player not be able to be on line those nights - one of these nights must be mandatory for the RP) the virus infects the human fully, sending the human into it's first transformation.  With no will power at this sensitive point of the month, the human is unable to contol the effect that it's body has over it's mind, rational thought flees being replaced with the need to hunt in Horus form. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> * Ok, about this part and the changes to it - it is a virus that makes a Werewolf when it takes over the human cells.  A kill should have nothing to do with the virus at all.  I'd like to see it changed so that new weres are not forced into a place where they -have- to take a PC character to body 0 and become a sitting duck.  If it was the 'drive' to hunt, rather than the 'Kill itself', this would make a heck of a lot more sense and keep people from wanting to play a breed that they can be killed on their first change.  Not that many wolves can kill when they are new, and this little rule has been a beef to me for some time since it's simply not fair compaired to the other breeds becoming things.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>First Time Horus:  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>The drive to join in natures food chain is strong on the night of the first change into Horus.  It is not unheard of for a werewolf to attack a city or town during its first transformation.  In fact, that is where some of the rumors about werewolf attacks occurring during the full moon come form.  While the Horus does not need to kill so much as to hunt and attack, (it is the virus in the cells that makes a Werewolf and not the ability to hunt or kill) a player must roll 2d6+Will vs a TN of 24 to track a certain victim.  This victim must be a PC character.  Success means the werewolf will find the scent of and track down their intended target.  If the roll is failed, the creature will follow the scents of people, wherever they lead.  Once a Horus attacks a victim, the need for this hunt is over but can continue.  It's not uncommon for a Werewolf to attack several people in one setting.  Keep in mind that Horus does not have rational thought patterns, it will attack until either the victim/target seems to be dead (for gaming purposes, once it has reduced the CS to negative numbers) or until the Horus suffers physical harm itself.  This attack on the first full moon is mandatory, and must be wittnessed by a ST or GM and the roll posted in the ST Lair.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Please note:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> only one werewolf may be created by any single werewolf per week.<BR>

However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the werewolf is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to a werewolf, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.  Werewolves age at a very reduced rate and could theoretically live almost forever.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Werewolves.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><I> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> You have watched many horror movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue. You believe simply shooting a werewolf with a silver bullet will kill them. You believe them to be creatures of the night who change into a horrific beast by the light of a full moon. You believe there are physical signs of the werewolf (unibrow, fingers of the same length, etc.) You believe they cannot touch silver objects.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>You are wary of the dreaded bite of the werewolf, as you still believe a random bite will curse you as well.</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>* This needs to come out if we are gonna allow random attacks in the Becoming - which would pretty much kill the idea of people ignoring rampaging Horus if they thought they could be changed by them.* </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Wolfsbane:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Wolfsbane is a plant of varying size originally found in Europe.  How the plant managed to make its way to the United States is anyone's guess.  The spores of this plant that grow just beneath the petals of the yellowish flowers are believed to have a particularly distasteful odor that can only be noticed by canines.  Whether this is true or not is irrelevant.  It's the faith in the horrible stench of the herb that causes werewolves to be repulsed by it.  Wolfsbane can be found in most herbal shops around the country.  Holding the wolfsbane aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the herb and the werewolf they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the werewolf's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the werewolf's roll, they are successful.  The werewolf must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the werewolf from fleeing until the duration wears off and it even works on a werewolf in Horus form.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the werewolf may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the werewolf will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the werewolf is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of wolfsbane will only serve to enrage the werewolf, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B> The werewolf will also change into their Horus form (if not already there) unless they attempt to resist the change with a standard roll.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>It is not possible for one werewolf to use this warding method on another of its kind.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>* This needs to be removed as well.  We are the only breed that is forced to show it's true form should we win just a Lore 1 roll.  It's silly that it says we can ignore it, and then in the same breath says that it forces us into true form.  It needs to go one way or the other, and I think that being able to ignore it, or just attack BUT NOT IN TRUE FORM, would be ok.*</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of werewolves. Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false. You believe that any type of silver can kill a werewolf, once it enters the bloodstream. You also know that werewolves can shape shift into the form of a wolf. You still believe, however, that the werewolves' change into the monstrous form is related only to the full moon. You also realize merely touching silver has no effect on them. Having studied werewolves for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a werewolf uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>(masteries requiring the werewolf use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>* This needs to be gone.  We can use things like Dispas (Will), Extended Mindspeak (Will), Goad (Will), and Terror (Will) during combat, so why that's in there I have no idea.* </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bane Water: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Bane water is little more than water used to boil the wolfsbane herb that has been empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  The water must have been used to boil wolfsbane and posted in the ST's Lair message board area each day it is used.  The empowering with faith must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the bane water in whatever item they intend to attack the werewolf with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of bane water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the werewolf are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the werewolf suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The werewolf must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the werewolf heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

The rituals required to pass the curse of lycanthropy are known to you.  Having studied werewolves for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a werewolf uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>(masteries requiring the werewolf use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>* Again -this needs to be gone or changed to something like Lore rolls cannot be done on a Werewolf in combat.  The way that it reads now we can't use masteries and I think what they were trying to say was that during combat, you don't have time to make Lore rolls...or something..so the victim can't take the time to do a Lore roll then on Masterys that can be used in Human form by a Werewolf*<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Werewolf by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Werewolf, which happens to be Horus.  If you wish to identify the Werewolf as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Werewolf, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Werewolf transform either to or from Horus.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Werewolf.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Silver Bullet:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>To kill a werewolf, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the werewolf's natural healing abilities.  Werewolves happen to be susceptible to a silver bullet that penetrates their brain.  The bullet used must be made of silver.  The bullet has to be a solid slug, like that from a handgun.  Unlike a shotgun loaded with silver pellets that spray over an area.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must fire the silver bullet directly into the fallen werewolf's head.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, focusing it on the bullet as it is fired.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for hitting the prone werewolf so long as the range is point blank.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the silver will kill the werewolf instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if it misses (at long range) it will not kill the werewolf.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  The werewolf will appear to be mortal after it has died.<BR>

This horrifying form, known as Horus, must be role-played as a raging beast, much like a rabid wolf. Rational thought stripped away and pure instinct takes hold.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Dipas, Enhanced Senses ~ Hearing , Enhanced Senses ~ Smell </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>*These should be added here, Hearing and Smell can be used to track with by an animal, even Horus that has to track things at times to find them according to the rules and TNs.  Dispas should be added because of the changes to Horus* </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> and Terror. The werewolf can feel the urge of Horus and, if they resist, can hold off the change for no longer than 2 minutes.  If they do not resist, they assume Horus within 30 seconds.  If you conveniently try to leave Horus in order to not take a life in character, then you may be cited with OOC Manipulation.  The Horus has no rational thought and will stop at nothing to rip its victim limb from limb,</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B> up until the point that the Horus takes over half it's current body in damage. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> * Again, see the changes to Horus form*</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

During the new moon, the werewolf if at its most calm and friendly. As the moon nears Crescent and Half, the werewolf's moods begin to grow and intensify. From the Gibbous moon to the Full moon, the werewolf's attitude has worsened to an extent that they are difficult to be around. The intensity of the situation leading to Horus depends on the phase of the moon, as well.<BR>

At any time during the month a Werewolf is put into a situtation involving anger, intense stress, or irritation the player must roll 2d6+Will vs TN of 24.  If this roll is failed, the Werewolf will change into Horus, the target being whatever or whoever caused this mood swing.  Three months after the virus has infected the cells of the Werewolf, the Werewolf has learned mental and emotional steadiness to avoid an anger change, yet not the random change the full moon brings.<BR>

It is the nature of the beast to tear out of the human shell for the monthly hunt that it's natural instincts demand.  For players, this is a <B>*Mandatory*</B> rule, you have to play your character in Horus at least once a month near the full moon. <BR>

This must be wittnessed by a room Host or ST and posted in the ST Lair as well as linked to your Character Sheet to show you used the mastery Horus Form.

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury. </FONT><FONT  BACK="#ffff00" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The only exception to this need to ravage the victim is if the Horus takes damage to it's own body equalling over half the Body stat, then the natural instint to survive kicks in and the Horus may flee. (Horus with a Body of 10 could flee once it's Body stat has reached 5 or under.)</FONT><FONT  BACK="#FFFFFF" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, </FONT><FONT  BACK="#ffff00" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(or a PC has reached body zero) </FONT><FONT  BACK="#FFFFFF" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some run while others fall to their knees sobbing. While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.  </FONT><FONT  BACK="#ffff00" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Enhanced Senses ~ Hearing , Enhanced Senses ~ Smell, and Dispas while masteries that involve the stat Will are still typical animalistic abilities and can be used by the Horus for the purpose of tracking a victim, fighting under abnormal circumstances or fleeing a scene.<BR>
