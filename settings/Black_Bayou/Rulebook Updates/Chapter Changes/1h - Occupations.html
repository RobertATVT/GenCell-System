</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>At one time or another, everyone acquires some sort of job.  This is the way we make our living, put clothes on our backs and food in our stomachs.  Even the most sinister vampire or the most brutal werewolf had a mundane job at one time or another.  Aside from the pay, a job grants many other benefits as well.  Each work environment teaches the employee new skills and brings out their hidden talents.<BR>
<BR>
Below is the ever growing list of occupational training available to the characters.  The rules regarding the initial purchase, changing careers and all the other information you'll need follow.  If you would like your character to have an occupation that isn't currently listed, please send an email request to the screen name: <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMail?subject=New Occupation Request">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>We will either find one that suits your purpose or work with you on creating a new one.<BR>

As you've already learned, you have 40 points to spend on various skills and masteries for your new character.  Optionally, you may also choose to spend some of those points on Occupational Training.  With each occupational training description you will find below, there will be a point cost during character generation listed.  That is the number of points it would cost you to purchase that type of occupational training for your character.  You may purchase only one type of occupational training when you initially create your character.<BR>
<BR>
If you have decided on and purchased an occupational training type, you should record it on your character sheet.  In the description of the training you will find a list of skills.  You automatically gain those skills and may record those on your character sheet as well.  The price for them is already included with the training.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Note:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Just because you purchase the occupational training during character creation, your character does not necessarily have that job in-character.  They have either had that job in the past or were trained for it and are currently looking for a job in that field.  If you wish for your character to have a job in-character, then you must find one for them in-character.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Late Bloomer<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>So, you've been mooching off of mom and dad, hiding away in college or even living off the land.  No matter how it happened, you don't have an Occupation...but you want one now.  You must role-play the new job or schooling and write a few posts about it.  You must be able to provide a link to the posts on your character sheet update.  Once that is finished, you spend the appropriate number of experience points as listed for each type of occupational training and submit your character sheet for approval.<BR>
<BR>
The benefits of this new career affect the character a bit differently than a generated one as well.  When your character chooses a career after generation, they do not automatically gain the skills listed.  Instead, they are allowed to purchase new levels for the skills listed at the posted cheaper cost.  Additionally, they gain the Advantage listed for the occupation.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Changing Careers</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Sometimes, a character may decide they want to do something different with their lives.  This is perfectly normal and happens to most of us.  There are other times when we might decide that there is nothing left for us to learn with our current career and go off to learn how to do something else.  For whatever reason, a change may occur and purchasing a new type of occupational training is a little different than purchasing the first occupation for your character.<BR>
<BR>
First of all, you must have had your current occupation in-character for at least one month before you may purchase a new one.  Next, your character must actually find the job in-character or at least the place to train.  You must role-play the new job or schooling and make a post or two about it.  You must be able to provide a link to the posts on your character sheet update.  Once that is finished, you spend the appropriate number of experience points as listed for each type of occupational training and submit your character sheet for approval.<BR>
<BR>
The benefits of the new career affect the character a bit differently as well.  When your character changes careers, they do not automatically gain the skills listed.  Instead, they are allowed to purchase new levels for the skills listed at a cheaper cost.  Additionally, they gain the Advantage listed for the occupation.  Your character will lose any advantages associated with the former Occupational Training type (except those that handle skills) when they change careers as well as the lowered skill cost.  Often, the skill available in the new career will more than make up for that.<BR>

Below you will find the list of occupational training currently available for a character in the Black Bayou game.  Below is an example of what you might find and what it all means:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Occupation Name:</B> This is what the general name of the occupational training is.<BR>
<B>Generation Cost:</B> This is the number of points you must spend during character generation to purchase the occupational training.<BR>
<B>Experience Cost:</B> This is the number of experience points you must spend to purchase the occupational training after you've begun playing.<BR>
<B>Bonus Skills:</B> If you purchase the occupation during character generation, then this is the list of skills you automatically gain when you first purchase the career and at what level you begin the skill with.  <BR>
<B>Skill Costs:</B>  If you purchase the occupation after you've begun to play your character, then you would refer to the skill costs listed here when you update your character sheet.  Listed here are certain skills that improve due to your occupation and the reduced cost you may purchase a new level with.<BR>
<B>Advantage:</B> This is the special quirk or perk of the job your character has.  The advantage only makes a difference when the character actually has the job in-character.<BR>

Who doesn't trust their 'tender?  An icon from 80s television and classic movies, the bartender has become someone we believe in, someone we confide in...well, let's face it, someone we spill our guts to.  And someone we've trusted when they stood in front of us, pouring drinks as we made scandalous deals with dark figures.  What do they know?  What could they bring down on us if they just bothered to find reason?<BR>

These organizations are deeply rooted with sub-organizations so clouded in secrecy that they often don't recognize each other in the field.

The Governor, The Mayor, The District Attorney, Circuit Court Judges, even small town civic leaders. They've built their dreams on the backs of the citizenry, which ironically have brought them to office.  Now they scheme and plot with each other, against each other, in the never-ending battle of holier than thou.  Who will rise to the surface?  Who will fall gracefully?  Who will wind up at the bottom of the Gulf in cement shoes?  Time will tell.

They are called many things from Stage Hand, Entertainment Assistant, Makeup Artist, Best Boy, Grip, Lighting Director, what have you.  These are the people who actually make the magic happen during an entertainment event.  They apply the make-up, they make sure the lighting is just right and ensure the smoke pots will ignite right on cue.  They run the mixing boards and the laser light shows.  Without their creative talents, Metallica might look more like The Dixie Chicks on stage...and The Dixie Chicks more like the Grinch who Stole Christmas.<BR>
