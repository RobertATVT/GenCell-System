</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Psychic masteries are what science would call extrasensory perception in a mortal being.  These are the abilities of the mind that go way beyond traditional science's abilities to explain.  Every mortal has the potential for using mental abilities, but it is a small few who learn to tap into it.  Fewer still are the ones who learn to master them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  the roll required to activate the mastery and the target number needed for the character to succeed / how long the effects of the masteries last.  The role-played effects of certain masteries can last a lot longer than the combat effects.  Also listed here is the number of rounds it takes to activate the mastery.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time your character tries to use a mastery, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>
<BR>
A few of their powers require touch or eye contact in order for the psychic to invade their victim.  For touch masteries, the psychic must touch them prior to the mastery having an effect (standard hand to hand roll, no damage; only if the victim refuses to be touched).  After they successfully touch the target, the system for the mastery is rolled.  The psychic must also make eye contact for masteries requiring such.  If the victim fights the eye contact, the psychic must roll 2d6+Mind vs. victim's 2d6+Body prior to rolling the mastery's activation.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some Psychics learn to control their bodies through extensive training of the mind by entering a trance like state.  They have learned how to will their body to heal itself, thus causing them to heal at an accelerated rate.  For every point above 18, 1 point of body is regained.  This cannot exceed the psychics max body score.  Due to the meditative state the Psychic must enter, this must be the last thing the Psychic does for the night.  A room host, ST or GM must be present for this mastery.  The TN is 16 if used in conjunction with the Major Medical Skill.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between friends, psychics have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The psychic can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its psychic friends <g> as one, regardless of distance.  Each psychic friend must have the mastery Call The Circle to be included in the Mindspeak.  The circle must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The psychic member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their psychic name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the family member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Psychic members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

They will become leery of those around them, and paranoid of where <I>they</I> may be lurking.  Once the initial seed is planted in the targets mind, the Psychic no longer has to concentrate, but must remain in line of sight to keep the mastery empowered.

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The psychic has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the psychic to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the psychic is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the psychic must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<I><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Dodge / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The Psychic has learned to create a small burst of force with their power.  This is harnessed and directed at a victim.  Once the roll succeeds, an invisible force slams into the victim causing 1 point of damage to the victim's Body.  The victim must be within line of sight.  If the psychic wins the roll contest by more than 5 points, the victim is knocked to the ground.  Any character on the ground suffers -4 to all physical rolls unless they have the Wrestling fighting skill.  This mastery may not be used on inanimate objects.<I><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  How would a Psychic react if they suddenly lost the ability to communicate, but didn't know it?  If they just thought everyone was ignoring them?  How would other people react if they thought the person was ignoring them?  This works the same way, but with Mindspeak.  The victim has no knowledge they have been blocked.  The victim loses all ability to Mindspeak.  You must posses at least a level 1 lore of the victims breed and know for a fact that they are of that breed before this may be used.<I><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will+Basic Medical Skill vs TN 24 / Instant; takes 2 rounds per point healed to use this mastery.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The Psychic ability to heal through the placement of hands over the injured part of the body.  The hands usually grow very warm.  In some instances, the healer exhibits the wounds or symptoms of the disease or wound, until they sleep it off.  This mastery can be used to heal wounds during combat, however, the player's actions for the necessary number of rounds (see above) is the "laying on hands".  If successful, the target will regain 1 Body point per point over 24.  For every 2 points the target receives, the Psychic will receive 1 Mind damage as the healing drains his mental faculties.  This mastery can only be used on another person, the Psychic cannot perform it on themselves.  If the Psychic takes another action during combat, before duration is over, healing has stopped.  The TN is 20 if used with the Major Medical Skill.  <BR>

It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, not highest.  The psychic can only enact this mastery once per scene.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> A few Psychics have found another way to use mindspeak.  By increasing the telepathic flow toward a subject, they can over load their mind.  If this is kept up, or if it is powerful enough, then the target may eventually fall unconscious.  This buildup causes intense feedback, like white noise dealing 5 points of Mind damage.  Due to the great mental force and Psychic energy put into the attack, a Psychic may not perform any masteries the round following a Mental Blast.  The victim must be within line of sight.<BR>

The psychic may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The psychic may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  They are only a spectator.  The psychic may ask 3 questions in an instant message of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed. <BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene + ; takes 1 round to shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Though a psychic is essentially human, their extreme mental prowess have given them powers beyond that of a mere mortal.  By focusing on their mental energy and tapping into their internal strength, the psychic's true powers will emerge.  When the psychic taps into its Psychical, the severe concentration involved forces veins to flare up on their head and the soft tissue around their skull puffs up to approximately three inches.  Anyone with Lore Level 3 has an opportunity to recognize these changes in the psychic (as per the Lore rules).  While under this mastery, the psychic gains +2 Mind and +1 Soul for the duration, which is Scene.  If the psychic spends an additional Soul point, they can keep this mastery tapped and change scenes without dropping it.  This Scene swapping can continue as long as the psychic has Soul to spend.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By focusing his energies on a specific object, the Psychic is able to manipulate it on an atomic level.  Through this practice, the Psychic can cause the atoms of nonliving objects to speed up at an amazing speed, generating intense heat, and causes a highly combustible material (i.e. gasoline) to catch fire.  The target need only be within sight to use this mastery.  The object will catch fire, or begin to turn to cinder, or melt.  If metal is heated, it will cause 2 points of Body damage to anyone who comes in contact with it.  After 2 rounds after the object was heated, the metal can be touched again without harm.  The material must be stated prior to this mastery being used.  Any material may be used, however, there must be a direct line of sight to the material.  You would not be able to set a gas tank ablaze, simply because you cannot see the gas. Bullets (if the gun itself is heated) or other explosives heated in this manner will explode causing the normal damage +2 to anyone holding the item.  <I><BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> By reaching out with its mind, a psychic can detect its surroundings without using any of the normal five senses.  With this ability, they can effectively "see" in a 360 degree radius and can see through any form of hiding mastery (i.e. Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, etc.).  This mastery only works within a 50 foot radius outside or a single room inside.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN (see below) / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By concentrating on an object for a few moments, the psychic is able to focus his inner strength, lifting and moving the object.  The difficulty of such feats depends on the object being lifted.  Objects may only be lifted and moved.  Guns cannot be made to fire with only the mind, however, you could "summon" the gun to your hand, and then fire.  The player may move any object about.  There is not enough control to use this to attack someone.  For example, with a knife.  The distance moved per round is 10 yards.  TN's are:  For every ten pounds (rounded up) the object weighs, increase the difficulty by one from a base of 10.  Thus a 15 pound object would require a TN of 11, while a 260 pound object would require a TN of 35.  If they Psychic attempt to pick up a living...or undead creature, the roll will be vs. the victims 2d6+Will.  If the target 'wants' to be lifted or moved, then the roll is based on the targets weight.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> 2d6+Will vs TN 28/ Instantaneous: See Description<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics are sometimes referred to as "benders or reality".  Immutable laws of physics do not apply to them, as they can change at will, or what seems to be at will, most basic law of nature.  By reaching out with their minds, the psychic grabs hold of a temporal bubble and steps out of the normal flow of time.  For those that witness this odd phenomenon, the psychic seems to ripple briefly, then "pop" out of existence, as if the psychic never was there.  From the psychic's perspective, they have effectively pushed themselves forward in time so they can witness how events will have transpired a round (or 30 seconds) in the future.  They basically 'leap' forward that amount of time and can spend the mastery duration performing their action.  The psychic cannot reappear within another object or character.  Everything that the Psychic sees is frozen in time:  people are effectively statues, birds float in midair, leaves cease their rustling, bullets freeze, etc.  The psychic is the only person affected by Touch Time, regardless of whether or not he was in contact with anyone else upon activation of this mastery.<BR>
   Once activated, the psychic is immediately removed from the situation, be it combat or main room role-play.  For the next 1 round/ 30 seconds, the psychic is free to do anything he normally can do, save for using a mastery upon other characters or damaging anything or anyone in "real time". </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The psychic's time spent in the temporal bubble can be spent using skills or masteries upon himself, or used to change locations <i.e. running away>.<BR>
   When the time comes for the psychic to end their jaunt into time, they "pop" back into the normal flow on their initiative, if in combat, and fully able to take action.  All onlookers will see is a short warping of the air, as though it were elastic, then the psychic is standing in that spot.<BR>
           Should the Psychic attempt Touch Time more than one time per evening, an additional +2 to the TN will be assessed.  This is cumulative.  This mastery may only be attempted every other round.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The Psychic sends out mental impulses that disrupt the equilibrium of a target, throwing them off balance and rendering them unable to concentrate.  While under the dizzying effects of Vertigo, movement for the victim is slowed and difficult.  The victim cannot use any masteries which require any amount of concentration (mental masteries).  The victim receives a penalty of -4 to all physical rolls.  Eye contact must be established in order for this mastery to take effect, though once the victim is affected eye contact is no longer needed to continue the effect.  The Psychic must continue to concentrate to keep this mastery in effect.  They may not do anything other than move at a normal, walking pace, they may not enact any other masteries, but they can speak.  If they break these rules, the effects of this mastery immediately end.<BR>
