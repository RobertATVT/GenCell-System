What your character is right now, we would call a mortal.  Mortals are just like you and I.  The world your character lives in, however, has its subtle differences.  The creatures of folklore are not myths.  With any luck, they might leave you alone, but don't count on it.  If one of them happens to curse you with their gifts, you will immediately loose all of your current masteries and special abilities (you may keep the skill levels from the Gift, but lose Phenom, for instance).  Also, if the new breed has a mastery that you have already purchased under another breed, you may keep them.  In return, you gain the temptation of the breeds power.  This includes changes to your statistics and the new special abilities.  All of these are listed below.  You must have had an approved character sheet for 30 days before you can change breeds.  You may not change breeds more than once in one update and you may not update your character sheet more than once in a 30 day period.<BR>

Now say a resilient Vampire resisted the hallucinogenic effects of your character's blood long enough to sire your character.  Statistic wise on your CS you would remove the previous bonus to set your Statistics back to 5, 5, 5 first then add the Vampire breed bonus making your final statistics 6, 7, 4.
