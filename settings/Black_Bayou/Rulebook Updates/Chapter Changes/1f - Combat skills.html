</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Following is a description of the skills a character might use in just about any stressful or violent situation.  The Statistic in parenthesis (after the name of the skill) represents the abilities you use to perform that skill.  You may not raise your skill higher than the statistic listed in parenthesis.  <BR>
<BR>
Please note, if your character does not possess a skill below, they may still attempt the action.  In this case, the player will use the same roll listed with the skill, without the benefit of the skill level called for in the roll.  2d6+Attack instead of 2d6+Attack+Small Arms, for instance.  <BR>
<BR>
For rolls based on a statistic (there is a Stat in the roll) or on a modifier affected by a statistic, you must use the current rating in the roll.  For example: If your Body was 5 and you take 3 points of damage, you would have 2 Body left.  Then, if you attempted a skill and had to add your Body to the roll, you would only add 2 unless you are healed.<BR>
<BR>
You may notice that the offensive skill descriptions are fairly broad in their descriptions.  We did this to allow you the most creative freedom possible.  The term - Melee - refers to hand-to-hand combat with one or more opponents.  We are always accepting new ideas for skills and if you feel you'd like to make any suggestions, please send them to <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMail?subject=Rulebook Suggestion">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> Please remember that we cannot use every suggestion sent to us.<BR>

<B>Description: </B> Combat does not always have to result in death.  Many people carry personal self-defense devices such as tasers, pepper spray, mace, etc.  These weapons work to incapacitate a foe, with varying effects depending on the weapon used.  See the examples below for ideas.  The Storyteller has the final say in the exact effects of these weapons.  These weapons can be hidden is a pocket or larger type of cover.<BR>
   <B>Taser:</B> This is a small, handheld device capable of delivering electric pulses that can temporarily disrupt an opponent's central nervous system.  Enough damage will shock the victim into unconsciousness.<BR>
   <B>Pepper Spray and Mace: </B>These are chemicals usually contained in a small canister.  When a victim is sprayed in the face with these vile weapons, they will immediately experience severe pain.  Both chemicals blind the victim as they burn the skin and eyes.  The severity will depend on the total amount of damage done at the time.  The victim will usually fall to the ground, screaming, and covering their burning face with their hands.  With enough damage, the victim will fall unconscious due to shock.<BR>

<B>System: </B>Normal ranged attack<BR>
<B>Description: </B>Those individuals who are highly trained with ranged weapons gain a certain amount benefits from their increased knowledge.  Also, Federal Agents are taught not to fire their weapons unless they intend to kill their target.  Both circumstances take form in the skill, Sure Shot.  For each level of Sure Shot possessed, the firing character has +1 to hit a specific target or hit location.  Although aiming is still required (and takes 1 round before the shot is fired), the character may negate the normal penalties for a called shot and at the highest levels may be able to gain a bonus to this type of attack.<BR>
