</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Black Bayou is what we call a role-playing game.  A role-playing game is spawned from the imagination.  It becomes a world of its own with the characters the players bring to life.  This is not a "game" as many would see it.  There are no set definitions of winners or losers.  This game is about spinning tales and telling stories.  As the player in Black Bayou, you tell a story by assuming the role of a character you create.  The thing that puts the lives of your characters in your ultimate control in this immense play is the lack of lines.  These are stories of life, love, loss and death.  Tales of heroism in the face of great adversity and stories of decimation and entropy.  The stories are for you to begin and Fate to end.  You create the character, you write the lines, you tell the story.  <BR>
<BR>
The stories we tell have a dark tinge to them.  This is also a game of Horror and this genre thrives in the darkness.  In it's horror, we can also find myth and lore and the darkness they bring.  We play in a world that is based on these myths and they play a heavy role in the scenes around your character.  Business seems savage and cut throat; the government is truly as dark and manipulating as everyone thinks; the police are half corrupt and under funded; vampires prey on the weak by night and werewolves roam the countryside searching for something they can never truly find.. peace.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></I>To aid you in the telling of your stories, we have provided a set of rules for all to use.  These rules have been in development for over three years, yet they are forever evolving.  Input from the players always has its effects on the rules they all use.  You are always welcome to submit your input either through mail to <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMail?subject=Rules Question / Suggestion">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>or by posting to the Message Boards.  These rules are primarily here to resolve arguments that often arise when trying to play in a Free Form (or rule-less) forum.  They are used as a guide and the Black Bayou staff can help answer any questions you might have.<BR>
<BR>
You should take this opportunity to scan through the Rulebook.  You don't have to memorize it or even read it all right away.  Just try to gain a basic understanding of the world and of what your character can do.  The rule book is conveniently located in the Black Bayou main boards and is easily navigated using either the Table of Contents or the menu selections.  If you save the most common pages (such as the Combat page) to your Favorite Places, you will be able to access them quickly while you play.  Be sure to read through the rules in the Getting Started section so you'll learn the technical aspects of creating your own character.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

The players decide what the actions their own characters take while the Storytellers describe the actions of everyone else in the Bayou.  Storytellers are also available to be referees during fights or during scenes where a witnessed dice roll is required.  They have been dubbed in the past as, "The impartial observer; the hand of fate".</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Throughout the rules, you will find references which say things like, "2d6+Will," as a mere example.  2d6 is a universal role-playing game abbreviation meaning, "roll 2 six-sided dice".  Don't let this scare you, rolling dice online is much easier than you might think.  America Online has provided a convenient command for rolling dice in the chat room.  On an open line, you type: //roll.  It's that easy. You may prefer to use <B>Keyword:</B>  <A HREF="aol://1722:Dice">Dice</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.  When reading the rules, you will also encounter phrases such as, "roll 2d6+Will+Weapon Skill".  These are handled by rolling 2d6.  You take the result of the roll and add the listed statistic or modifier for a grand total (see Character Creation for more information).</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>In an offline role-playing game, the players verbally describe their character's actions.  The same can be said for online role-playing except that we type the our character's actions and comments.  We have a series of codes that we use while playing in the room to signify certain types of action and speech as well as where our characters are located should they be outside the nightclub, The Symposium, which serves as the main scene of the game.<BR>
<BR>
As everyone knows, Black Bayou is a text-based role-playing game. This means that you read what everyone else is doing, and then you type your response to their actions. Now, there comes a point when typing and / or reading skills play a definite roll in the outcome of an RP'd scene. This especially becomes an issue when one persons typing skills so outclass another persons, that it causes a major disadvantage for the less experienced typist.  As a general rule of RP Etiquette, each player involved should take turns in performing actions and/or responding to a conversation. Consider RPing to be broken up into rounds just like combat is. You state your action, then give the other RPers an opportunity to state theirs as well. If possible, limit your RP to 30 second actions. Think of how much your character can do in 30 seconds, and send that in one group of lines, then give the other player a good 2, maybe even 3 minutes to get their actions out. This ensures that the RPing is performed fairly and all characters involved in the scene have a chance to react.  In most situations, this causes nothing more than confusion in the scene being played. However, this can become an extremely unfair advantage in cases such as when the use of "non-combat" masteries and skills where one player is attempting to get in 3 or 4 actions against another character without allowing that other character to react. If such an abuse occurs, the character who was not allowed to respond properly to the actions going on has the right to send a log of the event to BBST Mail. It would then be decided if the scene needs to be overturned, or if it will be allowed anyway.<BR>
<BR>
When you wish your character to take an action, you simply describe the actions in as much or as little detail as you desire.  You then enclose the action in double colons.  For instance:<BR>
<BR>
<B>ANTMemnoch:</B>    ::walks out from behind the shed and begins to quietly creep up behind the officer.  Davis is still faced away from him::<BR>
<B>Davis Mason:</B>      ::scans the immediate area in front of him, the beam of the mag light illuminating the area like rays from the sun.  Unable to find anything amiss, he turns.::<BR>
<BR>
When you would like your character to speak to another, you simply type the spoken text normally.  You may occasionally wish to mix actions with spoken text.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ANTMemnoch:</B>    ::mutters dryly:: What brings you to these parts.. *officer*? ::emphasizing the final word with obvious distaste::<BR>
<B>Davis Mason:</B>    ::startled, he quickly turns to face the unexpected voice.  Stumbling back, he raises the light to shine in the face of Memnoch, taking in his features, sizing him up.:: I.. uhh.. ::he smiles:: visiting a friend.<BR>
<B>Davis Mason:</B>     ::his right hand resting comfortably on the familiar handle of his Baretta::<BR>
<BR>
Many of the supernatural characters in the game are gifted with the ability to speak with their mind.  We call this ability Mindspeak and have a special way to indicate when we use it.  Enclosing the text in brackets (>> <<) helps others to know that if their name isn't in the field, they do not hear it.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ANTMemnoch:</B>    ::by his abilities, Memnoch can easily tell that Davis is not mortal.  Knowing Davis then understands mindspeak, decides to keep the conversation silent::<BR>
<B>ANTMemnoch:</B>     >>(Davis Mason) ::Memmy growls menacingly with his thoughts:: whatever you do, don't look behind you..<<<BR>
<B>Davis Mason:</B>     ::shocked by the warning, not knowing if the man in front of him is actually friend or foe, but instantly realizing he was more than he appeared, Davis decides to risk it and quickly looks back::<BR>
<BR>
There are times when we'd like our character to either take action against another or attempt to do something that involves the hand of fate.  There are several ways of handling this.<BR>
<BR>
When you wish your character to take an action that directly involves a character, you can first gain their consent.  Many players would rather resolve a dispute through role-playing.  That is to say they'd rather not disrupt their role-playing with dice rolls.  If this is the case, then as players you should respect the wishes of the other and follow each other's rules about character injury and death.<BR>
<BR>
Alternatively, the situation may be resolved with the use of dice rolling.  This is where the Character Sheet you will later create comes into play.  At this point you may wish to find a Storyteller to help judge the contest or you could all decide to go at it by yourselves.  For a simple, one roll action (using a mastery, for instance) you can remain in the main play room.  These simple rolls do not really disrupt the role-playing that much.  However, if your scene will require multiple die rolls, we ask you to please meet in a Private Room so that you do not disrupt the other players.  For more information about combat and taking other actions, please see the Combat chapter.<BR>
