</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">When you wrote your character's background, you began to understand how you'd expect your character to turn out as a living (or undead) being.  The next few steps of the character creation process involve detailing the technical aspects of your character.  The Character Sheet (CS) is what we use to measure our character's physical, mental and spiritual selves.  We use numbers to signify their strengths and weaknesses.  The character sheets are then used to aid us in fairly determining whether or not our characters are successful in attempting certain actions: combat, masteries, etc..<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Selecting a Breed</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
You've probably already decided what Breed you'd like your character to be.  This selection is a bit more limited that most others are.  New players must begin as Mortals for the first month their characters are in play.  The Mortal is the easiest breed to play while learning the game since they so closely resemble us.  After you've had an approved Mortal character sheet for one month, you may opt for a change of breed.  The breeds you may then choose from are Psychics, Lamia, Vampires or Werewolves.  The Angels and Demons of Black Bayou are a rare and special duo.  In order for your character to become an Angel or Demon, you must have been playing a mortal, Psychic or Lamia and gain approval for the change by the <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMAIL?subject=ATTN Forum Director">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The following chart best shows what your changing options are depending on your character's current breed.  Only 2 breed changes may occur throughout a character's existence.  There are no exceptions to this rule.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Current Breed</B></U>	<B><U>May Change To:</B></U><BR>
Mortal			Psychic, Lamia, Vampire, Werewolf, Angel or Demon<BR>
Psychic		Mortal, Vampire, Werewolf, Angel or Demon<BR>
Lamia			Mortal, Vampire, Werewolf, Angel or Demon<BR>

Werewolf		Mortal, Angel, Demon <B>(Only with an Approved Storyline!)</B><BR>
Angel			Mortal<BR>
Demon			Mortal<BR>
<BR>
Once your character's breed is determined, you'll need a copy of the character sheet best suited to your character's needs.  Simply select the CS for the breed you'll be playing.  When the text appears on your screen you should cut and paste it to a new window so you can begin filling in the blanks.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>*Cut and Paste</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Simply highlight the CS text by left-clicking the mouse at the top of the text.  While holding down the left button, drag your mouse down until the entire text is highlighted.  Then, left-click Edit on the AOL tool bar at the top left of your screen.  After that, you just left-click Copy.  This will copy the highlighted text to the Windows Clipboard.  Now, you'll want to left-click File on the AOL tool bar just left of the Edit command you were just at.  Select New from the dropdown menu.  This creates a blank page for you to work your character sheet on.  Simply activate the cursor in the new window by left clicking in the body of the page.  Then, go back and left-click on Edit again.  This time, left-click on Paste.  This should fill the new window with the blank character sheet.  When you've finished the filling in the sheet, simply follow this procedure to submit it.  The only difference is you Paste the completed CS to an Email message addressed to <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMail">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.<BR>

The first section of the character sheet is for the personal information of your character.  They are fairly self-explanatory.  However, you will find a brief explanation of each section below.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Player's Screen Name:</B> This is the screen name you will be using while you play your character.  Preferably your character's name.  This is not a requirement, however.  You may only have one character sheet per screen name and only one screen name per character sheet.  If you wish to change your player screen name or use more than one screen name, you must send a request to <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMail?subject=SN Change">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>prior to using them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Character's Real Name:</B> This is where you put your character's full name.  The name of your character can be anything that best suits them.  From a normal name to a street or "nick" name.  Whatever others would call them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Date of Character Creation:</B> This is the date you submit your character sheet.  (First sent it to LDRS ANT BB Mail).  We use this to keep track of how long your character has been in the game.  This date will not change.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Date of Breed Creation (On Non-Mortal CSs)</B>: This is the date your character was no longer mortal.  If you do not begin the game as a Mortal, this would be the same as the Date of Character Creation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Date of Last Update:</B> Later on, as you've begun to play awhile, you will be able to spend Experience Points (XP) you'll earn to increase your character's abilities.  This listing will display the last date your character sheet was submitted after you've spent some experience points.<BR>
<BR>
Please keep in mind that we only keep character sheets on file that are 2 months or newer.  That means you must update your character sheet at least once every 2 months or it might get deleted.  If you are saving your experience points, just state that in the title of your Email.  If you are not going to be here over that two-month time, simply write</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMail?subject=CS Update">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>and we will be sure to set your character sheet aside until you return.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Statistics</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
The next step to creating your character is to choose their statistics.  Statistics are the way we measure our character's physical, mental and spiritual aspects.  These three statistics, together represent the core of our character's being.  All other entries on the character sheet have their foundations based on these three statistics.  The statistics are:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Body</B> is the physical aspect of your character.  It represents your character's strength, agility and resilience.  Body is used for many different things.  Any die roll that requires your character act physically is affected by their body statistic.  Running, throwing, attacking, dodging and many other physical actions are included.  It also determines how much physical punishment your character can sustain before they are rendered unconscious or dead.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mind</B> is the mental aspect of your character.  It represents your character's speed of thought, general knowledge and their capacity for reason.  Mind is used for many different things.  Any die roll that requires your character to think, reason or otherwise exercise their mind is affected by their mind statistic.  This includes, but is not limited to the use of many Masteries, solving logic problems or using skills that require the character to think.  It also determines how much mental punishment your character can sustain before they fall unconscious.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Soul</B> is the spiritual aspect of your character.  It represents your character's strength of the spirit and mystical energy.  Any die roll that requires the use of a character's inner strength is affected by the soul statistic.  Examples are:  a showing of great faith, resisting an addiction, etc..  Soul also determines how many times per night a character may use their Masteries.  Each mastery has a soul cost listed in its description.  Each time a mastery is used, this cost is subtracted from the character's soul statistic.  When this statistic reaches zero, the character is unable to harness the energies required to fuel the mastery.  Soul is recovered when you stop playing your character for the evening.  Once your character's Soul has been recovered, you may not play that character again until the following evening.<BR>
<BR>
You have 15 points with which to purchase point of statistics with.  These points may be divided any way you wish between the three statistics, however you must put at least 3 points in each.  <BR>
<BR>
A completely character in Black Bayou would have a score of 5 in each statistic, adding up to 15.  But you may decide that your character is not quite as strong as everyone else, and a little more intelligent.  In that case, you might make these scores 3 Body, 7 Mind, and 5 Soul.  The three numbers, regardless of where you put them will always add up to 15 when you create your character.<BR>
<B><U><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></U>Modifiers</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>The next section on the character sheet is where the modifiers are listed.  These modifiers are used to alter your die rolls to reflect your individual character's chances to succeed at the action in question.  All modifiers are determined by adding two other numbers together.  These can be two statistics or a statistic and a skill (described below).  It all depends on the modifier.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Attack</B> is the modifier used when your character wishes to physically attack or otherwise strike at a specific target.  Whether it is a slap, punch, kick, knife slash, club bash, pistol shot or hunting rifle you use your character's attack modifier to hit the target.  To determine your character's Attack Modifier, add the character's Body and Mind statistic together.  This number is recorded next to Attack on the character sheet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Will</B> is the modifier used when your character wishes to exert control or manipulate the world around them.  It is also used to resist many of the masteries that someone may attempt to use on them.  To determine your character's Will Modifier, add the character's Mind and Soul statistics together.  This number is recorded next to Quickness on the character sheet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Quickness</B> is the modifier used when your character wishes to attempt an action quicker than normal.  It represents your character's physical and mental speed and reaction time.  It is most often used during combat or during other scenes where time is of the essence.  To determine your character's Quickness Modifier, add the character's Body and Soul statistic together.  This number is recorded next to Quickness on the character sheet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Initiative</B> is the modifier used at the beginning of each combat round.  The initiative roll helps determine the order the characters act in during a confrontational encounter.  The higher their initiative modifier, the better their chances of acting before the others.  To determine the character's Initiative Modifier, add the character's Quickness Modifier to the Level of their Reaction Skill (If applicable; see below).  This number is recorded next to Initiative on the character sheet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dodge</B> is the modifier used when the character attempts to evade the attack of another.  It involves a number of moves from a side step to ducking for cover.  A dodge roll takes place as an attack roll is made against the character.  To determine the character's Dodge Modifier, add the character's Quickness Modifier to the Level of their Evasion Skill (If applicable; see below).  This number is recorded next to Dodge on the character sheet.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Skills, Masteries and Occupational Training</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Throughout the lives of our characters, they have undoubtedly learned how to do this thing and that.  The next step is to determine exactly what you character knows how to do at the time they join the story.  When you create your character, you are allowed to spend 40 points (Generation Points) to purchase your character's starting Skills, Masteries and Occupational Training.  Beside the description of individual skills, masteries and occupational training types, you'll find two separate costs.  The first is listed as a Generation Cost and the second is Experience Point Cost.  While spending your 40 Generation Points, you use the cost listed as the Generation Cost.  Later on, you will be introduced to Experience Points and Experience Point Costs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Skills</B> represent the talents and traits you character has either learned through a teacher or picked up as a necessity of life.  There are many types of skills your character already knows or could learn: weapon skills, hand-to-hand fighting skills, technical skills, social skills and many others.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Sample Skill Listing:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
<B>Skill Name (Stat) Damage:</B> How much damage the skill causes, if any.<BR>
<B>Generation Cost:</B> each point listed costs 1 point at character generation.<BR>
<B>Experience Point Cost:</B> each level of the skill costs this number of experience points.<BR>
<B>System:</B> This is the dice roll you make when attempting to use a skill and the target number required for the character to succeed with the action.<BR>
<B>Description:</B> This, naturally, is what the skill does.<BR>
<BR>
Skills are rated by levels.  Each level in a sill represents a little more knowledge or aptitude than the proceeding one.  Skill levels of 1-4 are considered beginners.  5-8 would symbolize intermediate while 9 and above would be viewed as quite talented.<BR>
<BR>
Each skill requires the use of one specific statistic.  This statistic is listed to the right of the skill's name in parenthesis.  The skill level may never be a higher number than the statistic listed in parenthesis.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Masteries</B> are the "supernatural" abilities unique to each breed that the characters may already know or may learn.  Even mortals have that little something about them that sets them apart from the rest of the breeds.  Every breed has a set of Special Abilities they begin to play with.  These are listed in each individual breed description.  There are other, less common abilities that each breed may possess and these "masteries" must be purchased separately.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Sample Mastery Listing:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
<B>Mastery Name Soul Cost per use (room command for activation)</B><BR>
<B>Mastery point cost at Generation/Mastery cost with Experience Points</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> The roll required to activate the mastery and the target number needed for the character to succeed/how long the effects of the masteries last.  The role-played effects of certain masteries can last a lot longer than the combat effects.  Also listed here is the number of rounds it takes to activate the mastery.  <BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time your character tries to use a mastery, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed.  You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Occupational Training</B> types are general groups of skills with special advantages that reflect what it might be like to have a specific job.  Each training type offers certain advantages bestowed upon your character as they learn how to perform their selected career.  Just like real life, there are often opportunities made available in time for your character to change careers.  Please keep in mind that just because your character knows how to perform a certain hob does not mean they actually have the job in character.  You may need to seek out certain individuals to actually obtain the job of your character.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Sample Occupational Training Listing:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
<B>Occupation Training Name</B><BR>
<B>Training cost at Generation/Training cost with Experience Points</B><BR>
<B>An in-character description of the occupation itself.</B><BR>
<B>Bonus Skills Level    Skill Costs</B><BR>
Bonus Skills are the skill your character automatically gains if you purchase the occupation during character generation.  Level represents the level you receive these bonus skills at.  Skill Costs represent the lowered cost for the listed skills you may purchase with experience points later on.<BR>
<B>Advantage:</B> This is an additional in-character advantage your character receives while they are in their current occupation.  Should your character ever lose their job they will loose these advantages?  If your character changes careers, they will lose their current advantage and take the advantage of the new career.<BR>
<BR>
We realize that not all of the possible occupations are listed here.  The list of occupational training is constantly evolving.  If there is an occupational training type you would like to see added to the list, send the idea to BBSTMail.  We will review it and if it is feasible or not covered by another occupational training type, we will work with you to provide something for you.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Target Numbers</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
When your character attempts an action that requires a die roll, there must be a means of knowing whether or not they succeed.  This is the purpose of a target number.  Many skills, masteries and other rolls will have a target number listed in the description of the die roll.  When you make the die roll, if the total result (a combination of the die roll and any other additions to it either from statistics, modifiers or skills) is equal to or exceeds the target number, your character succeeds in the action.  If this total falls short of the target number, your character fails in the attempt.<BR>
<B><I><BR>
</I>Note:</B> Should you roll double six's on any roll, regardless of the target number, you automatically succeed.  This allows for those rare instances where we occasionally accomplish something we normally wouldn't be able to.  This applies to combat as well.  As always, ties go to the defender.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>What It All Amounts To</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Once you reach this point, you are nearly finished.  All that remains are the finishing touches that polish off the work you've done.  The more detail you use when filling out these final sections, the better you'll understand your character and be able to accurately role-play them.  The final stages are:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Physical Description</B> is where you write up the actual description of your character's general appearance.  That is what they look like.  The clothes and styles they wear.  How they carry themselves and the first impression people generally get when they see your character.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Background</B> is the place you should write or cut and paste your background to.  In part one, we discussed writing your character's history.  This is the place to put it.  Simply write it here or cut and paste it. (see above) to this section of the character sheet.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Experience Point Record</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Throughout your character's journeys, they will undoubtedly learn new things about themselves and the world around them.  To symbolize this learning process, our characters earn experience points.  This is where you record the number of experience points you have earned since the last time your character sheet was updated.  Experience points are used to purchase Skills, Masteries and raise your character's Statistics.  The entries below should be filled out in detail each time you submit your character sheet.  This allows our Character Sheet Department to process your CS more efficiently.<BR>
<BR>
When you list your earned experience points, you must divide them into categories, dates and the amount.  There is a space for this information on the character sheet to make this easier.  For example:<BR>
<BR>
Roleplaying:		5 points			11/2, 11/5, 11/6, 11/9, 11/12<BR>
Posting		      	12 points		7-11/4, 3-11/11, 2-11/18<BR>
Above and Beyond 	5 points			11/12 (Awarded by BBST DaMan)<BR>
<BR>
<B>XP to Spend</B> is where you should record the total number of experience points you have to spend.  This is the number of points you have before you spend them.  You need to make a separate entry for each level of each skill or mastery you purchase for your character in the last part of the character sheet.  Even when you generate a new character, you must list where you spent each point.  These lists must be completed each time you submit your character sheet.  You must also list where each point you are claiming comes from.  Whether they be regular role-play, posting awards, etc.. If you do not do so, then there may be problems when we are checking for approval.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Remaining XP After Update</B> is the place to record the number of experience points left over after you have updated your sheet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Date of Update</B> is the date that you submit the character sheet for an update.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Where Spent</B> is where you should list the name of the skill, mastery or other update you have purchased.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Level</B> is used only for skills or masteries that use the level system. You should purchase the next level you purchased here.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Total Cost </B>is where you record how many experience points you spend on that specific skill level or mastery.<BR>
<BR>

After completing all of the steps above, you will have yourself a brand new, complete character sheet.  All that remains for you to do is send it in an Email message to the screen name to <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMail?subject=New Character Sheet">LDRS ANT BB Mail</A>.  Your character sheet will be promptly delivered to the mailbox of a Sheet Checker in the Character Sheet Department.  Sometime within the next 72 hours, you will receive Email confirmation that your character sheet has been approved.  If it is not approved for some reason, the Character Sheet Department will work with you on completing it correctly.<BR>
