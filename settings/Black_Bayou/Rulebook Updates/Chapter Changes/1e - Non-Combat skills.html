Following is a description of the skills a character might use in just about any situation.  The Statistic in parenthesis (after the name of the skill) represents the abilities you use to perform that skill.  You may not raise your skill higher than the statistic listed in parenthesis.  <BR>
<BR>
As you purchase your skills, it is important to realize a few things. There is a large difference between your characters CS and how they are RP'd. CS's and the majority of the rules are simply supplements to the RP in Black Bayou. However, the CS's and skills do represent a type of balancing between the characters. It is not necessary for the Player to be a certified MD in order for the character to have a medical skill. Granted, an in-depth knowledge of an area always makes RP more interesting, but it is not mandatory. The skills reflect what abilities the character possesses. On the flip-side, of course, the fact that you know a lot about an area, does not necessarily mean your character does. You could be a multimillion dollar lawyer in real life, but if your character does not have any law skills, when it comes to the courtroom your character does not know how to behave.<BR>
<BR>
Please note, if your character does not possess a skill below, they may still attempt the action.  In this case, the player will use the same roll listed with the skill, without the benefit of the skill level called for in the roll.  2d6+Body instead of 2d6+Body+Athletics, for instance.  <BR>
<BR>
For rolls based on a statistic (there is a Stat in the roll), you must use the current rating in the roll.  For example: If your Body was 5 and you take 3 points of damage, you would have 2 Body left.  Then, if you attempted a skill and had to add your Body to the roll, you would only add 2 until you heal.<BR>
<BR>
Your first attempt at any Non-Combat Skill roll is made normally.  If you roll again inside of an hour for the same thing, your roll will be at -1.  Roll again?  -2.  And so on and so on until that hour is up when the Skill roll will once again be made normally.  Remember that after the first attempt and the negative modifiers are added, automatic success with double sixes is no longer applicable until the hour is up and the Skill roll is once again made normally.  The only exception is the Luck Skill.<BR>
<BR>
<B>NOTE: </B>Unless otherwise specified or obvious, all Skill durations are 'scene'.  Such Skills include Fast Talk, Music, Theology, Tracking, etc. <BR>

Description:  </B>This encompasses the entire field of bartending.  Everything from making new drinks to being fancy about making them in general.  Tossing the bottles in the air while measuring the exact amount of alcohol is a great way to earn extra tips.  Bartenders are also known for their sympathetic ear and find it easy to get others to confide in them.  Bartenders are excellent at collecting information.<BR>

When a successful Basic Medical roll is made the patient receives 2 points of lost body.  This form of medical treatment may only be performed on the same patient once and only on the same night that specific injury was received.  Multiple uses have no effect, regardless of how many people try over how much time.  This skill may be used on any breed in their mortal forms.<BR>

You must purchase lore separately for each breed you wish your character to know about.  The exact descriptions of each level of lore is in the description for each individual breed.  To learn additional levels of breed Lore, you must have an in-character source of information about that particular breed.  When you become a new breed, you automatically gain level 1 in that breed's lore.  Breed Lore acquired during character generation must be explained in the character's background.  If your character does not possess the Breed Lore, then they do not know anything about the existence of the breed.<BR>

<B>System:</B> roll 2d6+Soul+Faith Skill Level<BR>
<B>Description:</B>  There are few things known to mankind that are more powerful than faith.  The faith in one's self; the faith in one's love; the faith in the world around us all.  Faith comes in many forms.  From the belief in a "higher power" to the belief in one's own "mystical" actions to the belief in one's own abilities.  Regardless of how it is justified, faith is a common ability of all forms of life.  We are all capable of knowing it and spend most of our lives searching for it, whether we realize it or not.  Of course, if we simply stopped looking, we'd discover we had it all along.  More specifically, however, faith is used in conjunction with lore when attempting to ward off or kill the unkillable.. the supernatural.  The system listed above is the standard roll for this powerful ability.  To find the specific target numbers, please look under the section of lore as detailed in the listing of the breed you wish to use it against. <BR>

<B>Description:</B>  The savior of drunk drivers and tool of salespeople everywhere.  A silver tongued individual finds it easy to convince others of nearly anything, depending on how well they beat their opponent's roll.  A character cannot be persuaded to do something that they'd never do, like give up a family heirloom, dance naked on a table, drop their gun after being shot.  Talking a cop out of giving a character a ticket is a prime example of this skill.  It is not mind control.  It is orally talking someone into something.  Only a Room Host, Storyteller or Game Master can decide how convinced a person is that the explosion of words is truth.  <BR>

<B>Description:</B>  Running a business is not easy.  Many things need to be considered and many different books must be kept.  Characters who run businesses must understand the basics behind running one and making money at it.  Finance rolls are allowed once a month and only when a Storyteller is present to witness the roll.  A roll is required whenever a business owner wishes to increase their income.  Other factors, such as using some of the computer skills, may slightly add to the Finance roll, the final say being up to the Storyteller.  No more than + 5 may be added to a Finance roll in this manner.<BR>

<B>System:</B> 2d6+Income Skill Level vs TN listed below.<BR>
<B>Description:</B>  Our capitalistic society insists we accumulate green colored paper with which to purchase goods and services.  Each level of Income represents the amount of money ($15k per level) your character earns in a year.  This money is not an exact figure the character owns.  Rather, it is the symbolic representation of what your character can and cannot afford.  Any time your character wishes to purchase something costing $500 or more, an Income roll is required.  A failed attempt only means your character did not have the means to purchase the item or service at that moment.  The target number increases depending on the cost of the item or services as listed below.  If an income roll is failed, it may be attempted again the next day.  <BR>

<B>System: </B>roll 2d6+Mind+Law Skill Level vs TN (see below)<B><BR>
Description: </B> Some people know the law and other know how to bend it.  A character that knows the law can attempt to weasel their way out of the situation.  This takes place in the courts since cops don't usually listen to slick talk of law.  "Tell it to the judge," they say.  If arrested and the character goes to court (in email), a Storyteller will be made available to witness the roll above.  If this roll is needed against more than one charge at a time, the player must roll for each charge.  Each charge after the first takes a cumulative -5 penalty.  Listed below is the level of each charge a character can be brought up on (their descriptions are listed in the Law Enforcement Chapter), with it's respective TN.  For every three points the player beats the TN by, the charge is dropped a level.  For instance, EricJohnsn is brought up on charge of attempted murder which is a 2nd degree felony (TN: 22).  Rolling 2d6+Mind+Law, he scores a total of 29.  He beat the target number by 7, which drops the charges by two.  He is instead found guilty of a Class A Misdemeanor.<BR>

<B>Experience Point Cost:</B> Next level x 4<BR>
<B>System:</B> roll 2d6+Mind+Major Medical Skill Level vs. TN 16 + 1 per Body damage taken by the patient<BR>
<B>Description:</B>  A select few have undertaken the specialized training necessary to be a surgeon.  These individuals are capable of almost any medical feat.  When a successful Major Medical roll is made for a patient, they will heal at x 2 their natural rate, over night.  Only one attempt may be made per night on the victim by anyone.  The x 2 effect only works for that one day.  That means the patient must be cared for every day to gain the full healing bonus until they are better.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the surgeon may attempt emergency life saving procedures if the victim has fallen to a negative Body total.  With a successful roll (same as the above), the surgeon can heal the victim to a Body of 1.  This counts as the one Major Medical roll for the patient per day, regardless of the doctor.  The victim, after being saved, is considered out of play for the rest of the night as they are hospitalized in that type of condition.  If the victim is 2 times their Body in the negative or worse, there is no chance of saving them.  For instance: Body of 4.  If their Body at the time of the emergency procedures was -6, it would still be possible to save them.  The target number would be 26 (16 + 10 damage), but it would still be possible.  If the same victim had a body of -9, they would be too far gone and would die.  The successful use of this skill does not counteract the killing effects of faith objects.<BR>

<B>Description:</B> The ability to compose and play music is not the easiest form of employment, but can certainly be satisfying to the individual.  The music skill itself is a rather broad skill, but musicians the world over have learned multitudes of instruments and most can play more than one.  In other words, if you own the Musician Occupation you do not have a limit on your instrument choice.  If you do not have this Occupation, you must choose one style of musical talent to strive for - writer or musician.  In parenthesis next to your Music Skill, list which type of music talent you are as well as what instrument you use, or the word 'writer'.  Success of a writing roll allows the character to write a musical piece that others enjoy and want to listen to.  Successfully making a play roll represents the characters ability to perform a musical composition well by utilizing voice or more mechanical instrument, not making mistakes, and generally impressing those who listen.<BR>

Characters may utilize this ability to create and handle stage flames and explosions as well as create suitable disguises.  While the effects of this skill can look harmful, damage is never incurred.  The target number varies, depending on the situation.  The Storyteller has the final say, but should follow this scale: small, flashy pyrotechnics / slight facial feature changes = 16; medium size explosive effects / drastic appearance change = 18; large explosive pyrotechnics / the most extensive changes to appearance = 20; huge explosive pyrotechnics / mimic the appearance of another = 30 (Note: You will not completely mimic another unless you achieve a TN of 30 with this skill and a TN of 30 with Acting)  With this skill no more than +/- 3 inches may be altered nor +/- 40 lbs in weight.

The target number is based on the type of terrain and how fast the target is moving.  For instance: If the target is running full speed through the woods, the target number would be 14; if the target was walking carefully through the swamp, the target number might be 20.  Having enhanced senses of any type decreases the target number by 4.  A Storyteller or Game Master has final say over the target number. <BR>

When writing a speech, for each roll 2 higher than TN 18, the player reading the speech gains 1 to their Fast Talk or Theology skill that night.  A person may only make one writing roll per night, working on the same story.<BR>

<B>Description: </B> With the importance of programming, the Engineer's job is often overlooked.  However, it's the hardware that enables the software to work, and it's the computer engineer's job to make sure that hardware is better than anyone else's.  Whether it's developing a faster processor or fitting more memory on a RAM chip, these are the guys who get the job done. This is the ability to create marketable hardware to be sold to the mass public.  You gain a bonus to this month's Finance roll, depending on how well you roll to build it.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#383430" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

The second use of this skill involves security and protection.  With this skill, your character can create hardware modifications to protect their own system or to sell to others.  When the engineer rolls 2d6 + Mind + Engineering, the result is compared to the chart below and the bonus given is added to the base target number for the type of the system the hardware is protecting  (see the description of the Hacker Skill for details).  Engineers who also know how to program systems themselves are able to put that knowledge to good use.  Characters with a programming skill equal or greater than their engineering skill may add those levels of programming to their engineering roll. <BR>

<B>Description:</B> The black sheep of the computer world.  Information is out there and these people want it.  Money, a clean slate, your cousin's birthday, these people maneuver their way around information the way you maneuver around in a car.  Knowledge is power, and they are taking all they can.  Those who have knowledge of programming computers gain a certain edge when they try to hack into another program or system.  They are capable of using that programming knowledge to assist with their hacking skills.  Characters with a hacking skill equal or greater than their programming skill may add those levels of programming to their hacking roll.  <BR>

Hacking may be attempted as many times as the character would like.  However, failure does have it's price.  If a character ever fails to hack a program or computer system in person (missing the Target Number by 10 points or more), they have either caused a malfunction or some other kind of permanent damage.  No further hacking attempts may be made for the rest of the evening on that program or system or until the program or system has been repaired.  Should a hacker fail a roll by 10 points or more on a remote system (i.e., hacking over the phone lines or into a network), then they have been caught.  Depending on the circumstances, they may be traced, physically discovered or suffer other consequences, which is all Storyteller discretion.  No further attempts may be made on that same system or network for the rest of the night.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Description:</B> Programs are everywhere and can do just about anything.  From artificial intelligence and calculating the next shuttle launch to making sure your digital watch keeps time.  Their purposes are about as wide and varied as the types of jobs people have.  However, using a program and getting it to work right are two very different things.  These people are the brains behind the.. well.. brains.  There are two purposes for using this skill.  The first is the ability to create a marketable program to be sold to the mass public.
