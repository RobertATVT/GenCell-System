1) ST BB Odin shadowed by HOST ANT Salem<BR>
2) 9:23-11:15 10/31/01<BR>
3) Victor A Martel, RichyRland, DarenDW, Chaz Storm, Dethsface<BR>
4) Victor picked up Christian's body and then intentionally walked out of the scene.<BR>
5) Victor disagreed with me on a number of points:<BR>
    1) That I ruled he could not enter dispas and carry Christian, on the grounds that    carrying a body is more strenuous than the targeting a specific body part and walking normal speed listed as RB criteria.<BR>
<BR>
    2) That I would not allow him to leap through a shade covered window with a body on his shoulder,  and continue running outside.</FONT></HTML>
