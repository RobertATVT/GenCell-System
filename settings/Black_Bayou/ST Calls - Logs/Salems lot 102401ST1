RichyRland: 	::Ponder:: Sooooo.....we can catchem, just as he flees?
Victor A Martel: 	But I will already have two rounds of escape ::nods::
Cage Towers: 	Technically no, you have to get out of the building first dude.
Victor A Martel: 	You can't do anything that arrival round, and then I get
away <g>  Thanks for playing.
Cage Towers: 	Unless we're taking that into account.
Daren DW: 	The first round we're there we can't attack.
HOST ANT Salem: 	((You can't escape until you have left the building)
Chaz Storm: 	If this is goingto be Vic 2 escape and is this far away then
they should finish tonight
Daren DW: 	Ohh.... that changes things Salem.
RichyRland: 	::Noddle:: One round...minimum to escape the building.
Cage Towers: 	Vic is standing over Chris who is at the stage, he's got to
find the office with the open window, or go out the way he came.
Daren DW: 	Didn't think of that, I'm sleepy, proof!
RichyRland: 	<g> One round to flee...we arrive. And have a shot at em.
Cage Towers: 	Either way, he can't do an escape until he's exited the
building.
Noah SIater: 	yeah he broke the locks on the door to keep everyone in and
can't go out that way withot busting it down
Cage Towers: 	And since he broke the door handles he'd have to take at least
2 rounds to get out of the building.
Daren DW: 	I thought vic was setting fire to the bar, and Christian's on the
stage?
Victor A Martel: 	Front windows, back windows... Victor 
Victor A Martel: 	did the security for this place... he 
RichyRland: 	2 rounds...we arrive, 2 rounds of fleeing, with us
shooting/casting/yelling.
Victor A Martel: 	knows where everything is in here <g>  
Victor A Martel: 	No searching...  back of the building... i
Victor A Martel: 	you guys couldn't catch him.
Victor A Martel: 	From the front of the building... 
The Trickster BB: 	Ok.  For all the dumb crap left to do in this
The Trickster BB: 	scene the call on when to redo stuf and who
The Trickster BB: 	does what you coulda finished this crap by
The Trickster BB: 	now
Victor A Martel: 	It will play out... but not tonight.
RichyRland: 	If I just spent the last 2 hours watching your boring RP for
nothing, I'm gonna be upset...
DethsFace: 	::Raises his hand again:: 
RichyRland: 	In fact, I'll proberably cry. A lot. ::Noddle:: You don't WANT
me to cry.
Victor A Martel: 	::chuckles:: Upset time <g>
ST BB Odin: 	Can we get on topic, please?
Daren DW: 	Okay, Odin, Salem, is there any possible way Victor could be
Daren DW: 	caught?  I.e. given his intent on actions, is it possible for
anyone to
Daren DW: 	stop him?
Victor A Martel: 	::throws him a box of tissues::
HOST ANT Salem: 	Christian?
Chaz Storm: 	Richy thats what happens when non cops get called in on scenes
::shrugs::
Victor A Martel: 	yeah... victor could trip while walking... 
Victor A Martel: 	oh wait.. that doesn't require a roll... 
Victor A Martel: 	shucks.
DethsFace: 	1) Didnt Vic come here after Noah? Shouldnt he be searching for 
DethsFace: 	him instead of deciding to run with the body of someone he hadnt 
DethsFace: 	encountered before hostily?
HOST ANT Salem: 	Yes, in fact he can
ST BB Odin: 	Salem is right. #1 Light Bar. #2 Free up both hands. #3 Grab
Chris. #4 Leave Building Then 2 rounds of escape.
HOST ANT Salem: 	I mean , he can be caught
Chaz Storm: 	For all the damn bitching hte scene could have been done if
people didn't take 
ST BB Odin: 	Richy and Daren arrive at turn 2, but cannot act until turn 3.
Chaz Storm: 	ten minutes for one like of action
Noah SIater: 	yeah as far as vic knows ic noah is still in the building
ST BB Odin: 	Chaz and Tricky arrive at #3 there.
ST BB Odin: 	So no, Vic is not uncatchable, if he does everything he meant to
do.
Daren DW: 	Like you pointed out chaz, rounds take a long time, we'd still be
on
Daren DW: 	the next round right now, hardly the 6 necessary.
Chaz Storm: 	without the extras like Richy and Aurora being brought in it may
have gone faster also
Victor A Martel: 	Ummm... nope.. Let's see... Pigs 
Victor A Martel: 	arrive... they don't have any magic 
Victor A Martel: 	homing beacon to know where he is... 
Victor A Martel: 	where will they go (knowing the OOC 
Victor A Martel: 	manip level it's blatant) but assuming 
Victor A Martel: 	they are all real roleplayers... front 
Victor A Martel: 	door... front door is locked there's 
Victor A Martel: 	three rounds.  Then they either have to 
Victor A Martel: 	find a way in or bust down the door... 
Victor A Martel: 	more rounds.
HOST ANT Salem: 	Most cops would go front and back.
Daren DW: 	With multiple officers.
Cage Towers: 	Uh police tactics involving multiple units puts one at the
front door and one at the back door...I live next door to a cop.
Victor A Martel: 	Face it... unless you OOC (Which of 
Victor A Martel: 	course you will)  Richy isn't a cop #1 
Victor A Martel: 	but that's irrelavent.
Daren DW: 	While there will be in 3 rounds.
ST BB Odin: 	Reasonably, they would surround the building. They may not have
a magic beacon, but they won't just go after a place.
Victor A Martel: 	You will staill have o take the three or more rounds to get
TO the back door.
Cage Towers: 	You can drive around a building in about 2 rounds if you're an
experienced driver.
DethsFace: 	OOC? Like you leaving new orleans and suddenly knowing where 
DethsFace: 	Noah was? How does that homing beacon work slick?
RichyRland: 	And as I run faster than you drive...<g?
Victor A Martel: 	The same time *I* had to take to get 
Victor A Martel: 	there.  In that time... I'm GONE.  Still 
Victor A Martel: 	two rounds in which I'm gone.
Victor A Martel: 	Works since I know that Noah used to 
Victor A Martel: 	hang out there from where I monitored 
Victor A Martel: 	security for MONTHS doc... like you 
Victor A Martel: 	suddenly poofing into the room to help 
Victor A Martel: 	your buddy there.
RichyRland: 	I hate STd scenes.
Cage Towers: 	In Deths deffense, he did punt. BUT THIS IS NOT THE POINT!!!
DethsFace: 	Um, I had been there since 11, thank you.
RichyRland: 	They're slow, and boring, and in the end, they turn into a
morass of people bitching
Daren DW: 	People ruin them sometime Richy.
ST BB Odin: 	(Look, it takes one person to pause a scene. Rather than argue
who is cheating, lets get some sleep? Argue who is cheating in a letter to
the OOC dept, not to all of us.)
HOST ANT Salem: 	As the ST here.. I happen to know that cops would surround
the building.. .
Cage Towers: 	The point is, with all this bickering, we could have completed
at least another round given the rate of type from some folks.
RichyRland: 	Everyones cheating! St BB Odin is cheating! let's blame it on
him...::Ponder:: or zion!
Chaz Storm: 	We could have done three rounds ::shrugs::  
RichyRland: 	We should blame Zion for everything.
Victor A Martel: 	But that still takes time, time in which I will have
already gotten away.
Chaz Storm: 	Chaz is frozen in this scene until next wed I think thats what
*you* all agreed on right?
Noah SIater: 	well if vic came for noah he would think he was still in the
building and it would be odd to pick up a body and take him out when that
wasn't his intent in the first place
RichyRland: 	Next wednesday. ::Noddle:: 9:30.
RichyRland: 	Is that okay?
Chaz Storm: 	Salem?
ST BB Odin: 	(I'm going to bed. Rather than talk, lets go to sleep? I have to
be up in a few hours. Wednesday the 31st, 9:30 seem good for everyone?)
Cage Towers: 	I'm just confused how someone would know the complete lay out
of a building including the employee's only area is all.
Victor A Martel: 	Right grab Christian, goto the office... 
Victor A Martel: 	no Noah, broken window... run time 
Victor A Martel: 	kids.. alert on the desk blinking... oops 
Victor A Martel: 	cops are coming.
Daren DW: 	Bottom line if the STs say we need to finish this then we need to
Daren DW: 	finish this, clear intent and end or not.
Noah SIater: 	office door is locked
Victor A Martel: 	Cause Victor did the security for this 
Victor A Martel: 	place it was his job at one point.  When 
Victor A Martel: 	did that happen?  Cara was standing in 
Victor A Martel: 	the door when walked over, no RP of a 
Victor A Martel: 	locked door... nice try.
Cage Towers: 	I did.
Victor A Martel: 	(Then walked over)
Noah SIater: 	cage rpd it in one of his rounds
DethsFace: 	Works for me. I'm going to bed. Somebody email me if it changes
from the 31st.
Chaz Storm: 	It was Rob
Cage Towers: 	I shut the door and locked it because I was telling Noah that
Cage wanted to date Cara, and Cage didn't want a random stripper bumping into
that convo.
The Trickster BB: 	G'night.
OnlineHost: 	DethsFace has left the room.
Cage Towers: 	Have a good one man.
HOST ANT Salem: 	 Okay.. This is done with.. I don't need to baby sit this...
I habe 3 kids here. I also have work in 5 hours and if this is all we are
going to do then.. You are all paused. please send in your times.
OnlineHost: 	The Trickster BB has left the room.
ST BB Odin: 	(Ok. I'm leaving as well. ST BB Odin Log Off, 3:44 AM October
25th)
Cage Towers: 	::raises a hand:: I'm not paused.
Daren DW: 	S;what I'm saying...
OnlineHost: 	Noah SIater has left the room.
Daren DW: 	g'night everyone!
Cage Towers: 	nighters
ST BB Odin: 	Nite!
OnlineHost: 	Daren DW has left the room.
