ST BB Odin: 	I've got the seven who are continuing on BL. So as long as they<BR>
aren't blocking me, I'll link them as they come<BR>
RichyRland: 	::Bounce:: Well....Hi!<BR>
OnlineHost: 	HOST ANT Salem has entered the room.<BR>
RichyRland: 	I'd like to mention that the holoween RP ismighty cool. :D<BR>
Chaz Storm: 	Its been good yes<BR>
HOST ANT Salem: 	There's Daren<BR>
Chaz Storm: 	Deths is on too<BR>
OnlineHost: 	Daren DW has entered the room.<BR>
HOST ANT Salem: 	Death, since his sheet is unconscious and will have no<BR>
action. Does not have to be here if he wishes not to be.<BR>
Victor A Martel: 	(I would like him to be here as things may occur that will<BR>
affect him)<BR>
ST BB Odin: 	I'd keep him here. He doesn't need to roll inits, but I remember<BR>
Gian's death at Syn's hands was undone because the roll was done without his<BR>
presence.<BR>
ST BB Odin: 	So I'd like to keep everything legal.<BR>
OnlineHost: 	DethsFace has entered the room.<BR>
Daren DW: 	Nah, Gian's roll was about other things, I was involved with that<BR>
one.<BR>
RichyRland: 	Hi christian. ::Waves:: Hey man...<BR>
RichyRland: 	sorry ya have to be here. :( ST'd scenes are no fun.<BR>
HOST ANT Salem: 	(( And it doesn't matter what happens There isn't anything<BR>
he can do about it, therefor no reason he has to be here. He's got Staff<BR>
related things he must tend to. ))<BR>
Daren DW: 	(( As long as we have his permission to go on without him it's<BR>
cool. ))<BR>
DethsFace: 	(I dont think so.)<BR>
Daren DW: 	(( Then we got a problem... ))<BR>
HOST ANT Salem: 	( Well, he's here now. So there is no problem. Odin.. lets<BR>
get this going. The sooner the better for Everyone))<BR>
ST BB Odin: 	(Isn't trickster still supposed to be here?)<BR>
RichyRland: 	(No.)<BR>
Chaz Storm: 	( he left the scene last week and hasn't been on the mailings)<BR>
Daren DW: 	(( I guess he got dropped... ))<BR>
