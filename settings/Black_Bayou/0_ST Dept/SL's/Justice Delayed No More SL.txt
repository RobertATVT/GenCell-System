<BR>
Greetings,<BR>
<BR>
Please Keep this Letter for your records.  Alright!  Everything looks good here.  Thank you for you thoroughness in getting everything together for this Death SL.  Whereas the log from Aton was not needed for your submission -- it still helps me put everything into prospective to see what exactly has been going on.<BR>
<BR>
The ST being assigned to this Death SL is HOST ANT Paradox, he will be included on mail strings concerning this SL.  If Paradox is not available to run the Death scene expected to come from this storyline, you are more than welcome to work with other STs - however - just to let you know if you stick with Paradox, he will have a firmer grasp on the situation at hand.  Please send <B>all </B>logs and posts that come from this SL to HOST ANT Aradia.<BR>
<BR>
I would like to see at least one post done that shows where preparations are being made to carry out this SL.  Where you do not have to name the target you are going after - I would like to see something posted up about how Rya begins gathering her forces together. : ) <BR>
<BR>
Any logs or posts that you put up concerning your SL should be linked or posted in the Mind Vault - Post Link folder so we can keep track of the A&B points that you will accumulate for this SL.  Here is a link to how logs and posts should be posted in that folder.  <A HREF="aol://5863:126/mB:444965:1">Welcome to The Mind Vault - Post Links!</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

1) Title of Storyline: Justice Delayed No More (Final Death SL for Aton Rya Boguard)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
2) Players involved (screen and character names): Rya Winter (Dpty Rya Winter), Alicia Monterey (same SN), Sebastian Dagenar (SDagenar), Damian Knight (Mr Damian Knight), Lex Martel (same SN), Aton Rya Boguard (same SN, victim--FINAL DEATH SL, DO NOT NOTIFY...thank you.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3) Summary (what you want to happen): <BR>
<BR>
Justice delayed, so the saying goes, is justice denied.  Rya recently found out from one of her pups, Jessica, that Aton Rya Boguard had abducted her, taken her to his cabin, and assaulted her, not allowing her to leave until she had sex with him.  (Log attached--no cyber involved).  She also found out just recently that Aton has been digging for information on Rya, and that Jess ended up caving in under pressure and telling him Rya was her alpha. <BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>She is also well aware that her Beta, Damian, has fought with Aton on a number of occasions.  Aton's assault of Jess is, for Rya, the last straw.  She recently re-forged her covenant with her pack, swearing to make certain that anyone who did them harm would pay the price.   <A HREF="aol://5863:126/mB:137711:55286">The Anvil and the Flame: Reforged (Rya)</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> Thus, she plans to kill Aton.  However, not certain that she can take him out alone, she intends to enlist a number of allies: Alicia Monterey, one of her pups, now an Alpha in her own right; Damian Knight, her Beta, who has killed for Rya before; Sebastian Dagenar, another Alpha with whom Rya is friends, whose skill as a hunter will help to make certain that Aton is truly dead, and Lex Martel, another wolf whose lore and power will help tip the battle in their favor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen): Rya will call Aton, asking him to meet her to talk to him alone at a spot in the woods (not her cabin, and NOT God's Head) about the hunters currently chasing werewolves in Voletta.  Using herself as bait, (and planning to cancel if he shows up with -anyone- else at all), the others will hide--in Dispas if they have it.  (Damian does; Lex does; not sure about Alicia; I think JD is getting it).  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Damian will take a called shot at Aton's heart, from Dispas</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>; <B>(not Damian will take a head shot at Aton using Sure Shot, from Dispas; can't use Sure Shot or Aiming in Dispas)</B>.  -5 Body if it hits, and it should stun him for a round, making it impossible for him to use MS, EMS, or Call the Pack, or to call for help using a cell phone or anything else.  The rest of the group will take their attacks after that.  If a round two comes up, Damian will again take a head shot to stun him, for another -5.  There will be the standard -2 cumulative penalty to Aton's dodge for the 5 multiple attackers atop the negative body for the head shots and other wounds inflicted, and hopefully there won't be a round 3.  After that, the Silver </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bullet </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>and Faith roll will be used to truly kill him, and the body will be completely incinerated and the ashes disposed of.<BR>
<B>(Not silver dagger.  Eesh.)</B><BR>
