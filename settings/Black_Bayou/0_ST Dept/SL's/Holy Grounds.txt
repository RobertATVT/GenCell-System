</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Bookman Old Style" LANG="0"><B>Congratulations! Your SL has been approved.  Your attachment shows that you are a demon by your current CS so that isn't a problem.  So this SL is for Holy Grounds and for the binding of NPC souls into tomes for your shop known as your children.  On the Holy Grounds issue, your income level is 5.  The current income level necessary to have a business in Voletta is 7.  In the next six months until your resubmission date it will be required for you to increase your income to level 7 and buy finance to level 4.  This will ensure that you have the income and finance to upkeep your shop and keep it in the black.  You have six months to do this and to show you are making the effort to increase these items.  You will be required to resubmit your SL in 6 months at the date given.  Congratulations again and please retain this approval for your records.<BR>

Heya!<BR>
<BR>
Here's my SL/BG as it was submitted to ANTLetjae back in '96 or so. <BR>
<BR>
In this -- my original BG and SL -- I was granted :<BR>
<BR>
1] My Demon status.  (( <I>A young [ for Demons, that is. ]  Succubi Child of Lucifer and Llith merged with a Mortal. ))<BR>
</I><BR>
2] My very own business.  (( <I>Holy Grounds, Coffe and Occult Shop, complete with all manner of haunted happenings. )) <BR>
</I><BR>
3] My purely *story-orientated* Necromancy/ Demon abilites.  (( "Drain NPC victims of their Life Force via [Sex] Feeding" -- "Mold the bodies of NPC victims into Tomes, and Bind the NPC victims souls into them to create Malcolm's Children" -- "<BR>
<BR>
4] A high level [ for that time in Black Bayou. ] of Income to establish I was wealthy beyond belief. <I>(( Granted because Malcolm is a best selling Author. ))</I><BR>
<BR>
Since that time a lot has changed, both in Malcolm's development as a character, and Black Bayou's development as a game. However, I would hope to retain all of the above mentioned items. However, since this was not actually submitted as a SL back then, I don't know how well it will write up as a SL now.<BR>

                     ~APPEARANCE / EQUIPMENT~<BR>
 IMAGE [1] Malcolm is a quite, unassuming Scotsman in his mid 30's - a rare breed indeed. A tall, lanky  man [6'0" -- 190lbs] he nonetheless is very robust, and enjoys hiking. He sports shoulder length auburn hair, and a fine beard etched along the line of his jaw. A moustache sprouts from under a sharp nose, upon which rests a pair of wire frame glasses. Thick glasses. He likes to dress in jeans and plaids, matched up with soft leather boots, if indoors, and working boots if outside.<BR>
 <BR>
 IMAGE [2] Malcolm is a loud, roaring Scotsman in his mid 30's. Wiry and fast [6'0" -- 190lbs] he enjoys womanizing, thrill seeking and studying the black arts. His shoulder length auburn hair is mostly unkempt, and his beard and moustache are often ragged. He has a pair of thick glasses, but he acts as though he doesn't need them. He dresses in torn jeans and off-color t-shirts, all black, as well as hard boots and matching belt.<BR>
 <BR>
                           ~BACKGROUND~<BR>
<BR>
      Born in the mid 1800's, the son of a Catholic priest, Malcolm learned early in life that there was a fine line between the "supernatural" and the "divine". His father preached only the latter; Malcolm developed a deep love for the former. As a child he explored the old catacombs under his fathers Church and discovered a Library of ancient magical texts. Studying these, he soon became a powerful Necromancer, but failed to actually do anything with it. He tried a stint in the Church, but failed that to. Combine all this with the usual problems of a wasted youth, and Malcolm soon found himself thrown out of his home to fend for himself. Cut off from his source of income, Malcolm soon dried out, and realized he would need a future very soon. Having filled his head with fantasy, occult and drugs, Malcolm decided to pursue the only lifestyle left open to him.<BR>
      He became a writer.<BR>
      Eventually, in a short span of time, he realized that he was as much a failure with this as he had been anything else in life. So, in desperation, he turned back to the Dark Arts. Using rituals he had found in the old tomes hidden away in his fathers Church's lost Library, he attempted to summon a Muse of the ancient Greeks into him.<BR>
      For inspiration, of course.<BR>
      It didn't work quite as he had planned.<BR>
      What he managed to summon was a Demoness, an Incubi/Succubi of sorts. Malcolm was indeed possessed of inspiration and drive now; fueled by an unholy passion. The Demoness agreed to help him write, if he helped it to "experience" life.<BR>
      Malcolm agreed, but tricked the Demoness. He locked it away into a magically prepared stone so he could retain control.<BR>
      In a short time, he became published. Over the years, his thirteen award winning novels of erotic occult/horror, called "The Long Night" series, ensured that the young Scotsman would never have to work seriously again. Still, his inner spirit wanted more. Writing was his drug now, and he was hooked.<BR>
      After the mid 19th century rolled around, he wrote another series of short stories, magazine articles and anthologies, not to mention all the while commiting a spate of rapes, murders and bungee jumping. Tired of it all, the now jaded Scotsman wanted only to settle down. Somewhere away from it all, especially his inner  companion, and work on his masterpiece book, "The Circle of Light".<BR>
      Yet everywhere he went, people recognized him . . . plus his darker half went with him. After a career spanning well over a century, he was unable to find the peace he so craved. Plus, life's little experiences were becoming jaded for the Demoness; it wanted more. It needed more.<BR>
      So he moved to America.<BR>
      Here, in the hustling town of Seattle, he discovered Coffee Shoppes, and developed a new addiction. He also met up with some people who were able to teach him new and exciting ways to lock down his inner self. He eagerly sought out all the ins and outs of the business, as well as studied whenever his companion was "asleep". Soon decided that he wanted to open an Occult/Bookstore/Coffee Shop of his own. However, Seattle had way to many to do well with another. Plus he had his friend to take care of.<BR>
      He soon found a place, deep in the south, where he could fulfill both of his dreams. A quiet place, hidden away in a bayou all it's own. An Isle of darkness and despair. There he would establish his store, and he would name it "Holy Grounds" as a barb to his Demoness companion, plus a reminder of his father. Miracilously, the old man was still alive -- his Demoness having used it's dark powers to keep the old man alive all these years. Once established, he hoped to be able to learn, and preform the necessary Wards and such to bind his inner demon, and to free him.<BR>
      Holy Grounds -- a new start for him.<BR>
      Or so he thought.<BR>
