<BR>
The Scent Rec and tracking was done by Jillian Craft in the conclusion log.  HOST ANT Templar was the host on duty for the 8-10 shift so that all should be covered in that log. <BR>
<BR>
Brief history on the two SLs.  (Hold your breath when you read through this, lack of oxygen might help understand the chaos below.)<BR>
<BR>
Beth's was done unto on <B>07/10</B>.  The damage and transportation is listed in the previous log from Dominic.  Tracking began on the <B>07/16</B> from Scent Rec Rolls and tracking rolls done by Talon.<BR>
<BR>
Once the approval for Voletta Trackers went through on<B> 07/20/00</B>.  VT was approved by HOST ANT Jello. <BR>
<BR>
Conflicting information was being given about Beth's whereabouts.  The reason behind the request for Beth's Buried was to assist Paradox with the STd parts of the SL for the completion of Voletta Trackers. HOST ANT Paradox and myself, requested an SL from Beth so a location and additional information could be locked down for when the VT SL was to be completed. <BR>
<BR>
The original submission for Beth Buried was sent to HOST ANT Numb <B>08/11/00 </B>and then pulled from Numb <B>08/18/00</B> because of computer problems he was having of not being able to access his mail. <BR>
<BR>
On <B>08/18/00</B> the SL was given to HOST ANT Wolfie.  The SL went through 2 Pendings.  On the first Pending sent <B>08/21/00, </B>Wolfie  listed out what corrections were needed for the SL .  On <B>08/29/00</B> the 2nd pending email was sent to Dominic for his input.  <BR>
<BR>
On <B>09/11/00</B> the Beth's Buried SL was sent to Paradox for him to review over for the final determination on location, and distance for Voletta Tracker completion.  Going by all information gathered from VT mastery and tracking rolls, and logs from both SLs - the determination of 250 miles outside of Voletta was made for Beth's location.<BR>
<BR>
There was only one discrepancy in the Approval from Paradox and that was the statement that the Trackers had been tracking daily.  I placed an Aradia note on the top of the approval sent through to AFD/FD that corrected that.  The averages given to find Beth were figured up at 5 miles per day at 60 days = 300 miles.  There is a ten day difference as to when she should have been located. (5 miles per day at 50 days = 250 miles).  This was noted on the approval sent for AFD/FD Approval with the simple statement that the Trackers had *not*  been tracking daily. <BR>
<BR>
On <B>09/12/00</B> the SL was sent out for AFD/FD approval. <BR>
<BR>
On<B> 09/13/00</B> I  received the first of the complaints being sent in from StGermain<BR>
<BR>
Did I loose you?  Believe me, I've been pulling my hair out since late July trying to get the players involved in Beth's Buried to help with their involvement in this dilemma.  In between the SL Department staff shuffling left and right and the lack of any sort of definite answer from Beth's Buried this entire plotline has become more complicated than what it should be.<BR>
<BR>
The completion of VT has resulted in Beth's discovery and retrieval.  Nothing more.  <BR>
<BR>
I've got all the records you need.  Just let me know what you want and I'll send them out.  Paradox has had involvement more with the STd sessions concerning both of theses SLs so more information can be gathered through him if need be.<BR>
<BR>
Cloud has requested a hold be placed on the two SLs until a resolution comes about.  I'll be handling that here in the next few minutes. <BR>
