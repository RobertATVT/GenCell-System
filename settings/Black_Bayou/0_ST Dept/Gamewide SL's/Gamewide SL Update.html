</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0">Pending any drastic change, the finale to the Game Wide SL will be  held on Friday, October 13th.  (full moon)<BR>
<BR>
I've not posted anything up on the Message Boards about it yet.  However, I will be doing so in the next few days.  <BR>
<BR>
The grand finale will involve the introduction of two new Breeds that are going to be play tested. I'd like to thank the Breed Department and Breed Committee that was set up to get these Breeds up and running.  <BR>
<BR>
We will be needing a number of Room Hosts and STs to be available for the (hopefully) four hour event that is to take place.  <B>Everyone </B>will get the chance to play in the game wide event.  If you are one of those Blessed people who volunteer to help out for one of the two shifts, you can look forward to being able to play in the other half of the Event.  :: knocks and wood, waves around her four left clover:: <BR>
<BR>
If you haven't had a chance to participate in the Game Wide Event, I encourage you to do so.  Over the last three weeks, the SL Department has taken volunteers and worked with players to RP out hunter attacks in the Main Room.  (Jason Nightshade, AngusMcVey,  S Dagenar)  I have two other players that I am waiting to hear back from on scheduling other attacks.  If you have a Demon, Vampire, Lamia or Psychic character that you would like to volunteer for a RPd shooting over the next three weeks, please contact me.  (Side note to Templar: <eg>  Why don't you just give me your host schedule in advance - seems like all the Hunters show up on your shifts anyway. <ducks>)<BR>
<BR>
Any questions?  Send them my way!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks folks! <BR>
