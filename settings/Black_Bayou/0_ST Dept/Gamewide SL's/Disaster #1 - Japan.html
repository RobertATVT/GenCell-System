News Report:  <B><I>Tokyo Nearly Leveld by Record Tsunami after effects.</B></I><BR>
<BR>
Today the inevitable happened.  Hundreds of thousands of Japanese have been killed by a record sized Tsunami that washed across lower Japan.  The resulting crash caused several inactive volcanoes to erupt and Tokyo suffered an Earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter Scale.  Chaos has ensued as rescue workers try to uncover the victims and survivors, all the while dodging pools of magma that have bubbled up from the faults below.  The total death report at this time is 359,134, and the number is growing.  Over one hundred thousand Japanese citizens have been reported missing so the search continues.<BR>

<I>During this disaster 3 Japanese Vampire Families will be taken out to a man.  The disasters are good covers for the hunters as they assist them in killing during the chaos.  These three families consist of:<BR>
<B></I>Sinji-Kuru: </B>This family has heavy ties in the Yakuza and has 36 Members.  The Father is Itsumi Sinji-Kuru, and he is the Oyabun of the Yakuza Family.

<B>Testuoshi:</B>  The Tetsuoshi line follows a more rigid Bushido style of life than the others, bound to loyalty and honor above anything, this line is easily the closest to 'good' that the japanese Families have in existance.  This family contains 43 members and acts more like a traditional Japanese family than any others.<BR>
<B>Atimuro:</B>  The Atimuro family is mainly comprised of younger vampires that took over one of the older families.  They are ruthless and care for nothing save their supremecy.  Most members of this family are thugs in nature and they have turned themselves into more of a motorcycle riding street gang than a real family.  The largest family in Japan at 58 members.</HTML>
