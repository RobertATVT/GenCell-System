Sulimark. Kazagroth. Damos.  Three Demon Lords who had come together with one purpose in mind.  To destroy the Protectorate stronghold in Brazil.  The base haven  had fallen months ago, but the three Demons have fought amongst one another for the spoils of war that had been left behind.   Forty followers, some demon spawn themselves, others dispicably dishorable mortals, all died at the hands of the Protectorate hunters who had returned with vengeance in their hearts.  <BR>
<BR>
Demon Hunter Saeed Majid, had cordinated the Hunters in the attack in Brazil - yet once infomation was learned that 2 other Demon Lords; Zyplex and Morgryn and were in Helsinki, the tireless Hunter was on a plane within the hour. Little over a half a day later he arrived. The team of Hunters waiting in Finland were briefed and  by the end of the 24 hour period 60 demons, including the ones in Brazil,  had fallen worldwide. <BR>

<BR>
Sudan, Central African Republic and Cameroon were engulfed in flames as an out of control border raid from Eritrea into Ethiopia fails.  The Protectorate, a not so nice branch of the Hunters, had managed to work their way into this War and a destructive attempt to destroy an encampment of soldiers (Angels) turned into a massive kill zone.  The fighting between the two groups caused fires to dot along the dry grasslands, and spread west into the three above mentioned countries.<BR>
<BR>
Four Arch Angels died in this massive destruction.  This supposedly inconsequential strip of land is actually the location that the body of Ramses was deposited upon centuries ago after he gave chase to Moses upon the parting of the Red Sea.  Cursed by God, the remains held about them an unholy taint that spread about the desert and has caused nothing but stride and strife for anyone or anything that has ever lived there. The Four Angels have been attempting to Bless this blemish for centuries -- their attempts had not gone unnoticed and the Demon led Protectorate Hunters attacked. <BR>

Alexandrian Museum, the most famous library of classical antiquity.  Here we find the reported vampire that is seen walking during the day.  This Vampire, a Protectorate Scholar member by the name of Talakasi Sakakura - an ally of the now deceased Testuoshi Family - had just recently found out that the Tetuoshi were wiped out due to the information he gave over to his Protectorate superiors about the family.  Honoribly, he decided to kill himself as penance to his anciestors. Before the ritual of death though -- he placed a single call to Hong Kong.<BR>
<BR>
"Nico-san - I call to warn you.  Andrei - he comes for your tonight."  These were his words as was recorded. <BR>
<BR>
During the eclipse - he left  the museum - walked out front and stood there until the sun shone down upon his body and poof , up in smoke he went. <BR>

<BR>
The Vampire Hunter, Andrei Brezianu stayed in Japan.  The destruction over there from the natural disasters on the 2nd are being slowly rebuilt.  He stayed there in hopes of tracking down allies of the 3 families and tying up loose ends so to speak.<BR>
<BR>
One such ally was found.  Nicolas Lannier.  Reports confirm that Lannier had been tracked down and a fight ensued.  However, there has been no reports received from Andrei since that night.  It is not known whether Andrei has gone rouge, or whether he has not had an opportunity to report to his superiors.  Only time will tell. </HTML>
