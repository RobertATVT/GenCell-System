<BR>
Thru whatever contact you deem, the following information is being delivered to your character about the warehouse and his/her PC contact in Voletta.  Don't use any named NPC in the official posts yet.  They are still not be available for any character to character contacts.  Please do not role-play or Post any actions for these NPCs. You know they will be coming to town.  You can feel it in your bones that something big is brewing.  Expect additional information by the end of the month about these NPCs.<BR>
<BR>
Okay. . now down to business.  . . the SN of your PC Protectorate contact in Voletta is CrusaderMartel.  Please email him to arrange IC playing or Post threads that involve you contacting him in game.  <BR>
<BR>
Your character has been told that there is a warehouse on the island and is now currently set up as a main base of operation for the Protectorate.<BR>
<BR>
Please DO NOT role-play any situation where your character approaches this warehouse until you have contacted Crusader-mun.  You character has been given a telephone number to call. Not a name.  Not a location. Just a seven digit unlisted number.  This is not unusual practice for the Protectorate, subterfuge is common and caution is always being taken.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a list of SNs of player characters that are Protectorate members in Voletta ranking from Level 1 to Level 4. If you know these people IC from previous RPs, you can contact them and pass along the above information.  If your character does not know thru IC knowledge a name listed below, then you will have to have some form of role-play or post thread contact before approaching them.  <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Be warned!  The above list is of both Scholars and Hunters.  Rumors are flying that there has been friction between these two sects over the Breed Slaying going on over the last few weeks.  Not everyone you contact may be friendly.  Some may be undercover traitors to the Protectorate.  Others may simply be a few cards shy of a full deck.  Are you a Breed?  Are they a Breed?  Will you be able to put aside personal prejudices for the sake of the organizations brotherhood?  Good luck and enjoy the role-playing that comes from this SL. <BR>
<BR>
Please be sure to post any logs or link up any posts you've written about this SL to the Mind Vault Post Links Folder to make sure you get A&B for your efforts!<BR>
  <BR>
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. <BR>
<BR>
Have fun!<BR>
