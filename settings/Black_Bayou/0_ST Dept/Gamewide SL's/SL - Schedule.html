I will need you to stick to this schedule.  Game wide events will be occurring starting on June 2nd and your SL along with a few others will be used as a ... well as a Countdown to Doomsday. ::chuckles::   Since you were unable to get with me tonight, we may have to forgo the actual RP of these deaths and just work on a day to day occurrences of what I can release to the media and SD. <BR>
<BR>
I am forwarding you a copy of the current Island Map.  I will need you to pick the locations of where the bodies will be left.  Some locations I would suggest very public places for the drop offs to occur.  Perhaps business locations could be used? Or some other spot that could be used by others and rp'd out?  Two dead bodies found laying in front of the Holy Grounds Coffee shop?  Now that would cause a stir for the business owner as well as give some interesting RP for others involved in investigating the scene of the crime.  Please get with me so we can work these details out. <BR>
<BR>
I would like to have four eyewitnesses.  Two for the police, two for the media.  Neither witness will be able to give much information, but I would like to be able to have some sort of conduit to use to get information to the media and police.  Also, these victims will have families and such.  I may try to file missing person reports and the like for SD involvement.  Do you have any suggestions on how this could be worked? <BR>
<BR>
I need a physical description of what Matthew looks like.  I realize you will be wearing black when the deeds are done.  But things like Height, Weight, Scent, Shoe Size, left handed or right, etc., need to be available to me so I can 'feed' this information over.  I would also like to know what weapon you will be using to carve the initials in the body.  The county coroner will have this information. <BR>
<BR>
I don't expect you to RP out the 120 NPC deaths -- however once this is all said and done -- you will be expected to start rp'ing scenes in the MR and attempt to give some additional clues to those who are following and trying to solve your crime spree. :) <BR>
