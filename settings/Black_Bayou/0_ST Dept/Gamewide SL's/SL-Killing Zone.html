<BR>
1) Title of Storyline<BR>
Kill Zone.<BR>
<BR>
2) Players involved (screen and character names)<BR>
RichyRland, Drkzion, anyone else I can interest.<BR>
<BR>
3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
<BR>
We're gonna kill Zion, Davis, and anyone else who annoys the people who are helping..<BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)<BR>
<BR>
Richy doesn't like Z and Davis. Zion just elected hisself Asst Mayor. Two of the City Council is Vampires, so the meetings have to be at night.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>(( I need verification from you as to who these two members are and how Richy knows they are Vampires. I will need to contact those two people and verify this information.)) </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><I><BR>
<BR>
Richy recruits friends(Andrew briggs most notably, and other people as RP dictates)<BR>
They hide out a ways away from the city hall, when Zion and Davis are having a city council meeting.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>((Each person in the SL that you recruit must sign a player approval letter for the SL - this means they will receive a copy of the SL in full.  I want detailed logs kept and sent directly to <B>me </B>of each and every PC involved <g> You will need to log extensively <B>all </B>RPs you have concerning this SL.  I wish to avoid appeals and if you build an airtight SL then we should have none. I need to know the exact location in which you plan on making your ambush from.  )) </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><I><BR>
<BR>
They have to come out..when they do, Richy and allies shoot them until they die.<BR>
<BR>
This SL is secret, and shouldn't be sent to anyone, especially not Zion, since he'd manip out of it, or Davis, cause he'll give it to Zion.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>((Death SLs must be personally approved by the FD.  A copy of all SLs are given to SL Department staff members, the FD and the AFD.  A GM and quiet possibly two ( at least )  STs will be needed to complete this SL.

Davis and Zion will <B>not</B> be notified of this SL.))</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><I><BR>
<BR>
It can occur at any time that the council has a meeting, which, since it's unspecified, can be any time I want to trigger the attack, especially if Zion or Davis Post about a Council meeting in the CH Folder. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>(( I cannot approve a Death SL that bases it's RP thru post threads.  BB Room II will be open soon and  there are plans for a once a month Town Meeting event held for the City Hall folks.  The time and dates of the Town Meetings will be posted on the Message Boards.  Once you have decided when you wish to make your attack, you can contact me and I can set up the GMd event with the Staff working in on the SL.  This way we don't find ourselves short handed for your assassination attempts. ))</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><I><BR>

The defenses they can bring with them are the ones that they have specified for themselves leaving the City Council area.

<BR>
The attack itself will be a sniper attack, using the thermal-proof equipment and such that HUnter Bane used to such great effect, and silenced, flash suppressed guns </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>(( I need a more detailed list of what it is you want.

<BR>
Neither person will touch the bullets without gloves and there will be no scent or other way to ID them through the bullets, the guns can't be traced back to Richy or any other PC.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>(( I cannot guarantee that you will be able to handle the bullets and not leave any scent.  What type of gloves will you wear?  Rubber?  Plastic?  Leather?  Is your scent a supernatural scent or will the scent of the gloves be left on the used bullets?  Be sure to include in your logs and any posts how the bullets are handled.  A ST/GM ruling will be made in <B>advance </B>on this call.

The group, beforehand secures all loose articles and makes sure there will be no fiber or hair left behind in the scene, they also meticulously plan an escape route, dropping into shadow manipulation or the equvilent and moving through the swamp to the gulf, where they will swim, to one of Briggs's boats. Where they will shed the gear into the Ocean where it will never be discovered(weighted down) </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>((Another post.  I want detailed actions before hand.  I want the escape route planned.  Your escape route time will be determined by an ST/GM during the scene, however I want to see some time put towards which direction, what type of vehicle (if any) and what location you plan on going to in the ocean.  I will forward you a map of Voletta that we are currently using.  Also... remember, if you are shot and you bleed that could very well leave dna evidence that could be later picked up.  There are no guarantees with this type of SL and the unknown could always happen. )) </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><I><BR>

If they are not caught in the fight they will not be caught. And due to the fact that the equipment keeps them from being seen, they are camoflaged and they will be firing silenced, flash suppressed guns at a long distance, people aren't allowed to shoot back.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>((These steps of obfuscation will be noted and we'll have a predetermined modifiers ready for any firearms shots sent in your direction.
