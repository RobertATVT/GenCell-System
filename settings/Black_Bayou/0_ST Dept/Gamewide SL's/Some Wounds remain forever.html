<BR>
Please Keep this Letter for your records.  I love this idea.  However, to stay on the side of caution, I will be removing you from the Protectorate SL mailing list.  Any information you will be getting on the Protectorate will be going thru your NPC contact within that organization.  in order to make sure that you do continue to have such a connection, please contact me for any information that you think you will need to help you along with your approved SL.  <BR>
<BR>
Feel free to 'off' any NPC Protectorate members that you see fit.  Please remember though, do -not- use any named NPCs in any of the Game Wide SL posts in your own personal posts. RPd scenes with Protectorate NPCs will be available to kill at your leisure. <BR>
<BR>
This SL will need to be renewed in six months and is considered a 'Death SL'.  If you do go after any PC Protectorate members then I will need you to keep logs of any encounters you have with these PCs and forward these logs to me so I can keep them in your approved SL file within the SL Department.<BR>
<BR>
HOST ANT Burial has been assigned to be the ST in charge of this Death SL and should be the ST in charge of any STd events that come from your RP.  I understand that it may be inconvenient to set up STd events around your and his schedules and if need be, you can get another ST to run your scenes.  However, with having an ST who already knows the background of your submission, it should be less time consuming for all involved if Burial is the one to run any combat scenes that may stem from your SL. <BR>
<BR>
Any logs or posts that you put up concerning your SL should be linked or posted in the Mind Vault - Post Link folder so we can keep track of the A&B points that you will accumulate for this SL.  Here is a link to how logs and posts should be posted in that folder.  <A HREF="aol://5863:126/mB:444965:1">Welcome to The Mind Vault - Post Links!</A><BR>
<BR>
I hope you have a wonderful time with this SL.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. <BR>
<BR>
Thank You.<BR>

3) Summary (what you want to happen): </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>Through my posting series, Death Comes Riding, Hunter will be "introduced" to the Protectorate.  The meeting will most assuredly -not- be a good one.  Through a twist of fate, too much caution, and a healthy dose of dislike (towards SA Marcus Young, a member of the Protectorate), some very bad things happen, and cause a vast dislike for the Protectorate to be born in Hunter.  He will see them as bastards that care only for their own existance, and nothing more.  And what do we do with these bastards?  Eliminate them, of course. <BR>
	Everything that the Protectorates stand for, in Hunter's view and mind, will be anathema to him.  He will work to destroy them, or as many as he can before they finally catch up to him.  He will attempt to recruit as many as he can, in opposition of this "evil" force.  While his animosity towards all people is still present, he can still orchestrate some sort of group, in whatever form it might take.<BR>

4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen): </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"></I>Well, posting will be the way this (for the most part) will be carried out.  Working nights really limits my actual play time.  I'm not terribly sure how I will find out who all would oppose the Protectorates..but I'm sure -something- will fall into my lap.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><I><BR>
