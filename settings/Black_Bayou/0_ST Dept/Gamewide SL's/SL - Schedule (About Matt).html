Little Something About Matthew- <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I>Name:</B></I>Matthew Simon Bishop (had his name legally changed to this)<B><I><BR>
Breed:</B></I>Vampire<B><I><BR>
Age: </B></I>25<B><I><BR>
Eye Color: </B></I>Baby Blue<B><I><BR>
Hair: </B></I>Black<B><I><BR>
Height/weight: </B></I>6' 1, 208 lb.<B><I><BR>
Occupation: </B></I>Matthew's currently a PI for Omsford Investigations.<B><I><BR>
Equipment: </B></I>Platinum Cross, 7 x 1.5 inch stainless steel hunting knife, Death Dragon (AKA- The Matt Mobile)<B><I><BR>
Appearence: </B></I>His hair is like silken midnight; his eyes are like blue puddles of crystalline ice. His wardrobe consists of jeans, black shirt, and his leather jacket at most times. His heart is pure, untainted evil and his mind warped with madness. Within each vein flows cruelty and darkness. His face has grown to be feared by a few and spit upon by others, though Matthew has managed to keep as many allies as possible to later crush with an iron fist. His breath usually smells of Scotch, his clothes soiled with cigarette smoke. His shoe size ranks 12 inches, his usual shoe being something sporty while cheap at the same time. He'd as soon buy a pair of Target shoes than Nike at most times. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
