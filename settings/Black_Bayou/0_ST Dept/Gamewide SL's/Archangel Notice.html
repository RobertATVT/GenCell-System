You are being provided with this information because of the high ranking status that you hold within Angelic society. <g>  I do encourage you to participate in the plotline that has been presented and hope that you find some amount of RP value from the Silver Future Storyline.<BR>

If you  have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>A few weeks ago a horrible blow was dealt to the Angel Breeds. Six</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> Archangels were slain throughout the world, 53 total Angels killed in the process.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Sudan, Central African Repulbic and Cameroon</B> had been engulfed in flames as an out of control border raid from Eritrea into Ethiopia fails.  A not so nice branch of Hunters,  had managed to worked their way into this War and a destructive attempt to destroy  an encampment of soldiers (Angels) turns into massive kill zone.  The fighting between the two groups caused fires to dot along the dry grasslands,  and spread west into theh three above mentioned countries.<BR>
<BR>
Four Arch Angels are to die in this massive destruction.  This supposidly inconsequentail  strip of land is actually the location that the body of Ramses was deposited upon centuries ago after he gave chase to Moses upon the parting of the Red Sea.  Cursed by God, the remains held about them an unholy taint that spread about the desert and has caused nothing but stride and striff for anyone or anything that has ever lived there. The Four slaughtered Angels had been attempting to Bless this blemish for centuries - their attempts had not gone unnoticed and the Hunters attacked. <BR>
<BR>
Little is known about the Hunters that slaughtered many of your kind.  One can assume that there is a group that has struck out against the Angel Breed.  There is whispered words along the gossip network that the name Bii is one to be feared. <BR>
<BR>
You and your Flock may not have any connection to those across the waters.  But word of mouth does travel and the above information has been dropped in your ear.  As an Arch Angel, I would like to see this information trickled down to those beneath you.  Please, don't just forward this email to those in your Flock.  Posts and RP are wonderful tools that I'd like to see used in getting this information out.  I can however, understand IRL circumstances that may prevent you from role-playing or posting, certainly I would not frown upon this email being forwarded to your group under that type of situation. <g> <BR>
<BR>
You are more than welcome to become as descriptive as you like with this information.  You may choose not to release everything you know about the Angels to those beneath you.  <eg>  You may even choose to tell a different tale than what has been provided above.  Have fun with this.  And please - contact me for anything you may need. :) <BR>
