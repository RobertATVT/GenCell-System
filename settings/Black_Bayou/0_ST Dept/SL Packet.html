These are the leaders of any major business.  They are the ones that make the major decisions, doing so for the greater good of business, regardless of what many people think about them.  They are paid a small fortune, but that's only because the amount of responsibility they hold.  They must manage things so that one little thing will never tip the balance of the company and cause the stock prices to crumble. To purchase this occupation, you must have an approved SL.

	Wouldn't it be wonderful if we all could be millionairs? There wouldn't be any world hunger and everyone would live in peace and harmony. Unfortunately, that isnt' realistic. Granted this is a fiction game and reality has little bearing on it. Or does it? The element of conflict is needed for all things.<BR>
	Therefore, we have this set up with a storyline requirement. What types of things would we need listed in this SL. The Company your a CEO of, why did they send you to Isle Voletta, what will you be doing in the Isle, are you setting up a new branch in the Isle. <BR>
	Those are the main bits of information that is required.<BR>

</B>Government agents have a number of different origins.  From the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Central Intelligence Agency to the highly secret National Security Agency.  These organizations are deeply rooted with sub-organizations so clouded in secrecy that they often don't recognize each other in the field.  All Player Character government agents begin as a low ranking field agent for whichever agency they belong to.  Also, you never know how many ex-agents there are lurking in the shadows...just what is their angle?<BR>

 	The Isle of Veils is a small town and we can only fit so many FBI agents in here at one time. As a result we have only so many slots for this occupation available. Does this mean that you can't be an Agent? No what this means is that you need to sell us on that fact that you would be a good agent. Make this the most inventive and intrigueing agent application you can think of. There are lost of benefits to be a agent, but they do all work for the government. No matter how corrupt they end up in the end, they do have to stay within the law and be willing to work hard.<BR>

The men and women in blue, justice over all, highly trained and fully equipped to handle every crisis.  Well, almost any crisis. The modern day heroes.  Anyone can be an ex-officer, but only those that get hired by the Sheriffs Department are active officers in-character.<BR>

<B>Advantage:</B>   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.<BR>

	Having gone over FBI agents I think that you can understand the reasoning behind needing an SL for this as well. We need to know where you trained, why you are moving to the Isle and what type of officer you are, this also means getting the current sheriff's approval. You need to be hired, treat your SL like an application of sorts and list all of the ways that your going to go about making this happen.<BR>

</U>Age <BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>Age can play a very important part in the life of a demon, angel and vampire. With age comes power. How can you make an old character with the current guidelines for generation?<BR>
	It's very simple. You can't. There isn't a way for a new character to gen at an older characters rate, you have to earn your points.<BR>
	However, with a storyline you can create an older character. How? Simple. Give us a good reason to allow you to be old. Were you sleeping from wounds done to you? Were you watch the world from on high? Maybe you were trapped in hell waiting for release to march the earth again? Or perhaps you walked the earth several times but were forced into deep hiding making you unable to learn to be very powerful? <BR>
	All of these are valid options for an SL of age to be approved.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
	There are only a few reasons why a SL would be needed to become a breed, and that is to become an Angel or a Demon, or to leave an existing breed to become Mortal.  In the event of what breeds can do what I will bring up the small chart in the rulebook that shows what a character can change to.<BR>
<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	All of the Highlighted sections above need a Storyline to be passed, with the exception of a Vampire and Werewolf becoming a mortal, all of them need to be approved by the Breed Coordinator and the SL Dept., which means that you will have a minimum of two people that will be looking over your SL.  The things that are looked for overall is creativity and depth.  Just saying that you pray to the dark and a demon is sent to you... doesn't cut it.  If you have a very well written storyline and it's all dark and vile and you get to the end and you have the Demon of Bugs Bunny sent into you... well that won't work either.  Angel and Demon storylines should be more than I just wanted to become one, they should include motive and some amount of intrigue.  Demons and Angels don't decide to meld with a host on a whim, it's a very long process of choosing who is right for the job.  Why would a Demon or an Angel want to use you for a host?  These answers should be in the Sl and it will not be approved without them.</HTML>
