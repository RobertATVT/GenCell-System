<B>Luck</B> - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, not highest.  The mortal can only enact this mastery once per scene.<BR>
   <BR>
<B>Adrenaline</B> - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +4 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 EMT's will arrive by ambulance, white with red and gold lettering indicating that it is part of Isle Voletta's Emergency Medical Response unit. EMT's will be dressed in blue uniforms and any dispatched from an ambulance will be carrying a standard issue medical kit. The ambulance contains most equipment to sustain human life until arrival at a hospital. EMT's are also equipted with pepper spray in the event of uncontrollable circumstances. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></I></U>EMT's will never use force unless they are directly attacked, as they are here to help, not to cause further injury.  EMTs in Voletta not only carry pepper spray, but sometimes such things are necessary to keep violent yet injured victims from hurting themselves more.  EMT's make medical rolls as described in the rulebook.  EMT's have no levels of lore and reactions to characters of different breeds should be RPed accordingly.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </HTML>
