<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A K9's sense of smell is so strong and acute, that their sense of smell can sometimes compensate for their sense of sight.  K9's that utilize their sense of smell can effectively "see" in complete darkness.  It can distinguish between the many different scents around it and can pinpoint their exact location.  This allows the K9 to ignore any penalties due to vision.  Strong winds or powerful smells can throw the K9 off.  The nuances are up to the room host, ST or GM.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

K9 units are teams that consist of a Deputy and a trained K9.  Both the dog and the Deputy spend most of their work time together.  The deputy is present during all stages of the dogs training and as in charge of the well being of the animal during it's time on the force.  The dog lives with the Deputy and is often times though of as family to the Deputy.  These K9's are of the German Shepherd breed.<BR>

The only time a K9 will attack a suspect is when their Deputy gives them the command, and then the force is simply to pressure the suspect to surrender to the Deputies.  In order for the K9 to scent and track the animal must first find the scent using it's Enhanced Masteries (Mastery) once the animal has the scent it can then track the scent down with a TN of 18 in ALL instances of scent tracking.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"><BR>
