</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Standard Sheriff's Deputy in Isle Voletta, charged with enforcement of the laws and protection of the Peace and Dignity of the Parish. There are about 20 of them on patrol. Their gold star gleams from the left chest of a Kakhi Uniform while mirrored shades are perched on their nose. They patrol in black and tan Ford Crown Victoria sedans, sometimes in pairs. Each patrolman's Sam Browne utility belt contains his Baretta F14 Sidearm, as well as two 9mm clips for the pistol, each containing 15 rounds. Two sets of handcuffs, a cannister of pepper spray, a walkie talkie with lapel mic, and a MagLite Flashlight also hang from the Deputy's waist. Under the kakhi of the uniform tunic is a Kevlar vest. (-2 damage against Small Arms. -1 damage against Large Arms.Wearer receives a -1 to their Dodge modifier.) In the cruiser's front seat is a locking rack for a Benelli Super 90 Riot Shotgun. The crowd pleaser packs nine shells in the magazine. In the event of a serious disturbance, the trunk of the patrol car contains equipment for Riot Control, including tear gas grenades and launcher.(2D6+Will Vs TN 24, Werewolves are -4 to the resistance roll because of their enhanced senses.  If successful, victim is -4 to Attack and Quickness for 4 rounds or 2 minutes ~This affects ALL breeds~). There is also a Taser (NonLethal Weapons) and equipment for blocking off a crime scene, including flares, evidence baggies, drug identification kit, crime scene tape, and a gas mask. There is also a utilitarian tool kit, usable for minimal roadside assistance. Deputies are authorized to detain, arrest and transport to the Sheriff's Station anybody suspected of breaking the laws of Voletta Parish. Use of deadly force is a last resort.<BR>

<B>Luck</B> - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, not highest.  The mortal can only enact this mastery once per scene.<BR>
   <BR>
<B>Adrenaline</B> - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +4 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to  add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Standard Senior Deputies in Isle Voletta are charged with enforcement of the laws and protection of the Peace and Dignity of the Parish and are the rolemodels for their younger Deputy counterparts. There are about 5 of them on patrol, one usually in each section of the city with a new Deputy. Their gold star gleams from the left chest of a Kakhi Uniform while mirrored shades are perched on their nose. They patrol in black and tan Ford Crown Victoria sedans, sometimes in the drivers seat, but mostly they let the rookies drive. Each Senior Deputy carries the same Sam Browne utility belt as their counterpart, though the Senior Deputies is usually a little more worn.  It contains his Baretta F14 Sidearm, as well as two 9mm clips for the pistol, each containing 15 rounds. Two sets of handcuffs, a cannister of pepper spray, a walkie talkie with lapel mic, and a MagLite Flashlight also hang from the Senior Deputy's waist.

Senior Deputies are authorized to detain, arrest and transport to the Sheriff's Station anybody suspected of breaking the laws of Voletta Parish. Use of deadly force is always a last resort, but self defense is never denied.  Unlike a code 5 for general backup in which Deputies arrive, the Senior Deputy will only arrive for Code 6 calls from Deputies already on the ground and in desperate trouble.<BR>
