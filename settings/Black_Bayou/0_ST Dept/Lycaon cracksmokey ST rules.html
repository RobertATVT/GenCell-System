</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Hey there, I have detailed a few aspects of the storyteller scene that needed some clarification.  Please review the revised storyteller training module and sign and sent the small form at the bottom.  Please be aware that a new rule has been added to the rules that are read before a storyteller scene takes place.  Be sure to update your files.  I also act that you don't alter the wording in the rules, I understand some of us copy & paste and don't use powertools to macro them, but just be aware that the rules are worded the way they are for a reason.  Any questions, my mailbox is always open.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks!<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Black Bayou Scene Guidelines</B><BR>
<BR>
1) Out Of Character comments are to be kept to a minimum.  Should they get out of hand a negative one to ALL rolls will be assigned to assure future cooperation.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>OOC in the private room where the scene is taking place is not prohibited like it is when you are in the main gaming room of Black Bayou, however it is recommended that as a storyteller you do not allow the OOC to get out of hand.  Use your discretion to ascertain the appropriate level of OOC within the room and to make sure you enforce it the same every time you are the storyteller of the scene.  The punishment to the rolls of players should only be used as a last resort and should always be issued only after warning the player within Instant Message and within the private room so it is in the log.  <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
2) Should for some reason you need the scene to be paused, please type #pause# within the room and then Instant Message me with the reason for the pause request.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Anytime a player wishes to pause a scene this should be displayed in the room for the log.  If it is a case where someone has punted please be sure to put the time that the player punted in the room.  All of this is required for the log so that when an appeal is being reviewed all the appropriate pause stamps are in place.  When a pause has been requested it is your duty as a storyteller to make sure no further actions take place until the reason for the pause is resolved.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
3) Should you have a problem with a call that I have made please pause the scene and Instant Message me.  Please use direct quotes from the rulebook to back up your claim and to save time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>It is extremely important that you make it clear to the players that they need to back-up their claims with quotes from the rulebook.  We do this to keep down on the need for them to argue with you in Instant Message as well as within the room.  They must take the time to find the mistake in the rulebook and then to bring it to your attention.  At this point it is a clear cut case in most instances, either you made a mistake or you did not.  If you made a mistake you should correct it right away, if you didn't make it clear to them that they are mistaken.  Please be professional at all times when a player is speaking with you and do not allow the situation to escalate.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
4) Any player, at any time may freeze a scene for an extended period of time, should they meet the requirements of the "Extended Scene Freezing Guidelines"<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>This is a new rule that is to be read within the room.  The purpose of this is to let the players know that they do have the authority to freeze a scene should they need to.  The new section has been provided to allow players a little more freedom in the game and to keep their gaming experience enjoyable.  Sometimes the worst thing to a player is the fear of being stuck in a scene without a way to get out when Real Life comes to call on them, many a fight has risen from this scenario. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
5) Should you find a problem with this scene at a later date you have up to 48 hours to appeal this scene to LDRS ANT BB Mail.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Please be sure to make sure that the SN for the appeal is up to date at all times.  Every player has the right to appeal a scene they were involved in, and have up to 48 hours to submit that appeal.  Appeals can be submitted based on either OOC or IC problems.  If a player asks you a question on the topic of an appeal they wish to file, please be careful how you answer.  If a player provides you with information and asks you if they have a chance to win an appeal please direct them to submit it to staff for review.  Do not get their hopes up or make them decide not to file their appeal.  Everyone has the right to appeal and by putting a thought into their head they may lose their chance to win an appeal.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
6) Anything can happen, within the rules of Black Bayou, in a scene witnessed by a Storyteller.  Players may die, may be injured, may be arrested, and many other things.  Please be aware that the outcome of this scene is not controllable and I cannot alter it's direction.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>This has to be one of the most serious guidelines that a player sees.  Many a player will stop here and choke up for a few moments at the realization they may not make it out of here.  None of us would honestly be happy to loose a character, but there is the chance it may happen therefore we must make the players aware of that.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
Do all players involved understand these rules as they have been stated?  If no, please Instant Message me with what is not understood or agreed to.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Should a player decide to not agree with the guidelines please Instant Message them and ask why they do not agree.  Sometimes it's because they feel they shouldn't be there, or that the scene was set up wrong.  Sometimes they just don't understand a rule and need to have to explained to them.  The scene cannot continue without everyone agreeing to these rules, if after a time you still cannot get that one player to agree you must freeze the scene and submit a report to the Storyteller Manager for review.  If everyone does agree, you can all move on to the remainder of the scene.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
<B>Extended Scene Freezing Guidelines</B><BR>
<BR>
         Anyone, at any time has the right to freeze a scene that they are involved in.  The freezing of the scene is limited to a 14 day period unless the scene meets special circumstances that may extend this time limit.  The following are valid reason's for a player to freeze a scene:<BR>
1) Must tend to Real Life, unable to remain on the computer<BR>
                 ex) Dinner, School, Work, Sleep, ect.<BR>
2) A player is a Host in Black Bayou, and is unable to get someone to fill in for them.<BR>
3) A player is a member of another Forum on AOL and must leave to attend to their    duties in that Forum.<BR>
4) A player wishes to file an Out Of Character charge and wishes to stop the scene until judgment is rendered.<BR>
 <BR>
        A Storyteller may also freeze a scene for an extended period of time for the following reasons:<BR>
1) The Storyteller must attend to Real Life<BR>
                 ex) Dinner, School, Work, Sleep, ect.<BR>
2) The Storyteller is a Host in the Bayou and is unable to get someone to fill in for them during their assigned shift.<BR>
3) The Storyteller wishes to gather more knowledge that may be required for the scene, such as a Storyline that may affect the outcome, or information that may be required for completion.<BR>
<BR>
         The following are reason's that a scene MUST be frozen, regardless of player or storyteller's wishes:<BR>
1) A player is punted and does not return<BR>
2) The scene has moved into the realm where a gamemaster is required<BR>
3) The scene requires a Storyline<BR>
<BR>
         The 14 day scene freeze limit is not set in stone and is subject to extension or removal by either the Head Storyteller or by the Forum Director.  Such scenes will be reviewed on a case by case basis.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Scenes requiring a Gamemaster</B><BR>
<BR>
         There comes a time in some scene's when a gamemaster is required to witness the scene.  Sometimes a gamemaster only needs to be present and not actually run the scene, however there are times where a gamemaster is required to run the scene.<BR>
<BR>
1) A scene involves a complex storyline that has been approved by the storyline department<BR>
2) A scene involves a -large- number of players.  Anything over 15 players involved requires the presence of a gamemaster. The gamemaster is not required to run the scene, but to be present.<BR>
3) A scene where NPC's are involved<BR>
<BR>
         If one of these scenes come up, and a gamemaster is not online at the time, the scene must be frozen per the Scene Freezing guidelines.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Law Enforcement Arrival<BR>
</B>         <BR>
         With the usage of PC and NPC Law Enforcement officers in the game, a system has been developed to allow the Storytellers of Black Bayou to have a consistent way of bringing law enforcement into a scene.  Whenever a scene is brought into the hands of a storyteller, the storyteller should do all they can to find officers that are players within the game, they should only rely on non-player character officers as a last resort.  An officer can be notified on any screen name should they not be on their player name.  <BR>
         An officer will arrive on scene depending on a roll that must be made if they are not already on scene when the ST is called for.  When the storyteller finds a need for an officer the scene will be paused until all that will be responding are brought into the private room where the scene is taking place.  It will then be determined how the officer will be arriving, whether they were on patrol or not at the time.  More on these definitions later.  Once it has been agreed to how the officer is arriving, the officer will make the roll for the length of their arrival based on the rolls listed below.  The only time the storyteller will make the roll for officer arrival is when non-player officers are being used in cases where players were not found.  <BR>
         Arriving on scene is defined as the time when the law enforcement official is at a point where they can freely see a majority of the scene in question.  The first round of their arrival on scene is limited to evaluation of the surrounding area and person's involved, no offensive physical actions may be taken this round, however they are allowed to dodge should they need to.<BR>
         A law enforcement officer may -NOT- activate a mastery while driving their cruiser or running to the location as it requires concentration that cannot be achieved while doing another activity.  Should an officer decide to activate a mastery during their required arrival time then a round will be added to arrival time for every round taken from mastery activation.<BR>
         An officer arriving to a scene by foot may make an Athletics roll that can reduce the amount of time it takes them to run by half.  The roll is 2d6+body+athletics Vs TN 25.  This roll is only allowed when arriving on foot, and not when using a cruiser as means of arrival.<BR>
         In a case where the scene that they have been called to requires a large portion of time on foot such as the beach, the woods or another place far from roads or flat safe driving surface the roll for arriving on foot will be used.<BR>
         An officer that is on patrol is defined as an officer that is in the mainroom, role-playing in their cruiser at the time of the pause.  The on patrol officer must be in the cruiser at the time of the pause and must be capable of handling a call from dispatch.<BR>
         An officer that is not on patrol is defined as an officer that is on duty at the present time but not in their cruiser patrolling the roads.  The officer can either be role-playing at the present time in the mainroom or not.  If they are role-playing at the present the definition of not on patrol is an officer at the station or an officer that is out of their cruiser at the time of the call.  Should the officer be called in from another screen name and not playing at the time it will be assumed they were either out of the cruiser or at the station and are on duty, just not presently patrolling.<BR>
         When a call for police is received both the Sheriff's Department and the Police Department will be notified, either group of officers may arrive on scene.  As well, the FBI are also notified, but will only arrive on scene if the crime is within their jurisdiction.  Those circumstances include, but not limited to the following: bank robberies, terrorist situations, hostage situations, murder scenes where a serial killer is involved, murder scenes of a public official, and all calls where an officer down call has been sent.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Required rolls for Law Enforcement Officers<BR>
</B><BR>
Officer on foot               - 6d2 for arrival (6 - 12 Rounds)<BR>
Officer not on patrol     - 4d2 for arrival (4 - 8 Rounds)<BR>
Officer on patrol            - 2d2 for arrival (2 - 4 Rounds)<BR>
NPC officer arrival        - 2d6 for arrival (2 - 12 Rounds)<BR>
<BR>
Here is a generic example to give you an understanding of the system.<BR>
<BR>
<I>         A fight is occurring at the beach, it is the top of round three and the police have been called by one of the individuals involved.  At the end of the round the scene will be paused until the storyteller has gathered all the officers that will arrive.  Once the officers are gathered it is found that Officer A was playing at the time of the fight in the mainroom and was in their cruiser, Officer B was playing but was at the Symp, and Officer C was gotten from another screen name, so is therefore considered not on patrol.  The following three officers make the following rolls:<BR>
         Officer A - 2d2 (Is on patrol, therefore could drive on the beach)<BR>
         Officer B - 6d2 (Given he is at the Symp, it would be assumed he would go on foot)<BR>
         Officer C - 4d2 (Was not RPing, but is considered on duty, not on patrol)<BR>
         Now say that officer A rolls a one and a two.  Officer A will arrive in three rounds.  It is now the top of Round four, so at the top of Round seven the officer will be on scene.  They cannot make any offensive physical actions during round seven, but may make defensive actions.  Their next round, being round eight, would allow them full interaction in the scene.<BR>
<BR>
<B></I>Arrival of Non-Official players</B><BR>
<BR>
         At times players are brought into scenes that are not of the Law Enforcement nature.  These players will all arrive in either one of two ways.  The first way is on foot, the basic means of transportation for all humans.  The other was is by vehicle, such as that of car or truck.<BR>
         Arriving on scene is defined as the time when the person is at a point where they can freely see a majority of the scene in question.  The first round of their arrival on scene is limited to evaluation of the surrounding area and person's involved, no offensive physical actions may be taken this round, however they are allowed to dodge should they need to.<BR>
         A person may -NOT- activate a mastery while driving their vehicle or running to the location as it requires concentration that cannot be achieved while doing another activity.  Should a person decide to activate a mastery during their required arrival time then a round will be added to arrival time for every round taken from mastery activation.<BR>
         A player arriving to a scene by foot may make an Athletics roll that can reduce the amount of time it takes them to run by half.  The roll is 2d6+body+athletics Vs TN 25.  This roll is only allowed when arriving on foot, and not when using a vehicle as means of arrival.<BR>
         In a case where the scene that they have been called to requires a large portion of time on foot such as the beach, the woods or another place far from roads or flat safe driving surface the roll for arriving on foot will be used.<BR>
<BR>
Player by foot        - 6d2 (6 - 12 Rounds)<BR>
Player by vehicle  - 5d2 (5 - 10 Rounds)<BR>
