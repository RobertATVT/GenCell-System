</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0">For thse of you that aren't ST's we are needing more of them.  If you are in any way interested in recieving ST training, please respond to this mail as soon as you are able.  As we all know ST's are becoming a rare breed in the bayou, and we could use more to get things done in a good timely fashion.  <BR>
<BR>
Below is a part of the trainer that you will all need to have in order to even be a host, that is the Police backup response times.  Apparently there are a good number of Hosts that do not have this information and whoever was responsible for their training didn't see fit to get it for you, so without further ado... here it is:<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>~ Police arrival times ~</B><U><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></U>	The ST rolls four, two sided dice.  Giving the SD arrival time 4 - 8 rounds.  This is for NPC's Only, the rules for PC cops are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Officer on foot			-  6d2 for arrival (6-12 Combat Rounds)<BR>
Officer not on Patrol		-  4d2 for arrival (4-8 Combat Rounds)<BR>
Officer on Patrol		-  2d2 for arrival (2-4 Combat Rounds)<BR>
<B><BR>
(Note that on duty response time only applies to CS's actively RPing in the Main Room as being on duty and patrolling)</B><BR>
<BR>
The dice can be found at Keyword: Dice.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Ex:  If an ST rolls (2 1 2 1) then the total is 6.  Add 6 onto the round you are curently at and that is the round the SD will arrive on scene and be able to act.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
<BR>
This is to be used for *all* Police arrivals, including PC's that are answering a call.  Just something that I thought you should all know, this section will be added to the rulebook as soon as the update is finished, but for now this is what you go by.  I would heartily suggest that as staff members you should all read the rules thoroughly, on every level of this game they are something you should know just on principle, as part of being staff is to assist players you cannot do so without knowing the rules yourself.  Well that's my that's my babble for the week, hope it makes sense for you all... till next ramble. <g><BR>
