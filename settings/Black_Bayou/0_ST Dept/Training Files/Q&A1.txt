<< </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="0">Can ReadTheSoul, demon mastery, be used to discover a persons breed. I asked this question a matter of months ago, and was told "yes", but when I informed HostAntCoyote that I was intending to use the mastery thus, he told me that -that- mastery was not allowed to be used to that cause.<BR>
 The prerequiste, MindScyre, says specifically that you can not ask a persons breed using -that- mastery, but ReadSoul says no such thing. Answer? </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(You may not ask 'What is your breed'. You may ask questions that may give you a good idea of said breed... but only if they have to deal with the characters deepest, darkest sins. Read the mastery description, it's pretty much clear cut.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 <BR>
 Liars Ears, demons again, doesn't say whether the person the mastery is being used on has to be present, so can I activate the mastery, and use it upon someone I am speaking to over a telephone? I, personally, should think the answer is yes, considering the mastery is called "Liars <B>Ears</B>", not "Eyes" <g> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Anyone attempting to lie to the demon... so yes, this works over the phone.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 <BR>
 What system is used for picking a doorlock? In the Combat section, it mentions that theiving a car is Mind Vs 12 (16 for alarm system), and to steal a car, I'd assume you have to pick the lock first? </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Depending on the lock... but yes, 2d6 + Mind vs some sort of TN is the norm. What that TN is depends on the ST.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 <BR>
 How is an attack against a staionary object system'd? For instance, if I were throwing a knife against a wall, is it 2D6+Attack Vs. TN? And is the TN variable depending on the location's surface area, such as a difference between a light switch and a window? </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Since the target is stationary, the TN is stationary as well. Ask the particular ST for the specifics.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 -Continueing from the previous question, if I were to throw a water-balloon of FaithWater at the ground near a Vampire (Random breed) feet, how is the damage and/or dodge system'd? </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>( This would be system'd as a normal attack vs. dodge roll. Even though you ate throwing it near their feet, you obviously want it to hit them, yes? Then they have a chance to dodge. ;)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 <BR>
 Under CorruptTheSoul, back to demon masteries again, it says that the effect must be RPed and Posted. How is this rule enforced? Is it OOCManip not to post the after-effects of the mastery? </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>( This, again, depends on the situation. But the victim of this mastery should play out the effects of not feeling any guilt about said action - if they're not playing it right [not necessarily posting about it, some people don't post] then they may be subject to the penalties for OOC manipulation.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 When targetting an attack against the victims legs, it says that double the amount of rounds are needed to escape, and defensive rolls are made with -2. Is this cumulative if the other leg is also attacked? 8 rounds to escape, with -4 defence? Or is escape impossible once both legs are injured? </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>( The effects are cumulative.) </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 -Continueing in that line of question.. Person #1 is using HeavyArms, and therefore using both hands to hold the weapon. Person #2 targets person #1's arm. Now, considering that person #1 is using both hands to hold the weapon, does he still drop the rifle? </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>( He would drop one hand off the rifle - and suffer the -2 to attack that is stated under the section for Targetting <Arms>. )</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
