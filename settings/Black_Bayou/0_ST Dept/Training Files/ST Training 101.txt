Welcome to ST Training 101.  This mailing is not intend to be a substitute for an actual training session.  Instead, what this is designed to do is to give you an overview of what it means to be an ST.  Some parts will be delved into more deeply than others.  Some will merely be glanced at, because -those- topics generally present the biggest obstacles in becoming a good ST, and I prefer to be onhand to answer any questions that you will/might have.  With that said, let's begin.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> We will be starting with setting up the scenario, as it is usually the easiest thing to accomplish.  Everything in this section is my person preference only, and it in NO WAY means that this is the only way that is acceptable.  On the contrary, I encourage every ST to find their own way of doing things, their preferred manner of operating.  So long as the job gets done fairly, correctly and expediently...I will be pleased.   <BR>
     On that note, I would like to take a very brief moment to inform you that if make any decision or call about any aspect of a fight...and you believe yourself to be in the right, I WILL back you up 100%.  Even if a call you make is overturned, I will not point a finger of blame, I will only state that "X" was the reason that "Such-and-such" could not have happened...and we will move on from there.  Just know that if this ever happens that it is not a person attack or issue...it is merely me doing my job as Advisor.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Set Up</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
<BR>
     I have found that having a Private Room on your favorite places list is a time saving way of running an ST event.  It allows you to easily send the room link out to everyone that is to be involved in the scenario without having to go to the minor bother of creating a new one each time.  Having a pen and paper handy is also another pre-fight way of saving yourself some grief.  By being able to write down, Round by Round, who has done what and when masteries will be going off, you are making your job that much easier.  This is so that if there is ever any question about when someone will arrive, or when something should occur, you can look back at your notes and say, "Here is what I have written down."  Trust me, this is a very valuable tool to use.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>When you are first contacted, by a Room Host/Player/ST, to run a scene, the very first thing you should do is find out if everyone involved has a valid CS.  This is simple enough to do, you simply ask the players involved if they have one, or ask the Room Host that might have contacted you to find out.  I have found that I dislike running fights in which characters without character sheets are in direct conflict with those that do have sheets.  I feel that this only serves to push away a potential player because he got killed before he even got to play.  I -strongly- encourage STs to not run fights for new players without sheets, but by no means will I base an appeal on their presence.  Instead I would suggest that the two RP the scene in the Main Room, that gives new players interaction with old players and to see what the game is about.<BR>
     The next thing I do is to ask the person that initiated the need for an ST for a list of everyone involved in the scene.  Once you have that list, go ahead and send out the PR room link to everyone through an IM invitation.  Once there, you need to assert control of the situation.  In general, players will be more than willing to listen to what you have to say..but you never know.  The easiest way to accomplish this is to start asking questions.  By having them answer your questions, you have inadvertantly assumed control of the scene, just as you were meant to.<BR>
     The first question I always ask is "Is this everyone that is supposed to be here?"  I always always always make sure that I ask one person this question.  I will generally ask the person that seems to be the most in the know of the situation.  Usually this person is an older player, bit not always.  Use your best judgement.  After that person has given you the answer, make sure to ask the room if what was said is accurate.  Sometimes poeple make mistakes, it is always best to verify with the group.  If someone else is supposed to be in the room, IM them with the room link and continue onwards.<BR>
     Next, I ask one person for the scenario.  "Why are we all gathered?"  Again, make sure you note that you are only asking one person.  I will usually start at the top of the room list and work my way down.  Sometimes there are some discrepancies in the description of events, and you will need to sort of what is fact from fiction.  Now and again you will need to go to the Room Host for verification of what was said.  This requires nothing more than an IM to said Host, asking if he/she knows what is going on.  At worst, the Room Host will need to send you the room log so that you can find out for yourself. This is a rare occurrence, as the players can usually decide on what has happened amongst themselves.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>At this point, you will need to have a good mental picture of what is going on, and where people are at.  If the players have not already given you their locations, now would be a good time to get them.  Take a few moments to orient yourself with the situation.  Is it raining?  Are there enough lights?  Do you need to impose vision penalties?  These are all things you will need to take into account when running a scene.  It is not necessary to memorize every table and every chart, but it is a very good idea to have a sort of "cheat sheet" with all the really pertinent information.  I will provide this cheat sheet in a later mailing.  Take some time to look it over, it has some things that you might not have known about in the past.<BR>
     Once you are prepared to start this little tango, have the players mail you their Character Sheets.  There are quite a few ways to keep track of all the sheets.  You could open them all, and then minimize them at the bottom of the screen.  You could leave them all in your mailbox, opening them when you feel it is needed to take a peek to see if all the numbers given are correct.  Any way you see fit to keep track of the sheets is fine.  One thing that I do encourage is that you actually look at the sheets, at least once.  To verify that there is a CS Staff signature to prove that it is a valid sheet.  Take a quick peek over the rest of the sheet, so that you can orient yourself to the numbers.  I realize some people are not that great with numbers, and that is not a big deal.  If you ever have any doubts, just look at the sheet and take your time.  If the players get antsy, simply tell them to hold while you check the information.<BR>

<BR>
     Now that you have gotten this far, you are doing great!  Here's where the real "fun" begins.  I use the word fun because some people really love running scenes, some STs loathe certain situations..and some just feel a little uncomfortable.  Never be too proud or ashamed to ask for help, that's what I am here for...as well as the other STs.  If you run into a situation where you are lost, or don't know where to find the answer...or whatever you need.  Ask!  <BR>
     If no one else is online that can give you the answer you need, you have a few options.  You could ask the players what they think should be done.  Sometimes the players have been here before, and they can give the correct answer.  Who knows?  It never hurts to ask.  Another option is to simply pause the scene until you can find the answer.  The best way to do this is to write me a mail including the details of the scene, and your question.  I check my mail numerous times a day, and I can get you an answer back usually the same day.  The option that I prefer you to use is to come up with something.  Make it up!  You've got a fair amount of freedom in what you do, and being creative is never frowned upon.  I openly encourage the STs to be inventive, throw something out there that is not expected.  By keeping the players on their toes, you make the game that much more interesting...and the players will respect you for that.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Now, onto the fight itself.  Running the rounds is very basic, all you need to do is keep track of the players' actions, whose turn it is and that sort of thing.  The players are the ones that have the vast majority of the duties here.  You are the mediator, the time keeper, the answer person.  So, in keeping with that, it is your duty to make sure this scene gets logged and sent to the proper people.  I prefer to not open a room log until I am ready to roll for initiative, but it is entirely up to you when you wish to start the log.  Some folks like to have from beginning to end, some start when the initiative starts...we all have our own preferences.  The only criteria that I insist on is that you -must- start the log before you list the rules for the scene.  <BR>
     To open a room log, go to My Files, then down to Log Manager.  Once there, you will need to title the log like this: 101099ST1 (ST Name).   This is read as October 10th, 1999...first ST log of the night.  If you have a second fight that evening, it would be 101099ST2, and so on.  I will skip to the end of the fight for one moment, so that all the information is in one place.  When the scene is over with, you will need to send the log out to HOST ANT Pagan, HOST ANT Chai, HOST ANT Lycaon, and HOST ANT Paradox (subject to change with who happens to be the Personnel Director and Assistant).  Also, should any of the players wish to have a copy, feel free to send one along to them.<BR>
     One thing I also do, before rattling off the rules to the players, is to have them RP the scene out until it comes to a point where initiative would be needed.  Now, a lot of times it has already come to that point, or why else would you be there?  But, I find it very helpful to have the players sort of...re-create the scene for me, so that everyone is on the same page.  This is just one more way to get a better "feel" for what is transpiring around you.  What constitutes and action that would require an ST?  Trying to strike someone, using a mastery, attempting to fire a weapon at an escaping vehicle, etc.  All these things, and more, are cause for me to stop the Role-play and initiate the initiative.  What does not constitute me to step in and take over?  Using skills, such as Fast Talk and Theology, one or more characters running after/chasing another character, etc.  Again, these are things that really are best left for playing out, and not using the dice.  Just always use your best judgment.  Should one or more characters be adamant about using initiative, well...go ahead and use it.  When to call for "inits" is a pretty flexible thing.<BR>
     Once you have stepped in and are ready to begin this scene, it is time to rattle off the rules of the road to all involved.  These rules -MUST- be given before each and every combat situation, or else the fight could easily be overturned by a player complaining, and no one wants that.  Also, these rules are just a standard.  The wording of each is totally up to you.  We do this to allow you a little more personalization...to make you, as an ST, have a certain way of doing things that the players will know is there.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>1)  No OOC once the fight has begun.  Each OOC comment after the first warning has been given will cause the player to receive a -1 to -all- rolls for the remainder of the scene.</B><BR>
   This rule is one that I have fun with.  Most of the players that have ever been in one of my ST'd events know that I do not care one way or the other if they make OOC comments.  I find that it makes the fight/scene a little more fun...and that is what I am there to do.  Some STs prefer to have OOC to a minimum, allowing for a few comments here and again.  This one is 100% up to your discretion.  If you want no OOC, then there is no OOC.  Whichever way you decide to run things, always always always make certain that you are consistent.  If not, the players will quickly lose trust in your abilities as an ST. Make a rule and stand by it.<BR>
   The -1 to all rolls is a sort of last resort tool for players that continually ignore your directions or instructions while in an event.  I use this punishment very sparingly, as most players have a semblance of respect for me as an ST.  You may not have the same luxury.  It is up to you to decide when you need to invoke the penalties, but I urge you to always remain constant in your decisions.  If one person gets a penalty, then everyone else that commits the same offense should as well.  This penalty is cumulative.  You can inflict as many as needed to regain control.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2)  If you have a question or need something, type (PAUSE) and IM me.</B><BR>
   This one is pretty simple and straightforward.  This is just done to keep the needless chatter out of the room, so that we can attempt to keep everyone in character.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3)  Do not argue with me.  If you feel that I have made an error, show me in the rulebook.</B><BR>
   This one is very important.  In order to keep the scene moving at a decent pace, you need to establish that you are not going to tolerate a player arguing with you.  What happens when a player begins to argue is that everyone else is held up while this player proceeds to make his/her case, and refuses to back down.  What I do to avoid these sorts of situations is to give the player about a minute to go through the rulebook and show me where he/she is right.  If they cannot come up with something inside of that time limit, then I tell them that they may appeal my decision later.<BR>
<BR>
   What happens when a call is made that is not in the rulebook, and how can that happen?  Simple.  STs are called upon to make odd calls all the time, be it TNs or just penalties for environmental situations, movement...any number of things.  When something like this happens, it will invariably cause someone in the scene to complain.  Know that right now.  Someone will -always- disagree with you.  What can you do, and what can they do to fix the problem?<BR>
   First, if it was a Target Number that you made, look it over to see if it actually fits the scene and difficulty.  Sometimes we make things a little too hard (or easy), and it never hurts to take another look at it.  If, after that time, you have thought it over and still feel right, then you inform the player and move on.  They always have the option to  appeal the decision (this will be discussed later).  <BR>
   If the problem lies with character placement, such as "John Doe was 50 feet away, how could he possibly leap the car and tackle me?!", that is pretty much up to you to decide if the action was possible, and plausible.  Players have their action phase in which they can do things that take no more than 3-6 seconds (this does not include talking.  I pretty much let players do their soliliquies..it makes 'em feel better.)  If "John Doe" has a fairly decent Athletics skill level, and is showing some sort of physical prowess, I will generally err in the favor of him, allowing that distance.  If the player is a three foot tall, 250 pound person with no Athletics....well, you can see where that one is heading.  Common sense is a key factor in decision making, -especially- when it comes to running a fight. The players will throw everything they have at you...so be flexible, be able to quickly and fairly make choices, and learn to see things from their point of view...after all, you could be in their shoes someday.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>4)  If you feel any or all of my decisions are wrong, you have 48 hours to appeal to ANT BB Mail.</B><BR>
   Appeals are a wonderful thing.  No, really.  We all make mistakes, and sometimes we make them while we are running a scene.  It is -no big deal-!!  I've made my fair share of them while running fights, and I certainly will not stop anytime soon.  It's just something that can happen.  That is when the player has the opportunity to bring their case before me, (or the AFD/FD should I be the ST in question),  and try to persuade me to see things their way.<BR>
   Anything can be appealed, from something as small as a penalty for lighting, to something as major as an OOC Manipulation driven fight.  I think every ST we have ever had has been involved in an appeal at one point or another, so don't worry about it.  So long as you make the best choices you can, and you have done your job fairly, no repercussions will ever come back on you.  Ever. <BR>
   We have set an appeals time limit at 48 hours to encourage the players to get it done and over with as quickly as humanly possible.  Why?  While an appeal is going on everyone in the scene has to be frozen.  This means that they cannot RP and gain any points for their time.  Which is not what we want to happen.  Another reason is that if we allowed appeals to happen whenever a player felt like it, a lot of RP could possibly be affected and rendered null and voided...and that is a huge pain in the butt.  Trust me.<BR>
   Something that a lot of players, and staff alike, don't know is that an appeal can be filed at any time in the scene.  In other words, if the player so vehemently disagrees with you, he/she has the right to ask for the scene to be paused until this matter can be resolved.  We try to discourage that sort of thing, because it places needless stress upon everyone involved.  If at all possible, keep the players in the scene and going until the end.  If a fight needs to be restarted at some point, fine...we gather up everyone and give it another shot.  But it is invariably less irritating to finish a scene than to have to stop right in the middle and wait for a decision to be reached. <BR>
<BR>
<B>5)  Someone may die in this scene.  </B><BR>
   That, in my opinion, is the most frightening line that any player could ever see.  It is bold, in your face...and you have to stop and think about what could happen.  I think this one speaks for itself.<BR>
<BR>
<B>6)  Do you all agree to these rules?</B><BR>
   You have to ask this question before the fight begins.  Why?  It's a lot like the Miranda Rights.  Those involved must be made aware of the rules that they are expected to follow, or else how can they know what they can and cannot do?  These rules are for everyone's safety, including your own.<BR>
   If someone says "no", IM them and ask them  why they do not agree to the rules.  If it is something like they do not have the time right now I will usually try to see if I know the mun, and if they are known for skipping out on fights.  If I feel that they are merely trying to postpone the fight because they don't want anything bad to happen to their character, I will not allow them to leave.  I'm not a big fan of people playing that game.  If it is an honest need to leave, for work or sleep or whatnot, I will ask the room if they would mind either holding off on this scene, or perhaps be willing to role-play it out.  A lot of times the players can come up with their own solutions.<BR>
   Should the reason for saying "no" be that the player does not feel he/she should be here, ask why.  Find out exact details.  Maybe the player thinks that this incident is all OOC Manip.  If that is the case, find out why the player feels that way.  If it is something that can be verified by the Room Host (through their Hosting Log), give the Host on Duty an IM and ask if he or she knows anything that has gone on.  If that does not produce any results, you would be best served to simply put everyone on pause until I can look over the situation and either give a go ahead or end the scene where it stands.  Again, the players do not like being frozen, but sometimes it is necessary to make sure that no one is getting shafted.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Now that everyone has agreed to your rules, and you are satisfied that everyone is there that is supposed to be there, you'll need their Character Sheets.  Just ask them to send them your way.  If someone has lost their sheet, and cannot find it anywhere then you've got a problem.  Not a big problem...usually.  Often times a member of staff will be online for you to ask for the sheet.  For this reason I find it -VERY- handy to have everyone on the CS Staff to be on my Buddy List.  <BR>
     If no one is on to assist you, well...you've got some choices to make.  You could ask everyone if they would mind if Player X used an NPC sheet, which will be provided to you once you become an ST.  If no one has a problem with that, forward a copy to that player.  You will notice that the NPC sheets are not usually as wonderful as a player's sheet, and for good reason.  That's why the vast majority of the players always know where their sheet is. <BR>
     You can ask the group if they could simply role-play this scene out, due to the lack of a sheet.  Sometimes this method works better than if a fight were to actually occur.  You just never know when the players will surprise you.<BR>
     A last resort to this problem is to put them on pause until the sheet can be located.  This can be done simply by emailing the CS Staff and providing them with the SN of the player that needs the sheet.  I have never known this sort of wait to take more than 12 hours.  But, the dreaded "pause" word has been uttered, and you all know how the players feel about that.<BR>
     Then...then you'll have those times when the player mysteriously cannot find their sheet.  Or they have a "sudden" power outage.  Possibly even their parents are "yelling at them to sign off".  I am always very skeptical about these excuses, as my past experiences have shown me that these are the players that get into fights and then bail to try to save their own hides.  I don't tolerate that sort of nonsense, and I tend to deal with it harshly as I am allowed.  If you ever have a player just up and leave the ST'd event, either because they are angry about a call made by yourself, an action taken by another participant, or they simply refuse to cooperate with you, you are to pause the fight, send me a mailing explaining what happened and the ST Log.  You will probably be asked questions about what happened so that I can better make a judgment on what should be done.  You will always be kept informed of what is transpiring, so that you can have a little bit of insight as to how and why decisions are reached by me.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Now that you have the sheets, it's off to the races!  Assuming that you have already had the players RP up to the point of an Initiative roll, it is time for just that.   I can only assume that because you are reading this that you have some basic understanding of how combat works.  However, for those of you that do not know what to expect from the basic rolling that goes along with these sorts of situations, I will simply include the link for those pages in the rulebook.  Take some time to look this page over, even if you are intimately familiar with our combat system, as some things have changed with the update.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#e51100" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<BR>
Officer on foot			-  6d2 for arrival (6-12 Combat Rounds)<BR>
Officer not on Patrol		-  4d2 for arrival (4-8 Combat Rounds)<BR>

<BR>
The dice can be found at Keyword: Dice.<BR>

<I>Ex:  A horus wolf is trying to roll to not be grappled by someone...the one trying to grapple rolls 2d6+body+attack.  Say the roll is an 8, the attack is a 28 and the body is a 12.  8+12+28=48.  The horus has a body of 12 normally...now +3 = 15.  The Quickness that's normally 22 is now 25 cause of the +3 from the body for horus.  And the roll is an 11.  So we have 11+15+25=51.  The horus wins and is not grappled...note the +3 was added twice.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

Remember Soul is not lost until the mastery is finished, and to watch for masteries that don't take effect until next round.  It's always the next round of the player that cased the spell.  Bonus's don't take effect until then either.  A player going horus round one is not horus until their turn round two...so the +3 to body does not apply in Inits or for any rolls before their turn round two.<BR>

Everything that you have read is the most common of occurrences, the most basic of happenings.  If everything went 100% according to plan in each and every scene that you were called upon to oversee, then we would be finished with this training.  Unfortunately, not every fight/scene is cut and dried for us.  We have to use our heads and our best judgment to run these sorts of events.  Is it always easy?  Of course not, or else everyone would already be an ST, and no one would ever complain.  Is it fun?  It can be, and I always strive to make it so.  Is it rewarding?  On occasion, when the players want you, and only you to run their fights...you can get a great deal of personal satisfaction from knowing that you are doing your job well. <BR>
