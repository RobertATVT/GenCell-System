HOST ANT Hella: 	<waves> 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Ok. Officially, we're starting this thing at 11:00 PM ET,
sans Bizaro... Remind me to crack 
HOST ANT Numb: 	his skull later. :)
HOST ANT Hella: 	OKies, I can do that  :)
HOST ANT Numb: 	Alright. Since you're my first, this is likely to be
disorganized and chaotic. I am already 
HOST ANT Numb: 	aware of my scatterbrained tendencies, but I'm also aware
that you likely don't need much 
HOST ANT Numb: 	re-training, but rather a refresher in new rules, etc. Also
be aware that I recently 
HOST ANT Numb: 	switched computers, and do not have all my old links, text
files, and other cheat sheets
HOST ANT Numb: 	handy, so this is sort of a fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants type
deal. 
HOST ANT Hella: 	Welp, I don't mind.  I've changed puter too in the last
month so I know the deal. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Ok. Why don't we start by you telling me what an ST is
expected to do.
HOST ANT Hella: 	OKies, well...pretty much as ST is the catch all for
everything that can happen on line from
HOST ANT Hella: 	fights to player questions when the top dogs aren't on line,
to watching rolls and such that
HOST ANT Hella: 	the hosts can't handle.  I'm not sure if all the hosts are
allowed to watch rolls done in 
HOST ANT Hella: 	the room or not - so pretty much being backup for those. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	That's actually a very good answer. ST means Story Teller, so
that is our primary job - but 
HOST ANT Numb: 	we also get to be mediators for players who can be, at times,
the worst headache you'll 
HOST ANT Numb: 	ever have. I look at it as a cross between reffing a pee-wee
football game and telling story
HOST ANT Numb: 	time to little kids - you can look at it other ways, that's
up to you. 
HOST ANT Hella: 	<g>
HOST ANT Numb: 	;)  Ok, tell me, in your own words, step by step, what you do
when asked to ST. (This is the
HOST ANT Numb: 	short part of the refresher, afterwards I grill you for
information. :)
HOST ANT Hella: 	Hrm.  First thing is to find out who all is involved, and
normally that happens by either 
HOST ANT Hella: 	talking to the room host, or the players involved.  Collect
those folks and take them to a 
HOST ANT Hella: 	handy dandy PR.  Erm, next I would ask them if this is a
fight scene, that I'll need sheets
HOST ANT Hella: 	for or if it's a simple RP deal that has to be watched.  If
it's a sheet deal, I'll ask for 
HOST ANT Hella: 	those to be mailed to me - so that I can find out that
everyone has a current sheet. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	How do you spot a faked sheet?
HOST ANT Hella: 	Sheest have to have a staff signature on them - or be
forwarded right from the original mail
HOST ANT Hella: 	that was sent to the player. 
HOST ANT Hella: 	Pardon my typos. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Good. I also take a moment to check out their XP totals at
the bottom, sometimes that can 
HOST ANT Numb: 	let me know if someone has been modifying without permission.
Don't worry about typoes, 
HOST ANT Numb: 	I'll be making a few of my own. So if this is a non-combat
scene, what to do then?
HOST ANT Hella: 	Erm, I would ask the person that started the freeze exactly
what the deal is and why we are 
HOST ANT Numb: 	I just realized how vague that question was. Let me clarify.
:D
HOST ANT Hella: 	here, then go down and ask all the others if that jives with
them as well. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	If this was a scene that normally, would not require rolls,
what's expected of the ST?
HOST ANT Hella: 	Welp, pretty much playing ref and making sure that it
doesn't get to the point that it does
HOST ANT Hella: 	or should involve rolls. 
HOST ANT Hella: 	Hiya, Savant. :)
HOST ANT Numb: 	And another good answer. You're going to make this easy on
me, good. ;)
HOST ANT Numb: 	Welcome, Savant. We were just getting started. 
HOST ANT Hella: 	Oh, something else that I've done, when it's a non combat
thing - is still ask the players 
HOST ANT Hella: 	to roll dice - with no mods added, so that they are RPing in
an order that I can 
HOST ANT Hella: 	watch so they're not typing all over eachother - makes it
easier for me and the other 
HOST ANT Hella: 	players in the scene to see - sort of like getting an order
going just so it's clear for 
HOST ANT Hella: 	everyone. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	If it's a semi-non-combat scene, that's a good technique.
I'll often just have them roll 
HOST ANT Numb: 	inits, as that holds true to the idea of having a CS.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Ok, once we've actually verified the sheets, verified that we
-need- to be present to 
HOST ANT Numb: 	witness this scene, and verified that everyone who's supposed
to be there is, what next? A 
HOST ANT Numb: 	hint - this is THE most imprtant thing to do. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Savant.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Bitch out all the player's that think if the ST doesn't
make calls their way they must be 
HOST ANT Savant: 	inexperienced by reading them the rules?
HOST ANT Hella: 	<blinks some>
HOST ANT Numb: 	Not the answer I was looking for...
HOST ANT Hella: 	Or pop off line and call in a pizza?
HOST ANT Savant: 	Eh, it was sarcastic for reading the rules.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Particuliar the one about not arguing with the ST.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Not if you have a cable modem. ;)  Frees up your phone line.
No, the answer I was looking 
HOST ANT Numb: 	for....
HOST ANT Numb: 	<dramatic pause> 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Set the scene.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Set the scene?  I thought that was part of verifying that
we need to be there.
HOST ANT Numb: 	This is the single most important thing to do. Get where
people are standing in your head, 
HOST ANT Savant: 	At least I seem to take care of both at the same time when
I do it, figuring out the scene 
HOST ANT Savant: 	and seeing why I'm there through it.
HOST ANT Numb: 	where the cars are, where the barstool is, what kind of
lighting there is, etc etc.
HOST ANT Numb: 	True, Savant, but we're taking these one step at a time. So,
yes, the scene is most 
HOST ANT Numb: 	important. State it to the players, ask them all if the agree
- and make sure they type yes 
HOST ANT Numb: 	in the room. It will save appeals later.
HOST ANT Numb: 	(They, not the. I told you I would be typoing.)
HOST ANT Numb: 	After that, it's rules time, right? Do you both have the
standard ST rules?
HOST ANT Hella: 	<nods> 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Right, I just thought that'd already been covered since you
were talking about noncombat 
HOST ANT Savant: 	scenes and after verifying the scene.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Of course, like, five copies.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Heehee, I do as well, with one special rule added in. It's
not standard, but hey, it's a 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Although the 6th rule Storm and I made got cut out. :-(
HOST ANT Numb: 	good one. Rule #6) There will be no stalling. If it is
determined that you are stalling, 
HOST ANT Numb: 	you will be skipped. ( I set the groundrules early, and
stalling is one thing I don't 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Aww, that wasn't our sixth rule.
HOST ANT Numb: 	tolerate - rather than get frustrated at it, I let the
players know that these ST scenes 
HOST ANT Numb: 	will run smoothly and quickly. You don't have to use that
rule, but I find it's been VERY 
HOST ANT Numb: 	useful.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Heh, ours was. 6) The STs are NOT here to help you decide
character actions by telling you 
HOST ANT Savant: 	the pros and cons systemwise of any action you might take
in a round and letting you choose 
HOST ANT Savant: 	the best result.  You must RP your action first before I
will tell you the system effects.
HOST ANT Numb: 	That's actually very close to my no stalling rule... and also
a good one to use.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Any questions before we dive into the meat of combat?
HOST ANT Savant: 	( Cause we saw that as a form of OOC manip...)
HOST ANT Hella: 	Newp
HOST ANT Savant: 	Naw, not here long enough yet.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Okay, first question: What special modifier would you use if
it was a clear night, on the 
HOST ANT Numb: 	beach, with a full moon out?
HOST ANT Numb: 	Hella.
HOST ANT Hella: 	Ah...none?  Why would you need a mod for an action if the
players can all see what's going 
HOST ANT Hella: 	on and around them?
HOST ANT Savant: 	<Taps chin>
HOST ANT Hella: 	Or you mean Inits?
HOST ANT Numb: 	Savant, your opinion?
HOST ANT Numb: 	I mean modifiers due to lighting.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Only moonlight is medium obscurity, -4 attack and inits,
though most STs forget about it.
HOST ANT Numb: 	If my questions are vague, by all means, ask me to clarify. 
HOST ANT Savant: 	I got it, its just not often used.
HOST ANT Numb: 	It's still not as lit as daylight, but it is the full moon,
so in this case it would 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Especially since the parking lot is considered well lit for
some reason.
HOST ANT Hella: 	<grins> We've got night big bright full moons here in
Kansas, I wasn't thinking of 
HOST ANT Hella: 	vision penalties for that. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	qualify as 'just after dusk (no light)'. so that would give a
-2 to attack and dodge for non
HOST ANT Numb: 	night visioned individuals.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Hmm...
HOST ANT Numb: 	That is the way I would call it, you may call it differently,
but if you do - have reasons 
HOST ANT Numb: 	behind your decision. Players -will- ask for them.
HOST ANT Savant: 	"Just" after dusk you can still see a fair distance,
moonlight, even a full moon here as 
HOST ANT Savant: 	this night was, you still don't get as much detail... I
guess it depends on how "just" you 
HOST ANT Savant: 	consider it...
HOST ANT Numb: 	Exactly, there's room to move in either direction, but as the
ST you have to make a call and
HOST ANT Numb: 	make it with conviction, but make sure it's reasonable. When
you're the ST, whatever you 
HOST ANT Numb: 	say, goes. Whatever you say. Sure, there might be an appeal,
but for the purposes of that PR
HOST ANT Numb: 	, you ARE the law. I see a lot of waffling in new ST's, and
it can't be there. If you're 
HOST ANT Numb: 	wrong on a call, admit it, suck it up, carry on... But make
your decisions fairly, and you 
HOST ANT Numb: 	shouldn't have a problem with people disputing you (most of
the time).
HOST ANT Savant: 	Eh, I say that most has been debateble recently.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Downgrade it to some.
HOST ANT Savant: 	<g>
HOST ANT Numb: 	The purpose of this re-training is to upgrade it to 'all'. :)
HOST ANT Numb: 	which is impossible, but anyway...
HOST ANT Savant: 	No, they've been appealing because of the results on most
of my most recent STs, not on any 
HOST ANT Savant: 	calls I made.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Savant, what about a character fighting while in handcuffs?
Any modifier changes?
HOST ANT Numb: 	You won't find it in the rulebook. ;)
HOST ANT Savant: 	Well, you could classify it as similar to being tied up
which is a -6 to defense, but you 
HOST ANT Savant: 	still got your legs... 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Not exactly, only similar things.
HOST ANT Numb: 	The precedence has been set to -2 to attack and dodge. This
is one I'm making sure everyone 
HOST ANT Numb: 	knows. -6 is for completely tied up... as in, straighjacket
and mermaid tail.
HOST ANT Savant: 	-6 is also for held...
HOST ANT Numb: 	Unable to move freely... can you move freely while in
handcuffs? Yes. If it were leg irons, 
HOST ANT Numb: 	handcuffs, and a waist chain, then we're talking -6.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Held, restrained, tied up... <shrugs> I've only seen it
apply to trying to use your arms in 
HOST ANT Savant: 	an ST with Bear, otherwise there was no penalty to dodging
and running away.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Which is a good interpretation, but we're going for
conformity here. -2 to attack and dodge.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Moving on. Inits, the first and easiest roll of the game. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	What happens if there are 5 players, A, B, C, D and Andy God.
Andy God and D tie, beating 
HOST ANT Numb: 	out A and B, but not C. What happens? Hella?
HOST ANT Numb: 	So the order as it stands is... C, [Andy God <--> D], A, B.
HOST ANT Hella: 	Have Andy and D roll over, then put it in order from C to
whoever won, then lost the tie, 
HOST ANT Hella: 	A and B in their order.  Then tell Andy it's his turn.
<nods> 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Bingo. ::tosses virtual candy:: Name the order in room, also
write it on a pad next to your 
HOST ANT Numb: 	keyboard. I can't tell you how many times I've been punted,
then had to search the log. So 
HOST ANT Numb: 	paper, plain old paper, is very helpful in keeping track
(especially when you're in a 7, 8, 
HOST ANT Numb: 	15 person fight).
HOST ANT Numb: 	I'm certain you all know the basic rules of combat. Attack,
dodge, damage... all very simple
HOST ANT Numb: 	and nothing has changed in the past 2 years (at least). 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Savant: Yes or no. Do you know the system for Accelerated
Healing?
HOST ANT Savant: 	Yes?
HOST ANT Numb: 	Sly dog, you... 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Ack, period.
HOST ANT Numb: 	No, you probably don't know it off the top of your head. I
don't. But I do know where to 
HOST ANT Numb: 	look for it. Bookmark some key spots in the rulebook for easy
reference, and you'll always 
HOST ANT Numb: 	look like you know the answer immediately (hey, how do you
think I survived as Systems 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Coordinator this long? I can sure coordinate a system... )
HOST ANT Savant: 	Heh, ok, I didn't know it ended play for the night, other
than that.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Hmm... What else am I missing.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Is any one of us too proud to ask for another ST's opinion?
HOST ANT Numb: 	Except me, of course. :)
HOST ANT Hella: 	Newp, don't think so, least I'm not.  
HOST ANT Numb: 	(that was a joke for the humor challenged) I ask ST's their
opinion often when I'm running a
HOST ANT Savant: 	Nope, tough calls not in rulebook then better to have alien
thoughts on the matter floating 
HOST ANT Savant: 	around in your head.
HOST ANT Hella: 	I haven't done this in awhile, so you'll prolly get
questions galore from me. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	scene, especially when players ask to do something
unorthodox.
HOST ANT Numb: 	That's what I'm here for, Hella. Is there anything you're
kinda fuzzy on?
HOST ANT Hella: 	I'm prolly fuzzy on all of the masterys and all, and some of
the penalties and such
HOST ANT Hella: 	but it's nothing that I can't link and read up on. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	That gets easier with time - a lot of masteries have changes.
Don't trust the version you 
HOST ANT Numb: 	read in the players CS - get the online one.
HOST ANT Numb: 	(changed... not changes. bah)
HOST ANT Hella: 	<nods some> 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Savant - Do we, as ST's, have power to open the sky and drop
a lightning bolt on an annoying
HOST ANT Numb: 	characters ass?
HOST ANT Savant: 	Much to our dismay, no.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Actually, we do - it'd be appealed, but we do. That was an
exaggeration, but let me give you
HOST ANT Numb: 	a real example.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Well, we do if we don't care about fairness or our position
as STs.
HOST ANT Numb: 	I was STing for some newer players, and one decided to join
the fight by leaping from the 
HOST ANT Numb: 	drivers seat of his jeep, which happened to be travelling at
60 mph. 
HOST ANT Savant: 	That'd be a hard athletics roll to land.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Needless to say, I enforced an Athletics roll vs a TN of 26.
The only way he could make it 
HOST ANT Savant: 	<g> Take damage if missed.
HOST ANT Numb: 	was double sixes, I let him know that if he did not make the
roll, his character would 
HOST ANT Numb: 	suffer 4 damage AND break at least one leg. If he missed the
roll by 10 or more, 2 legs.
HOST ANT Numb: 	That was appealed and did stand up in appeal. So my point is
this - if something feels like 
HOST ANT Numb: 	it should fit... do it. Whats stopping you? 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Nothing, within reason.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Bingo. ::tosses virtual candy:: Wrapping up the fight is
simple. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	You should have been logging (obviously), and you will send
that log in to:
HOST ANT Numb: 	HOST ANT Pagan, Chai, Paradox, Lycaon (if he's still around)
HOST ANT Numb: 	That's the current list, subject to change.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Everyone knows how to NPC police officers and EMT's?
HOST ANT Numb: 	An important thing with NPC cops... They're not heroes. Most
of the time they call for 
HOST ANT Numb: 	backup and hide from anything ugly, hairy, or scaly.
Remember, these guys are just Joe's
HOST ANT Numb: 	with a wife and 2.3 kids at home. NPC EMT's are the same way
- they're not meant to run -up-
HOST ANT Numb: 	to rampaging Horus' and try to taser it. I've seen that done
and only had to roll my eyes at
HOST ANT Numb: 	it.
HOST ANT Hella: 	4 2D6, add that together and it's the round they come in on
from the round you are on then, 
HOST ANT Hella: 	right?
HOST ANT Hella: 	No, 4 2 siders, I mean. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Your second one is correct. :)
HOST ANT Hella: 	Okies
HOST ANT Numb: 	use keyword: Dice to rolle 2 sides dice.
HOST ANT Numb: 	I can't think of anything else. Does anyone have any
questions before I stamp you?
HOST ANT Numb: 	(I'm not sure if Paradox wants you guys to sit in on a real
ST scene yet, but I'll discuss 
HOST ANT Numb: 	that with him later)
HOST ANT Hella: 	Not that I can think of, I just have some reading to do, is
all.
HOST ANT Numb: 	::nods:: You do a lot of it... even after years of doing
this. Savant, got anything to say 
HOST ANT Numb: 	before I wrap this up?
HOST ANT Savant: 	Did I miss anything important?
HOST ANT Numb: 	Nope, I'll send you both the log, though.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Then, guess not.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Alright. I'll be following up with you guys later. Hella, -1
point for not reminding me to 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Only I hope some of these pet rules you're trying to
standardize get into the rulebook.
HOST ANT Numb: 	crack Bizaro's skull.
HOST ANT Savant: 	Hey Numb?
HOST ANT Numb: 	Yeeeeees?
HOST ANT Savant: 	Crack Bizaro's skull.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Savant gets a bonus point
HOST ANT Numb: 	!
HOST ANT Hella: 	You didn't say -when- I had to remind you, so there. 
HOST ANT Savant: 	Swish!
HOST ANT Numb: 	::tosses virtual candy all around:: Ok, I forgive you Hella. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Now get out of here and have some fun. :)
HOST ANT Hella: 	Oh joy.
HOST ANT Hella: 	<scampers>
