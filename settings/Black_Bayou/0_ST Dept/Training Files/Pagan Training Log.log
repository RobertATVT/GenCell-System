HOST ANT Pagan: 	<Malcolm> Hey! You don't have a badge! Ouch!
Victor A Martel: 	Are we ready to get this show on the road?
Dpty Rya Winter: 	Sure.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	Ayup.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	Wait!
HOST ANT Pagan: 	Ok . . didn't log. 
HOST ANT Pagan: 	Ok -- welcome to my Grove. This would be the part where I
ask you to send me your CS, but I 
HOST ANT Pagan: 	have them. <g> Would you like to set the scene for us
Victor?
Victor A Martel: 	Yeah, Rya and Vic were sitting in the dojo chatting and as
usual it came down to a contest ~
Victor A Martel: 	of intestinal foritude... Vic and Rya have always had this
competition thing going and this~
Victor A Martel: 	time we decided to let it come to blows... nothing deadly
and no killing, but we fully ~
Victor A Martel: 	plan on beating each others butts soundly.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	All righty -- is this everyone that is supposed to be here?
Dpty Rya Winter: 	Yup.  It's a friend matter, not a pack matter.
Victor A Martel: 	Ayup... just friendly competition
HOST ANT Pagan: 	Ok -- I'm fairly familiar with the Dojo in that I know there
won't be any penalties for 
HOST ANT Pagan: 	sparring there. [sight, weather, etc.] Just a sec while I
review the CS's.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	Ok . . now the rules.  ::smiles:: . . . . please take notes.

HOST ANT Pagan: 	1] No OOC once the scene has begun.  Each OOC comment after
the first warning has been 
HOST ANT Pagan: 	given will cause the player to recieve a -1 to *all* rolls
for the remainder of the scene.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	2] If you have a question or need something, type (Pause)
and IM me.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	3] Do not argue with me.  If you feel that I have made an
error, show me in the Rulebook.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	4] If you feel any or all of my descisions are wrong, you
have 48 hours to appeal to 
HOST ANT Pagan: 	ANT BB Mail.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	5] Someone may die in this session . . prolly Victor.
::snickers::
HOST ANT Pagan: 	6] Do you all agree to thses rules?
Victor A Martel: 	Yup
Dpty Rya Winter: 	yes
HOST ANT Pagan: 	Ok then -- here's an addendum to the rules -- I call it
Pagan's Law.
HOST ANT Pagan: 	I don't mind a little OOC, but don't get carried away. Is
that kosher?
Dpty Rya Winter: 	Sure.
Victor A Martel: 	I suppose... I can live with that <G>
HOST ANT Pagan: 	Good, good. Then let the RP begin. #Pause when it's time for
Inits. <g>

there was one--and having long

Victor A Martel: 	Then let's get it on...   You know you've been waiting to
