 #4) What will you name your ST log if you ST'd a fight on 3/28/99 at 5:21pm?<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> 032899Sal1 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(032899st1Sal.log, but this is close enough for me. )</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 #5) What's the TN to carry a person?<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>That would depend on who was lifting who. A smaller person would have a harder time lifiting a large man. Such as Beth whos is 5'4 lifiing Victor.. The TN would be in the difficult range... 24 or so.. where as the other way around, it would be a lot lower.12 - 15 as Beth is only about 90 pounds.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(When you are listing a TN you should also list the roll that must be made to make that TN. Here's what I would give.<BR>
2d6 + Body vs TN 8 for someone who weighs less that 100 pounds.<BR>
TN 10 for someone who's >100 lbs but <150 lbs.<BR>
TN 12 for someone who's >150 lbs but <200 lbs<BR>
And so forth. (TN 18 for someone who weighs 325 pounds - it makes sense for someone with a body of 11 to be able to do that half the time.) Carrying someone should not depend on the carryer's size - Andy Briggs is only 5'10" but has a body of 15 - do not penalize people for roleplaying small characters. Also, make your TN's keeping the newer sheet in mind. Could a normal person carry a normal person? Yes. List the TN keeping that in mind.) </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 #6)  What's the TN To kick down a steel rimmed wodden door?<BR>
 TN</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">12 (10 for the door a +2 for the rimming) </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Good call. ;)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"><BR>
 #7) Two people are fighting in the woods, it's overcast and the ground is wet.  On top of all that it's getting to be around Dusk.  What Penalties would they have?<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B><I>Slight Obscurity: </B></I>(just after dusk (no light); light rain) -2 to Attack and Dodge<BR>
 <B><I>Medium Cover</B></I>	(hiding behind a tree - partially exposed) +4 to Dodge <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>( Ok, Slight Obscurity is a good call. The ground being wet is a moot point - the ground is wet for both characters and it affects them both equally, attacking and dodging. There would be no 'Medium Cover' bonuses - are they hiding behind a tree when fighting? Unless they roleplay that they are hiding behind a tree, or they are at long ranges, then this should not be a consideration. )</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"><BR>
 #8) Same as above, but it's winter and the ground is heavily iced over?<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">I would have to say there wouldn't be anything added because they all would be at the same disadvantage. Just would have to watch the masteries and things of that nature that might be effected by this... </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(This is an excellent call. If someone has roleplayed that they have special equipment, for example crampons or snowshoes, then you can assign a mild penalty to the other character. I would say -2 to attack and dodge should be sufficient.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"><BR>

 #9) A Vampire is standing 6 feet from another PC and wishes to use Hypnosis, the other character has their back to him/her.  What does the vampire have to do in order to use the mastery?<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>First all they have to touch the person and then roll if there is no eye contact stated, there must be a forced eye contact roll(</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> 2d6+Mind vs. victim's 2d6+Body) then the roll for the mastery. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Hypnotic Suggestion does not require touch to work. Please re-read any Mastery before you make a call on it - there's an awful lot of them and I wouldn't expect you to know them all off the top of your head. Forced Eye Contact is required, though, and the roll you listed is the correct one.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"><BR>

 #10) Can non Active CS's take part in an ST'd event?  If so under what circumstances?<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">Yes as long as the ST can locate a copy of the last approved CS for the player and he/she agrees to use that one or the use of an NPC sheet.Another option is to have me online to get the sheet approved for the fight <eg> Other wise you would ask if they wish to RP out the scene without the ST. Failing that, the scene is frozen until a sheet can be reactivated or a judgment by the big boys...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(A CS is only active for 2 months, after which time... it is not active and cannot be used. If a character does not -have- an approved CS from the past two months then he cannot use that CS. Why is this? Say, two and a half years ago, a character was killed. No one on staff currently online remembers this character was killed off the top of their heads, but suddenly the character is around and wanting to play a CS with 12 12 12 stats. It has happened before. During the approval process (which usually goes to Savant), the oldies are asked... and sometimes we re-approved the CS, sometimes not. But a character MUST have an active CS to roll any skills in an ST'ed event - if someone doesn't, then it is an automatic appeal. The -only- instance in which this would be acceptable is if the character is merely an observer, and does not attack or defend in the entire course of the fight.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>>><BR>
We're going to have another session next Saturday at 9:00 PM if you can make it, but we need a little more refresher activity before you can be re-instated as an ST. <BR>
