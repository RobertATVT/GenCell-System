#1) If a group of players just entered into a Pause and a PC Police Officer begins RPing their Patrol what Response time do they use?<BR>
<BR>
<I>2-4 combat rounds from the round they were called, if I read it correctly.</I><BR>
<BR>
#2) Modify these Statistics and Modifiers to reflect a Vampire going into Bat Form:<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>#3) What Fighting Style can be used to assist in Grappling an opponent?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Never heard that any did. If one did, I'd say wrestling, as the skill is known its holds.</I><BR>
<BR>
#4) What will you name your ST log if you ST'd a fight on 3/28/99 at 5:21pm?<BR>
<BR>
<I>032899st1Sei (assuming it's my first of the day)</I><BR>
<BR>
#5) What's the TN to carry a person?<BR>
<BR>
<I>I'd say 16 to 24, depending on the relative size of the people, and whether or not the person being carried is struggling.</I><BR>
<BR>
#6)  What's the TN To kick down a steel rimmed wooden door?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Solid wood or thin metal... 10 or 14, maybe compromise and say 12.</I><BR>
<BR>
#7) Two people are fighting in the woods, it's overcast and the ground is wet.  On top of all that it's getting to be around Dusk.  What Penalties would they have?<BR>
<BR>
<I>-4 attack and dodge for the visibility and -1 or -2 for the wet ground, although that's not listed.</I><BR>
<BR>
#8) Same as above, but it's winter and the ground is heavily iced over?<BR>
<BR>
<I>In southern Louisiana? That'd be strange. Hm. Same attack/dodge bonus, but -2 or -3 for the icy ground, as that's almost worse footing for the unwary than simple damp ground.</I><BR>
<BR>
#9) A Vampire is standing 6 feet from another PC and wishes to use Hypnosis, the other character has their back to him/her.  What does the vampire have to do in order to use the mastery?<BR>
<BR>
<I>Get them to turn around, or otherwise get into position for forced eye contact.</I><BR>
<BR>
#10) Can non Active CS's take part in an ST'd event?  If so under what circumstances?<BR>
<BR>
<I>As in new players that don't have an approved sheet? Yes, according to the trainer, although it's not usually a good idea. I don't recall it saying, but I would assume they would use the NPC sheet mentioned with the older players who might not be able to find their sheets.</I><BR>
<BR>
#11) A Werewolf is using Scent Recognition and fails the first roll.  Can they use the mastery again to get a second try?  If they can what are the penalties to that second roll.  Is there a third try?  What modifiers can be put onto the use of Scent recognition?<BR>
<BR>
<I>They can try as many times as they have soul to spend. I've only heard that there is a penalty to skills attempted more than once per night, never masteries. As for the last question, I can't understand what it's asking me to answer it. If it's asking what the roll is, there are no modifiers, it's a stat vs. stat roll. If it's asking what's affected by its use (failed or otherwise), quickness, initiative, dodge and will.</I></HTML>
