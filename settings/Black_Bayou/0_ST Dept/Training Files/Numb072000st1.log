HOST ANT Numb: 	Time: 10:07 PM.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Welcome. :)
HOST ANT Numb: 	Give me a minute to clean some of my windows up and we'll
start.
HOST ANT Salem: 	Okies
HOST ANT Salem: 	I haven't even got the kids dinner yet anyway... I just got
out of the room
HOST ANT Numb: 	Whenever you're ready, just let me know.
HOST ANT Salem: 	Okay.. I'm here for a sec.. <g>
HOST ANT Numb: 	Alright. Lets get this thing rolling.
HOST ANT Numb: 	First thing you will need to know: When is an ST required?
HOST ANT Numb: 	Whenever there is a contested roll, or whenever there is
combat where the outcome is 
HOST ANT Numb: 	uncertain, an ST is required to monitor the proceedings and
to make sure the pre-set rules 
HOST ANT Numb: 	of game combat are adhered to.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Everything groovy on that?
HOST ANT Salem: 	Yeppers
HOST ANT Numb: 	Ok. I won't go over the ST Training 101 that I sent you
earlier, as you should have read 
HOST ANT Salem: 	I read also when Paradox sent it
HOST ANT Numb: 	that and understood it all by this point. Do you have any
questions on anything in that 
HOST ANT Numb: 	sheet? Anything at all?
HOST ANT Salem: 	nope..
HOST ANT Numb: 	Alright. Then I'll set it up as if you were called to ST a
scene. Pretend you're just coming
HOST ANT Numb: 	into the room, and all the HOST has told you is that you are
needed for a scene.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Take it away. :)
HOST ANT Salem: 	(feels like a kid in speech class now)
HOST ANT Numb: 	What do you do, first thing, when coming into a paused scene
main room?
HOST ANT Numb: 	You gather everyone who is paused in IM's.
HOST ANT Salem: 	First off I would find out who is involved and a good idea
of why they are paused from the
HOST ANT Salem: 	host or one of the players involved.. then I would ask for
allpaused to IM me<g>
HOST ANT Numb: 	What -I- do is this. I make an announcement. ( Everyone who
is involved with Big Joe, please
HOST ANT Numb: 	IM me now. )
HOST ANT Numb: 	I ask everyone who IM's me the same questions (copy and paste
works wonders).
HOST ANT Numb: 	Whats happening? Why are you paused? Who else is there? 
HOST ANT Numb: 	If someone is not being entirely truthful, we can take it
from there, but usually you get a 
HOST ANT Numb: 	lot ironed out in those first few minutes.
HOST ANT Numb: 	After you get everyone in IM's, and have a good idea as to
what is happening, and you have 
HOST ANT Numb: 	verified that you are, in fact, needed, what's your next
step?
HOST ANT Salem: 	A PR linked to all involved
HOST ANT Numb: 	First, I would ask for the Character Sheets for everyone to
be mailed to me. The PR and the
HOST ANT Numb: 	CS's can often be interchanged, but if somebody does not have
a CS, I usually suggest to the
HOST ANT Numb: 	players that they may have more fun if they roleplayed the
fight out.
HOST ANT Salem: 	(I have the CS's)
HOST ANT Numb: 	Ok. We've got CS's and a Private Room. (Oh, I know... not
everyone is lucky enough to have 
HOST ANT Numb: 	all the CS's on disk. :D  )
HOST ANT Salem: 	I pull the sheets before the PR and then see that I get the
one's I don't have
HOST ANT Numb: 	Take a look at your mailbox. You should see an e-mail I sent
you a little earlier. "Big 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Joe's CS" is the subject line. What would you do after
receiving this CS along with the 
HOST ANT Numb: 	others?
HOST ANT Salem: 	I would IM him and as if he has an approved one..
HOST ANT Numb: 	"But that one was approved!" he claims.
HOST ANT Salem: 	I then explain the process by which a CS is approved
HOST ANT Numb: 	"I can't believe this bull[   ]!!! I know COMA! I'll get you
fired!!"
HOST ANT Numb: 	(Believe me, players like this do exist.)
HOST ANT Salem: 	I know.. I smile :) and give him coma's SN
HOST ANT Numb: 	Excellent call. The CS I sent you was a faked CS. What tipped
you off to it?
HOST ANT Salem: 	first off, no stamp.. and then the breed being a lawyer..
with  we all know they are a breed
HOST ANT Salem: 	all there own, but not in the BB
HOST ANT Numb: 	Right. What about near the bottom?
HOST ANT Salem: 	no purchase listing
HOST ANT Numb: 	Exactly. There is no XP record listed. That doesn't
necessarily make a CS invalid, but it is
HOST ANT Numb: 	one of many clues.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Ok, assuming every CS -is- valid, what is the next step?
HOST ANT Salem: 	I ask each player in turn their point of view.. where they
are sstanding, sitting Ect..Each 
HOST ANT Salem: 	setting up the scene
HOST ANT Numb: 	Excellent. Sometimes I like to cut out the middle man by
asking the most experienced mun 
HOST ANT Salem: 	I use to..Paradox said no
HOST ANT Numb: 	what he thinks has happened, and ask the other players if
they have anything to add/refute.
HOST ANT Salem: 	::nods:: as I have always done.. it's the best way I think
HOST ANT Numb: 	Paradox may have a point, but when you're in the trenches,
you'll see what is acceptable and
HOST ANT Salem: 	Takes less time and the players get less grumpy
HOST ANT Numb: 	what is not. Cutting time off of pre-setup is always a good
thing.
HOST ANT Salem: 	(I was an ST for al ong time)
HOST ANT Numb: 	After you have a good mental picture of what the scene is...
where everyone is located, what
HOST ANT Numb: 	the lighting is like, is it raining? are crickets chirping?
what does the air taste like? (I
HOST ANT Numb: 	know it sounds cheesy, but if -you- get into the right mood,
then the players will too.), 
HOST ANT Numb: 	What is it then time for? I'll give you a hint - There are 5
basic ones, but I've been known
HOST ANT Numb: 	to add a special one if the situation demands it.
HOST ANT Salem: 	Well, first off I tell then the scene as I see it and ask
that everyone agrees
HOST ANT Numb: 	( Right, that should have been taken care of while asking the
players what's happening... 
HOST ANT Numb: 	building a mental picture takes feedback. )
HOST ANT Salem: 	Then run the rules
HOST ANT Numb: 	Bingo. Do you have a copy of them on disk?
HOST ANT Salem: 	Yep
HOST ANT Numb: 	Excellent. Thats all I need to know. Just keep in mind that
the rules are not there to 
HOST ANT Salem: 	You want ,e to run them?
HOST ANT Numb: 	frighten or bully the players into submission, but rather to
set guidelines. If you really 
HOST ANT Numb: 	dislike OOC in your sessions (I happen to hate OOC in my
sessions), then let the players 
HOST ANT Numb: 	know up front. Be honest, be fair, be stern... but most
important, be the nice guy rather 
HOST ANT Numb: 	than the asshole. ( I can say that, this is a PR. ;)
HOST ANT Numb: 	Ok. After the rules have been gone over and everyone has
agreed... 
HOST ANT Salem: 	Then we start with inits for round 1
HOST ANT Numb: 	We start combat. This is where the bulk of tonights training
will be, but unfortunately I 
HOST ANT Numb: 	can't cover even one percent of what you will see as an ST.
Players will ALWAYS try new and 
HOST ANT Numb: 	unusual ways of fighting. In those cases, I always refer to
the cheat sheet at the bottom of
HOST ANT Numb: 	  Combat In The Bayou (Keyword to:
aol://4344:1192.combat.9390616.578715410) 
HOST ANT Salem: 	Have it in my favorite places
HOST ANT Numb: 	It's a real life saver. ::nods:: You can always point to that
as an explanation if someone 
HOST ANT Numb: 	asks you 'why' you set a particular TN so high, or so low.
HOST ANT Salem: 	I always copy and past that into the IM as I set it
HOST ANT Numb: 	Excellent. :)
HOST ANT Numb: 	You will run combat as normal. Since you have been an ST
before, I am confident you know how
HOST ANT Numb: 	to do inits, basic attack and dodge, and mastery usage. 
HOST ANT Salem: 	::nods:: 
HOST ANT Numb: 	I will now throw some odd situations your way and see what
answers you come up with.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Say a Horus wishes to rip the door off a 1995 Chevy Cavalier.
What kind of roll would that 
HOST ANT Numb: 	be?
HOST ANT Numb: 	The door is already open, he merely wishes to rip it off.
HOST ANT Numb: 	::coughhintcombatinthebayoucoughhint::
HOST ANT Salem: 	TN 18... 
HOST ANT Numb: 	What roll?
HOST ANT Salem: 	Body roll
HOST ANT Numb: 	I would put the roll at 2d6+Body vs TN 20. Since it is a
moderately difficult task.
HOST ANT Numb: 	But TN 18 is also perfectly acceptable.
HOST ANT Salem: 	Well in Horus , they are stronger
HOST ANT Salem: 	or should be
HOST ANT Numb: 	That's already expressed in the +3 to their Body. ;)
HOST ANT Numb: 	Say a man wearing handcuffs tries to jump onto the back of a
moving pickup truck. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Whats the roll for that?
HOST ANT Salem: 	Body + athletics
HOST ANT Numb: 	To give further information - he is free and chasing down the
pickup. The driver of the 
HOST ANT Numb: 	pickup knows he is trying to board the truck and is helping
him do so. Very good, what is 
HOST ANT Numb: 	the target number?
HOST ANT Salem: 	I would say 16
HOST ANT Numb: 	Consider a pickup bed is about 4 feet off the ground... but
the bed is also moving.
HOST ANT Numb: 	I would set the TN at 20. What about the handcuffs?
HOST ANT Salem: 	There would be a -6 to his dodge.. I would think maybe a -
to his roll to get on the truck t
HOST ANT Salem: 	o
HOST ANT Numb: 	Handcuffs only subtract 2 from a characters dodge. And is he
really using his hands that 
HOST ANT Numb: 	much when hopping onto the back of a moving truck? Not much.
The handcuffs were a ruse, 
HOST ANT Numb: 	meant to fool you, which it seems they have. ;)  No throwing
rotten fruit, please. :D
HOST ANT Salem: 	Immobilization: Any time that a character is held,
restrained, tied up or
HOST ANT Salem: 	otherwise unable to move freely, they are considered to be
immobilized. 
HOST ANT Salem: 	 All dodge attempts made by an immobilized character are at
-6 to the defensive roll.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Key words in that statement: Unable to move freely. Should
this character have handcuffs, 
HOST ANT Numb: 	leg irons, and a shackled waist with a thirty pound iron ball
on his ankle, then yes, he is 
HOST ANT Numb: 	considered immobile. Simple handcuffs are a mere -2.
HOST ANT Salem: 	Okies
HOST ANT Numb: 	This is why we have these trainings, to smooth out
discrepancies in our perceptions of the 
HOST ANT Numb: 	rules. That confusion right there is a successful appeal. 
HOST ANT Numb: 	What's the penalty to any rolls for a Mortal fighting in a
room without lighting?
HOST ANT Salem: 	(BRB,, gotta kill kids))
HOST ANT Numb: 	Ok. Time for a smoke break anyway. We'll re-convene in five.

HOST ANT Numb: 	Class is back in session. :)  You with me?
HOST ANT Salem: 	Yep, sorry they managed to squirt water through the window
and all over the puter
HOST ANT Numb: 	Heh. Gotta love kids. ;)
HOST ANT Numb: 	What's the penalty to any rolls for a Mortal fighting in a
room without lighting?
HOST ANT Salem: 	No lightling?
HOST ANT Numb: 	Zero lighting. Pitch black.
HOST ANT Salem: 	-6 to dodge and atack
HOST ANT Numb: 	Very good. 
HOST ANT Salem: 	even if I can't spell <g>
HOST ANT Numb: 	Hmm.. ::thinks:: What if I were a Mortal becoming a Ghoul?
How is that rolled out?
HOST ANT Numb: 	I understand most of these do not come up often, but you need
to know where to find them. BR
HOST ANT Numb: 	BRB
HOST ANT Salem: 	Well if he's becoming a Ghoul it would be the same until he
is.. once he is he would have 
HOST ANT Salem: 	night vision
HOST ANT Numb: 	Salem, I hate to do this to you, but my brother just dropped
by for an unexpected visit. He 
HOST ANT Numb: 	brought some friends, and I can't be a rude host (pardon the
pun. <g>)  I think you're doing
HOST ANT Numb: 	great, and I'd like to send you the final questionnaire at
this point. Is there anything you
HOST ANT Numb: 	you'd like to ask me before I wrap this up?
HOST ANT Salem: 	Nope.. I'm comfortably numb 
HOST ANT Numb: 	Excellent. The test is in your mailbox... Fill it out and get
it to me by tomorrow night, 
HOST ANT Numb: 	and we'll be all set.
HOST ANT Numb: 	You're free to go. :D
HOST ANT Salem: 	Cool.. Thank ya
HOST ANT Numb: 	Thanks for coming.
HOST ANT Numb: 	Logoff time: 11:22 PM.
