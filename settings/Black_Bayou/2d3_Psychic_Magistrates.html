A Circle is a group of psychics who have banded together with a leader (the Magistrate).  Usually it is to form a group of friends with which learn and study together, but it will occasionally be to further the Magistrate's own ends.  When a psychic Circle is formed, a ritual is performed that links the members together emotionally and mentally.  The literal effects of this soul-link last a minute, but the side effects linger much longer.  <BR>
<BR>
Psychics who undergo this ritual feel an incredible link to the other Circle members.  This is represented during role-play as an almost fanatical loyalty to the Circle and it's goals.  Being away from the Circle, past the island borders, for 2 weeks or longer causes the missing Psychic discomfort that slowly grows over time.  While this discomfort isn't physically or mentally disabling, it makes the missing Psychic's life very difficult to live...it's as if someone is constantly reminding them of their proper place to be.  Once they reunite with their Circle this discomfort ends. <BR>
<BR>
To create a Circle, you must have the followers ready for the bonding ritual.  You must also have played an approved psychic character sheet for a minimum of 6 months and have Lore level 3 in Psychic.  In order to maintain your Magistrate status, you must roleplay for a minimum of 5 days during each character sheet update period.  When a Circle takes in a new member, the entire Circle must participate in the bonding ritual again.  An updated Breed Tie form must also be submitted.  The same goes for a Circle losing a member.  The bond between the Circle members is the source of the Magistrate's power.  Should the Magistrate allow his Circle to fall to two members or less, they lose their status as Magistrate and with it all their Magistrate masteries.<BR>
<BR>
When creating a new Circle of psychics there are a few topics which must be considered. While Isle Voletta is fairly large, the city itself is not. When a group of psychics bond together their auras join to become one. This one aura will connect with any others that arise.  There is only so much psychic energy allowed for each area before the mental power begins to cancel itself out.  Members of different Circles may be best friends or bitter enemies - that doesn't matter.  What matters is the number of Circles present.  For these reasons, Voletta may only support up to five psychic Circles. The clashing auras of the Circles will not allow for a sixth Circle to arise.  Once the fifth Circle has been completed the only way to create a new Circle is if one of the five has been eliminated, leaving room for another.  Each psychic Circle has an innate type of crystal associated with it.  The origins of this particular Circle identification are lost in the annals of time, but once the Circle forms they automatically know which type of crystal they have claimed.  The five possible types for Isle Voletta are Amethyst, Beryl, Colate, Rebullite and Stibnite.  The Magistrate cannot pick which one they wish to associate with their Circle, as that is the decision of fate itself.  Members from one Circle cannot identify those of other Circles, but they can identify the crystal type of personnel from their own Circle.  Members of a Circle do not have to use the chosen type of crystal as their focus object or wear it as decoration or use it in other methods, but find an underlying and almost semiconscious and compelling reason to do so.  Due to the fact that the Circles do not necessarily have to have the same bloodline, they are identified by their crystal type as the Amethyst Circle, Beryl Circle, Colate Circle, etc.<BR>
<BR>
To create a Circle a psychic must have a minimum of four followers (5 total).  A Circle may never have more than 13 members and never may fall below 3 members. (3 with the Magistrate, of course).  If the Magistrate tries to let the 14th person in, that link will just fizzle and the attempt will automatically fail.  The player of the Magistrate must submit a Breed Leader Request to </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BBSTMail</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>They will be notified if they meet the requirements for a Circle and be given their color.  The Circle members can be students, friends, or anyone else willing to follow the psychic. The only requirement is that they be an approved psychic willing to join. The psychics that are joining to form the Circle must come together and perform a ritual (the ritual changes from group to group and the exact procedures will be decided upon by the leader of the group).  This magister-to-be leads this process, linking all of the minds of the psychics involved in the ritual. <BR>
<BR>
The psychic's minds then spread out to the others in the Circle with them, using the link between themselves and the Magister to create another, weaker link to all of the others present. This creates a sort of spider web of minds, forming a psychic collective.  Whenever a new member wishes to join the Circle this entire process must be repeated, as the psychics must realign their minds to incorporate the new psychic into the mental web.<BR>
<BR>
There are only two approved ways a psychic may leave a Circle once they have joined. For the first, they must gain the consent of everyone within the Circle to break free. Once the consent of every member has been granted, the psychic's must once again do a ritual.  In this ritual the leaving member is severed from the link while the other members are reunited.  This is only possible if the basic requirements for a Circle are still being met by the group that is left.  The other way is for the psychic to form a Circle of their own. This gives the leaving psychic, the soon to be new Magister the ability to break the old link as they form a link with the new Circle. If a psychic leaves in this manner the old Circle is torn and the web falls apart, thus requiring the remaining psychics to once more join together and perform the joining ritual, as long as they still meet the requirements to form a Circle.  The Magistrate looses their Circle's power after being in this state for seven days, so haste in redoing the ritual is imperative.  This only applies for the psychic to become a Magister.  A psychic cannot leave a Circle to simply join under a new Magister. <BR>
<BR>
The only other way for the Circle to be broken is if the Magister himself breaks it. The Magister may do this at any time without requiring the consent of any of the others. This is possible because he is the center of the web and in removing himself, the web falls apart.<BR>
<BR>
When a Circle is broken, it is immediately known to the rest of the members.  The Magister will know which member it was that broke away from the Circle as that one persons link to the Magister is stronger then to that of the other psychics in the Circle, but the Magister doesn't know why or how they broke away.  That's why there may be some occurrences of a 'rogue' member of the Circle trying to escape the bonds of the link, but these situations are most often fruitless because of the mental bond of the Circle members.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>When the Brain Power Fades<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>If a Psychic dies while they still belong to the Magistrate's Circle, the rest of the Circle can feel the link within their minds suddenly fall apart, though they may not know the reasoning behind it.  The link will reform itself around the missing person almost immediately, and this is the only time that the Circle does not <U>have</U> to perform the ritual, but many Circles will as a way to heal themselves mentally from such a blow.  Nothing changes in the relationship between the dead Psychic's subjects and the Magistrate.  The unique function of the Circle is just that - everyone has equal access to the Magistrate, as the Magistrate is the center and the other Psychics are the wheel - and each Psychic has a 'spoke' leading to the Magistrate.  So, when a Psychic dies, that position on the circle closes as everyone grows closer together. <BR>

	Psychic 1<BR>
	Psychic 2<BR>
		Student 1<BR>
		Student 2<BR>
			Fledgling 1<BR>
	Psychic 3<BR>
<BR>
First of all, do not look at that list of Circle members as a line, think of it as a circle with the Magistrate in the middle.  If Student 2 were to die, their protege, "Fledgling 1" would become the student of anyone in the Circle, because that is the natural order of the circle.  If Psychic 2 were dead or were to die, then Fledgling 1 would become the student of anyone in the circle.  As you can see, it doesn't matter who leaves, the circle will care for itself in an orderly fashion.  The Magistrate often decides who will teach the more inexperienced Circle members the art of mind control, or may elect to do it themselves.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  see below <BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A true master of the mind can learn to transcend their physical form.  This normally requires great concentration and even greater mental discipline.  By opening their minds, their consciousness is released and able to move about freely, completely undetected.  The Magistrate's body will remain in the same position as when the consciousness left.  The astral projection will have no knowledge of what transpires around the body.  The spirit is capable of staying out of the body for 24 hours for each point of base Soul possessed.  The spirit must return to their physical body before this time has expired or their spirit will be lost permanently into the nether void.  This is not always as easy as it might appear.  Should their body be moved or worse - stolen, they must find where their container has been moved to...or die.  While in Astral Projection, the Magistrate may meet beings who are also in this space, or those who are Transcended - and they will be able to interact with each other as normal.  Many times, high ranking spiritual beings battle each other in the mortal world without humanity ever knowing.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>The use of this mastery allows the Magistrate to create a sensory bond with any individual within one city block.  The victim will not be aware of this bond at all.  The Magistrate will experience everything the victim experiences for the duration.  They have absolutely no control over the events, they are simply observers.  During the duration, the Magistrate may move and appear as nothing unusual was going on.  They can make simple movements, such as walking, sipping a drink, etc..  However, they would not be able to run, use a Skill or Mastery, etc.  <BR>

System/Duration: </B>2d6+Mind vs victim's 2d6+Mind / Scene; takes 2 rounds to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>Through the rituals that bring a circle together, the Magistrate gains the advantage of knowledge in regard to the others.  A Magistrate can drain the soul points from a circle member by just a look.  The loss of soul points may not be painful, but it is certainly an uncomfortable sensation.  The Magistrate will take a number of soul points equal to the number of points they scored over the victim.  If they end up taking more points than their maximum, the extra points would dissipate and be wasted.  The Magistrate cannot take more soul points than the victim has at the time.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>A Magistrate with this ability can invade a victim's mind and erase segments of their memory.  The extent of damage that can be caused depends on how many points the Magistrate scores higher than the victim.  If the victim wins the contest, the Magistrate will be affected and loose their memory from the psychic whiplash.  This memory loss is permanent.<BR>
