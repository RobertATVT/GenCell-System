	Welcome to the Black Bayou Character Sheet Department!  To prepare you for your future roles I'll try to outline some of the strategies I use when reviewing CSs, generation and updates.  This is by no way complete and all criticism is welcome.  Above all the first rule of the CS and BG departments is always play the courteous helper to the Players.  If you have to reject a CS for any reason do so in the most pleasant language you can muster and be sure to explain why the CS was rejected.<BR>
<BR>
Now, on with the show!   :-)<BR>
 <BR>
<B><U>Generation CSs:<BR>
</B></U><BR>
 	Well, start where all the players start, with Generation CSs.  When I receive a generation CS I always make sure the background is approved first.  The reason for this is if they have a problem background, say for a fantasyish character, then their CS might not fit the character after they get some advice from the BG department on changing it.  Rather then waste time checking out the points on a CS that will never be approved in that format you can return the CS to the player immediately and tell them to submit their background to BBST Mail first.<BR>
 	The other things you check for on a generation CS are rather basic, make sure they have 15 statistic points (Body Mind and Soul), and that they list how the 40 generation points for skills or masteries are listed in the XP record.  If the XP record is blank you can total up the skills, masteries and occupation costs and add the XP record for them, but that's your prerogative.  To me if the XP record is the only thing wrong on the CS I'd add it, but if there's other problems I'll tell them to add along with fixing the other problems.  And make sure the skills from an occupation are listed in the skills section of the CS.  Some players seem to think buying the occupation only gives them the opportunity to purchase the bonus skills up to there level at the reduced cost and other such strange notions.<BR>
 	Sometimes you have to remind the player they do get something for nothing with the gift, within the gifts restriction of course.  The gift cannot be used on Lore or combat skills that are included in an occupation.  The gift can be used to add three levels to a non-combat skill given by an occupation as long as it doesn't break the statistic level that limits the skill.  Also, regardless of whether or not the gift is used on an occupational skill the player cannot use generation points to add levels to that skill.<BR>
 	The gift and fighting styles are the things most frequently forgotten by both players and CS assistants for some reason, players more often then staff.  Even if they don't have a high enough level in the skill be sure players pick a fighting style for the skill, (Cadet training for Street Fighting, Karate for Trained Fighting, Etc.) Remember the limits on many fighting styles a player can have are:<BR>
<BR>
 2 Street Fighting styles<BR>
 1 Street Fighting Style and 1 Trained Fighting style<BR>
 or 1 Fighting Mastery style.<BR>
 <BR>
 ... And each style must be attached to a separate basic fighting skill.  You cannot purchase level 5 Street Fighting and then tack Cadet Training and Wrestling onto the skill as your two styles unless you purchased Level 5 street fighting twice.<BR>
	That's about all I have to say on generation CSs, their easier then my next subject.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Updates:</B></U><BR>
<BR>
 	Ok then, Updates!  The first thing you look for is to find their last approved CS, when your starting you'll probably have to get CSs from other staff members.  I'm way behind on archiving all these approved CSs from my PFC to zipped text files and haven't recovered up till the last two months yet.  But if you ever want months that I do have or eventually get finished from my archives, use them at your own risk.  However if you cannot find a copy of a players CS from a current Black Bayou staff member then you cannot approve the CS no matter how good it looks.<BR>
	The second thing to look for is how old is the CS being updated, if it's beyond two months old then the CS is inactive and must be reactivated.  Reactivation is a revision to the two month rule that was added last year.  Basically if the player's CS goes past two months in age then the player is left with two options, loose the CS and start over with a new one, or loose the unspent XP's and keep the CS in it's last approved version just with a new approval date.  The reactivation rules appear at the end of the improvement section of the Black Bayou Rulebook.<BR>
 	Anyway, the next thing to do is to make sure the player has broken down the XP total properly, Role playing, posting left over, above and beyond, etc., they need to list and give the dates for when each XP was earned.  This means all the individual RP days, dates letter awards were received along with their amounts, and other award letters/source of XPs with their dates.  If these haven't been given do not approve the CS!  So if it's not done you can immediately send it back to them and wait for the resubmission before looking at anything else, another time saving device.<BR>
 	All right, after that I look at the costs to make sure the cost is correct, then compare the submitted CS to the old approved CS to make sure the only things changed are the ones paid for, and to make sure they paid for all the appropriate levels.  There's no skipping over levels of either statistics or skills, unless the update is also a breed change in which case you have to account for the breed change, I'll go into breed changes in more detail later.<BR>
 	After checking to make sure the skills match up with the skills and statistics on the last approved CS, and checking the XP record to make sure the costs are right and they have enough XP to pay for it all, you'd check the modifiers as you would on a generation CS.  And then change the "Date of last approved CS" line up at the top of the CS to the current date and it's basically ready to go.  Leave the "date of update" line in the XP record the date of submittal, the XP record dates will be used if the number of XPs a player has earned is question.<BR>
 	Speaking of the XP records, give them a look, CSs that look like they have questionable XPs on them can be checked up on.  BBSTIsil is currently the one checking room Logs for us.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Breed Changes:<BR>
<BR>
</B></U>	All right, for breed changes, players get the breeds breed bonus added to their stats, and level one lore in their new breed if they had no lore in it before.  Character's created as a breed other then mortal however do not get free level one lore, but we might not have to worry about that for a long time if ever.<BR>
 	If the new breed has a mastery that the old breed also had, the only obvious example that I can think of is extended mindspeak, and the character had that mastery in their old breed, then they'd get the equivalent mastery as the new breed.  For instance if a Psychic has extended mindspeak, and then was vamped, they'd get the Vampire extended mindspeak in the breed change.  There are other possibilities in there but I don't know of anyone whose tried to find them all.<BR>
 	Fighting masteries work differently, if you have the breed fighting style in your old breed you get half the breed fighting style of the new breed rounded up.  So if that same Psychic had the Psychic breed fighting mastery at level 5, then he'd get the Vampire breed fighting style at level 3.<BR>
 	A character can go through two breed changes in their career, but if they get that second breed change (say that Psychic was created Mortal) then the first breed bonus they got would be removed before the second breed bonus was added.  So the Psychic would loose the Psychic breed bonus before adding the Vampire breed bonus to they're statistics, this does not apply to the free lore bonus.<BR>
 	Any breed change CS that comes your way needs to having the SN of the character creating (training, siring or whatever) the character into the breed listed on the CS.  And a couple of them may need a link or two, I'll go through what each breed needs for a breed change approval separately.<BR>
 <BR>
 Psychics - SN of the one training the new Psychic in the Psychic Arts and a link of one post of the training.<BR>
 Lamia - SN of the one training the new Lamia in the Lamia Arts and a link of one post of the training.<BR>
 Vampire - SN of the one Siring the new Vampire and a link to the post of the ST'd blood rush roll (Must be a registered ST who witnessed the roll, not another player subbing in for the roll).<BR>
 Werewolf - SN of the one who bit the one becoming a Werewolf, a link to the required ritual that must be posted before the biting, and the required roll by the biting Wolf to resist tearing their target apart.<BR>
 Angels & Demon - Copy of the approval letter for the breed change and one post involved in the possession of the mortal body to serve the light or the darkness.  The current Angel/Demon advisor is BBST Lycaon and since he handles all issues regarding these CSs you'll probably not often put this knowledge into use.<BR>
 <BR>
 	And last thing I can think of for the breed change subject is that Angels and Demons have to become Mortal before they can become their opposite.  Call it proving their worth to the light or the darkness after they've worked for the enemy.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Approvals and Rejections:</B></U><BR>
 <BR>
 	Lets move on to CS approvals and rejections now.  The subject lines off approved CSs must contain the players SN, what type of approval it is, the date and the breed.  Some abbrievations that appear in approved CSs subject lines include:<BR>
<BR>
CS: Generation CS<BR>
UD: Updated CS<BR>
BC: Breed Change CS<BR>
SN: SN Change CS<BR>
NU: Non-UD<BR>
RV: Reactivated CS<BR>
<BR>
	Breed changes and SN changes are rather obvious in what they are.  Non-UDs are CSs that are sent in with no changes made, the player just wants to keep the CS active so they won't suffer from the two month rule.  Also sometimes CSs are regenerated, where the player has created a new generation CS for their character for whatever reason, they wanted a new one that fit their character better then their old one, or they lost it to the two month rule, there is no standard abbreviation for a regeneration.<BR>
 	Try always to be polite, no calling the players names as tempting as it may be, and I usually separate what needs to be changed by paragraphs or lists so they can tackle 'em one at a time.  There's no standard format on rejection letters, some people like to put "rejected" in the subject line, or change the subject line to look like an approval but changing that all important word "Approved" to rejected and some just leave it as a standard reply subject line.  Just try to make the letter sound as clear and polite as you can.  I'm the only one allowed to be insulting to people. :-)  Well not really, but if your writing letters to players who've been caught cheating or doing other bad things it's hard to make them sound all cheerful and sugary if you have to punish them.<BR>
 	Approvals go to the entire department, I'll be sending everyone an adapted list for approvals to be sent to when we put you on the roster.  Rejections only go to the player and BBST Mail.<BR>
 	And you get to make your own approval stamp as to how it looks, the colors basically.  As long as it gets the message through to the player that the CS is approved, and any notes of changes you might have made to the CS from what they submitted, like modifiers you may have corrected.<BR>

<B><I>This is an old policy that seems virtually forgotten now adays... unfortunately due in part by my lack to remind people of it (even forgot to put it on the newest version of his Email trainer).  And the rule is...<BR>
<BR>
The Character Sheet Department Manager is the only one who can approve reactivations that are over 6 months old!  I.E. I have to do it.  It was originally part of a bargain with Paws at the creation of the reactivation rules to avoid setting a permanent time limit on how old a CS can be before it is no longer available for reactivation.  Hell, the reactivation rules were written to get Paws away from the idea of just deleting all CSs that went over the two month mark in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
And now that you've got your BB history lesson, remember if you see a CS that's over 6 months old to pass it my way.  Thank you.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Hello everybody!  I just thought I'd write up a little review letter for you all for CS procedure questions that might arise with the new rulebook that goes into effect tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
</I>Occupations-</B><BR>
	Just because the skills packaged with an occupation have changed does <B><U>not</B></U> mean every character that bought the occupation previously gets the new skill/level.  They will get the opportunity to buy the skills at a lower cost, they will get the new occupational advantage, the skills they have though will not change.  Essentially it's the same as if someone changes occupations or buys a new occupation after generation.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Generating as a breed-</B><BR>
	No one's had to deal with this one for a while, so heres a few things to remember if you get someone generating as a breed.  First of all they do <B><U>not</B></U> get a breed change bonus, you only get a bonus when changing breeds not generating.  This applies not only to statistic modifiers but the free level of lore people get when changing breeds.  Characters that generate as a breed do not receive level one lore in their breed for free, they must pay for all levels.<BR>
	For backgrounds, well it should be obvious, but they should mention how they became their breed.  Did someone train them to be a Psychic or Lamia when they were a kid?  Was it their parents?  Was one of their parents a Werewolf and they suddenly flew into Horus at age 18? (Reportedly, they cannot go Horus before then)<BR>
	And also remember characters that are generated as a breed have no gift!  A gift only comes with Mortality as it is a Mortals special ability.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Reduced "new" cost-</B><BR>
	In past rulebook updates new skills and masteries that were added were offered to existing characters at a reduced cost, as far as I know for this update we are not offering that this time.  If someone has some info that says I'm wrong please bring it forward. :-) But I'm bringing this up now since even if we don't offer it there are some unscrupulous players that have tried to railroad getting something at a "new" cost when we didn't offer it as such before, be aware.<BR>
<BR>
Eh, that's all I can think of for now, keep those CSes rolling!<BR>
