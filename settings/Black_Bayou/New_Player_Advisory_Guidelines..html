	The New Player Advisory Department is a good will and knowledge bank set up to assist new players in their entrance to Black Bayou.  Through one on one training, and hands on assistance this department will gather potentially interested players and bolster that interest into the desire needed to play and become contributing members of Black Bayou.  Each member of this department would recieve training on how to interact with players and proper do's and don'ts when teaching them about the game.  (For example, not training to create a certain style of CS so you can nab them IC later.)  The main mission of this department is to offer a hand in explaining certain aspects of the rules and how to begin playing, this includes how to make a BG, When you can submit your CS and making the new players feel welcomed and wanted.  Welcoming is the highest priority, as a lot of new players feel that they are unwanted in the game.  Here are a few of the ideas that I have for the duties and requirements for this department.<BR>

<BR>
	1) Must be willing to put forth at least four hours per week to train New players in a class type setting, either in a PR or in Black Bayou I.  These "classes" will be two hour sessions in which the advisor will teach or train their field to the players.  The object here is to inform them on how the game works, and to teach them what they need to know, including room etiquette and what have you.  All Advisors may elect to spend any other time they feel is needed assisting players and if possible can find older players who are willing to talk to these new players or help out.  The following is a list of positions within the new dept. and what individual requirements and duties are needed.<BR>
  <BR>
<B><I>	<U>New Player Advisor</B></I></U><BR>
	This person is the Manager of the department and responsible for scheduling and assuring the training of the members of the department.  It is their job to provide both an environment for the new players to feel welcome and to assure that the members of this department are fulfilling the duties required.  It is the New Player Advisors job to answer questions on OOC manipulation, and other areas not covered by the rest of his staff.  The New Player Advisor is required to be an approved ST and Have training in at least one other department (CS or BG).<BR>
<BR>
	<B><I><U>Background Advisors</B></I></U><BR>
	The background is the foundation of a new players character and entrance into Black Bayou.  This advisor will help the new players create ideas and train them on how to make a proper and approvable background, by answering question and offering suggestions to the players when needed. (Must be qualified from the BG Dept)<BR>
<BR>
	<B><I><U>CS Advisor</B></I></U><BR>
	The CS is the statistical makeup of the character in Black Bayou, and often the most troubling area for a new player to grasp.  The CS Advisor will show the new players how to make characters, how to properly track Experience and the proper way to update their characters.  (Must be Qualified from the CS Dept)<BR>
<BR>
	<B><I><U>Storyline Advisor</B></I></U><BR>
	As the other advisors, the Storyline Advisor will inform and train the new players on what makes a storyline and what can and can't be done with a SL.  (Must be qualified by the SL Dept)<BR>
<BR>
	<B><I><U>Combat Advisor</B></I></U><BR>
	Although Combat isn't an essential part of Black Bayou, it happens and most often to new players who simply may not know better.  This position must be held by a trained ST so that they can teach the new players on how the combat system in BB works.  This training will assist in alleviating a lot of troubles and questions and hopefully will speed the process of combat up when dealing with newer players.<BR>
<BR>
	<B><I><U>Skill & Occupation Advisor</B></I></U><BR>
	The Skill & Occupation Advisor is responsible on teaching new players how skills are used and what can and can't be done with them.<BR>
<BR>
	<B><I><U>Mastery & Breed Advisor</B></I></U><BR>
	The explanation of Breeds and Masteries is an important one, often new players have a skewed view on what the breeds are and how it all works, the job of this advisor is to provide that insight into what they are all about.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I><U>Classes and Scheduling</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I></U><BR>
	The classes will be twice a day from 8-10 and from 10-12 in the other BB room or a PR.  This will meet Peek hours and host with a new player can direct them to us at these times.  There are seven classes to be held and they will take place twice a week.  These classes are BG, CS, SL, Combat, Skill & Occ, Breed & Mastery, and General Q&A.  Advisors will most likely be teaching two divisions except for the Manager who handle the general Q&A.<BR>
	<BR>
	Hopefully through use of the advisors in this department New staff members, moving towards a one of the departments covered by the advisors, can also receive the training and basis for the department that they are hoping to enter.  </HTML>
