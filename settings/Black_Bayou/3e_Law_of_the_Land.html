Isle Voletta is a place where the crime rate greatly exceeds the norm for a city of its size.  That's not even close when you consider the supernatural element and their crimes that often go unreported.  The introduction of the supernatural within the local Sheriff's department brought a silent awareness of the problem at hand.  This led to a certain amount of.. intensity among members of the department.<BR>
<BR>
This is a game steeped with horror.  The police are undermanned and as a result, they overcompensate with firepower and force.  While all of the police are not cold hearted machines, you're best bet is to stay out of trouble.  Or rather, keep your trouble to the shadows.<BR>

We can't remind you enough.  Black Bayou is a role-playing game.  The police in this game, especially the player characters, are going to act as they would if they existed in real life.  That means if you role-play resisting arrest, taunting them or mess with them in any way, you can expect a reasonable response.  The player-officers in the game are well versed in the rules and the concepts involved with the part.<BR>
<BR>
Whenever an arrest is made, the officer must fill out an arrest report (click this link to</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#383430" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>request a copy of the forms: <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Arrest Report Form request">Request for Arrest Report</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>).  They are also required to make a post in the <A HREF="aol://5863:126/mB:128018">Voletta Court Reporter</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> folder in our</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#383430" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Black Bayou Message Boards</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#383430" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The case will then be forwarded to the Judge</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#383430" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.<BR>

If there are no officer player characters online when a crime is reported, a host, Storyteller or Gamemaster will play the role of the officers as non-player characters. We have an official Officer NPC sheet that is used when these situations arise.  However, if a known officer-player is online and role-playing, they will be called <B><I>first</B></I> to handle the situation.  If an officer is online and in need of "Backup", hosts, Storytellers or Gamemasters can be called to role-play non-player character police.  Only BBSTs on staff, Storytellers or Gamemasters may utilize non-player character police.<BR>

There are a few things to consider once you've been arrested.  First is your timeline.  You have two weeks from the day of your arrest to find a lawyer to represent you.  If you cannot find or will not use an In Character lawyer after two weeks, a court appointed Public Defender NPC ran by a Black Bayou ST will handle the case.  You can also choose to use this Public Defender right from the beginning, you don't have to wait for the two weeks to expire first.  <BR>
<BR>
The second thing you need to consider is your plea.<BR>
<BR>
1) Pleading no Contest- This means that you are not saying you are guilty or innocent, but that you will let the judge do as he sees fit, which will probably resort in less time afforded in jail.  However, your character may only do this -once- throughout his entire career in Black Bayou. <BR>
<BR>
2) Pleading Guilty- This means your character is saying that he indeed did do the crime and should be punished accordingly, meaning you will not receive a trial or law rolls.  You will get the maximum sentence for all of your crimes.<BR>
<BR>
3) Pleading Innocent- Here is where things get tricky.  You are saying that you are not guilty of the crimes your character committed  At this point, the Constitution affords you the right to an attorney.  If you choose this decision, you will have one of two options.  Find a player character attorney to represent you, or send a letter to BBST Mail asking for the use an NPC Public Defender that any ST can use for you.<BR>
<B><BR>
</B>The Judge is a volunteer who is chosen by Black Bayou management to handle the arrest cases.  The Judge will review the logs and the case reports and arrive at a decision based on the following guidelines:<BR>

The laws in Black Bayou will be enforced to the best of the Sheriff Department's ability.  When playing, please keep in mind the following:  <BR>
<BR>
If you are a member of the supernatural community, remember you are trying to keep your true nature a secret.  Getting arrested isn't the worst thing in the world and fighting is not usually the best answer.  There are ways of having your sentence reduced or dropped entirely.  From role-play to character skills, the means exist for you to discover.  Of course, the best way not to get arrested is to either stay out of trouble, or keep your evil dealings to the shadows. <BR>
<BR>
If you are Mortal, and an officer approaches you for arrest, you should role-play it as if it were happening in real life.  You cannot suddenly develop superpowers nor vanish into thin air.  If you attempt to run from the police, you must follow the normal rules for escape (See the <A HREF="aol://4344:1192.combat.9390616.578715410">Combat In The Bayou</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> section for more details). <BR>
<BR>
Role-players will not be able to just <B><I>ignore</B></I> police officers going about their duty.  Basically if you do, the Storyteller or Gamemaster will render a decision in your case, and probably put your character in jail.  What does this mean?  You will not be allowed to role-play that character in Black Bayou until either freed on Bail, found innocent or through the other avenues recognized by the law. The above decisions will be made by the Forum Director.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Note:</B>  If you ignore an Officer in the process of his duties in Black Bayou, it is treated as a case of OOC Manipulation and you will be subject to the penalties as posted in the section:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#383430" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <A HREF="aol://4344:1192.bbrules.9386003.566147383">Black Bayou Playing Rules</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#383430" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>If you PUNT and cannot return immediately, upon return, E-Mail the officer players and the Storyteller / Gamemaster to finish the scene. You will have 48 hours to setup a time.
