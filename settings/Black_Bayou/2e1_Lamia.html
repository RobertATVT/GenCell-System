Spell weavers, whether by incantation, ritual, or sheer force of will.  These mortals wield magnificent powers, being able to shape consciousness at will.  Though every mortal has the capacity for spell weaving of one form or another, a dedication of study and the right mentor is required (please see What you are and what you might become.. for details).<BR>
<BR>
You know them, yet you do not know them.  They are around you always but, unless you have the Lore, what they are truly eludes you.  They can be your mother, your sister, your brother.  You can love them.  You can hate them.  They may be more beautiful than you could ever dream.  They may be uglier than that creature from your worst nightmare.  Yet, they are real.  Very real.  They are mortal.  They eat, drink, sleep and breathe.  Tickle them and they will laugh.  Cut them and they will bleed.  Hurt them and they will cry.  If you love them, they may return that love.  Scorn them and their fury will be as tempestuous as that of any other mortal.  Life is precious.  Death comes to them as easily as it does any one of us.<BR>
<BR>
Yet, Lamia possess the power of magic. They can focus their will and emotion to effect change in both the world around you and the world within you.  Lamia may be good, evil or neither.  Their magic is positive or negative depending on the path they choose. They have the ability to cast spells.  They can condense the very air around you, trapping you in an invisible vice, with the most beguiling smile they can reach out and touch you, causing the most excruciating pain.  At any given moment, they can hold out their hands and you will witness lightening raining down from the stormy skies above, you may feel yourself slow in your tracks or they may disappear from sight entirely.  The vast power these individuals hold are virtually limitless.<BR>
<BR>
To perform these spells, the Lamia combine their mental and emotional energies.  The need must be present to bring any spell to a successful culmination.  To work, they must be clear, concise, focused and emotional.  The Lamia has the choice of how they cast their spells, and should indicate as such while role-playing.  To simply type in ##Lightning## is not sufficient.  The Lamia need to focus, thinking of what they are about to do.  For example, when Arrolin causes lightning to fall from the skies, he imagines the desired effect in his mind, focusing his energy, throwing his arms out and orally commanding the elements around him.  If the spell fails a Lamia must role-play why.  Perhaps the Lamia's concentration was broken, or the Lamia had a cold.  Some unfortunate person may have simply tapped them on the shoulder.  Failure in a die throw is mechanical.. failure to a Lamia can be explained.  Renee has failed casting various spells, some she was not very adept in and still needed to learn.. at other times she was distracted, her concentration broken thus causing the spell to falter.<BR>
<BR>
Rituals, for whatever reason and learning new spells (as a Lamia updates his/her sheet) must be posted.  Be creative.  Use talismans, amulets, powders, candles, chants and magic words.  We may share the same magic, but we need not cast our spells the same way.  As in life, you can be taught something, but how you apply it to your everyday life is your choice.  Mortals are individuals, each one different.  Such are Lamia.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  A member of this breed will die when they have been brought to the negative equivalent of their Body stat (i.e. a body of 5 must be brought down to -5).  However, there are a couple of ways to seriously injure a Lamia.  Salt water can cause serious damage to a Lamia when it is properly prepared (please see Lamia Lore Level 3 below).  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the Lamia is exposed to it.  Fire wounds can be deadly, but can also cause serious damage since they take twice as long to heal normally.  See Healing below for more details.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> A Lamia will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e. a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  Wounds created by either fire or salt water take twice as long to heal than normal.<BR>

Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You may believe that Lamia are evil, lapdogs of the dark.  You may believe they are evil, shrewd old ladies who ride brooms off into the night.  Perhaps you understand the difference between white and black magic.  Thoughts of zombies and voodoo dolls come to mind as well as potions and cauldrons.  Lamia are known to be able to shift into the forms or Ravens and Black Cats.  According to legend, Lamia can't abide the touch of salt.  They work their magic secretly and sometimes almost too obviously.  Lamia tend to stick together in Covens, if they aren't off by themselves.  One thing is for sure.  With the right combination of words and ingredients, there is nothing a Lamia can't do.<BR>

Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false.  You've learned that even Lamia have limits.  You have a better understanding of the different types of magic, from black to white, from wicca to the cabal, your knowledge is slowly growing.  When a Lamia uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the Lamia use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Circle of Salt:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Legend has it that Lamia cannot abide the presence of salt.  For those who truly believe, this simple protection ritual serves as more than a simple deterrent to keep Lamia at bay.  The character must pour a thick line of salt completely around them.  A few grains simply will not do.  The circle can be no larger than ten feet in diameter.  The circle must be complete, unbroken.  Once it has been completed, the character must allow their own belief empower the circle.  To do this, the player must roll 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  If this is successful, no Lamia will be able to cross the circle, regardless of their form.  Due to its repellent nature, the salt of the circle prevents the Lamia from disturbing it in any way.  They will not be able to cast spells into the circle either.  Any spells affecting someone who enters a circle of salt will be immediately dispelled.  This may also be used to trap a Lamia, encircling them in a circle of salt.  In this case, the character must roll 2d6+Soul+Faith vs the Lamia's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the Lamia is successfully trapped, they will not be able to move or cast spells outside of the circle.  This includes mindspeak.  Should the circle be broken with even the smallest gap, the empowerment of faith escapes, rendering the circle useless.  Also, the duration of the circle is 24 hours (regardless of how it is used).  No Lamia may approach closer than 10 feet nor affect in anyway a circle of salt.<BR>

You know about ritual upon ritual, even if you may not be able to use them yourself.  You truly understand the reasoning behind each practice of magic that is out there.  More importantly, you understand the real power behind magic, the mind.  Magic is the art of changing consciousness at will.  Meaning, through the power of belief, the Lamia can bring about change in the conscious world around you.  Having studied Lamia for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a Lamia uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Lamia by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Lamia, which happens to be Thaumaturge.  If you wish to identify the Lamia as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Lamia, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Lamia transform either to or from Thaumaturge.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Lamia.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8080ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Salt Water: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Salt water is little more than water mixed with salt and empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough salt water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the Lamia with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of salt water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the Lamia are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the Lamia suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The Lamia must heal the damage as any normal mortal would, except at twice the normal rate.  That would mean each point of damage would take 6 days to heal rather than 3.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Lamia heal faster at the maximum rate of normal healing speed.  Salt water wounds cause disfiguring scars that will eventually heal after a months time.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.
