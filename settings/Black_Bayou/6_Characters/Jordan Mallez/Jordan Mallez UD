System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Name:</B> Jordan Mallez  <BR>
<B>Breed:</B> Mortal<BR>
<B>Age: </B>June 5th, 1975<BR>
<B>Eyes: </B>Hazel/Amber<BR>
<B>Hair:</B> Black<BR>
<B>Height:</B> 6'5<BR>
<B>Weight:</B> 195lbs<BR>
<B>Occupation:</B> Scholar<BR>
<B>Equipment:</B> Pen, Zippo Lighter, MAC card, Driver's License, Palmtop Organizer, Cellphone, pack of Contraceptives, Laptop, Encyclopedia of the Occult (CD-ROM), BMW Motorcycle w/saddlebags, several shirts, HiTek Magnum Swat Trainer Boots, 2 pairs Leather Pants, electric razor, hairbrush, toothbrush, deodorant/antipersperant<BR>
<B>Appearance:</B> Alex is the image of wiry, lithe musculature.  With unkempt hair, penchant for black clothing and pale skin from a youth spent indoors.<BR>
 <BR>
<B>Background:</B> I had spent most of my life studying the occult.  It started innocently enough I suppose, late-night horror movies on TV and the occasional odd book I found in the public library.  Of course, the more I read the more sense it made.   Maybe 'sense' isn't the right word.  I began to understand certain underlying metaphysics, began to notice pattern in the sea of conflicting folklore.  <BR>
	By the time I was 16 I had few friends.   My family generally tended to ignore me, which I thought was for the best anyway.  My mother had been having a long-standing affair with a married man since before I was born, one of my family's dirty little secrets I had overheard when they thought I was lost in my books.  That's why my Father had left when I was still a boy.<BR>
	I was also forced into proficiency in martial arts.  As I continued to grow in skill and size, eventually the schoolyard brawls ended, despite my "odd" nature.    Barcelona's reputation as the world's friendliest city isn't always deserved.<BR>
	Still, I wasn't one to complain.  I had my studies, and my mother's lover, Alexander Martel was very generous to us.  Even after I graduated, I was able to devote myself to my studies full time...  Until Alexander's death.<BR>
	Three days after his death, the grave was found decicrated.  My mother was horrified, but it was like a strange clarity came over me as I looked at the remains of the sepulchure.  I suspected...  Then my mother died, her throat ripped out not a week after Alexander's death.  That clarity still hung in the air like the copper taint of her blood, and at that moment I knew.<BR>
	Alexander had broken free from the shackles of death, had taken my mother's life...  and if those of us he knew were to be his victims, then I was in danger.  I believe he had a son, somewhere in the southeastern United States, named Victor.<BR>
	Wheter he believes me or not is irrelivant.  I can't stay here, and if I can't tell him, I can at least try and do something should the beast appear.  Clarity.<BR>
