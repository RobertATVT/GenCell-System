	My mind raced with the anticipation of what was to come, and if this would be my final confrontation with this age old foe.  His minions swarmed around him like pestilance on the innocent face of a child, and he seemed dirty.  Never before have I ever seen this being so drawn and terrible, never so lacking the luster of the beauty he contained.  Something was dreadfully wrong, of that I was sure.  His movements were slow and ungainly and his eyes drooped in a terrible stupor.  Has he finally weakened?<BR>

My task is simple, to carry portents and omens to those that will receive them and open the eyes of mankind.  From one great man to another I go, touching them with knowledge from on high.  Not all are the faithful middle world men and women of the bible, I appear in many guises to suit the needs of God's people.  To some simpler people I appear as various animals, here to guide them and teach them the ways.  To some I am a shining light in the daytime.  Each of them see me as they understand, and I leave them with a sliver of knowledge that they would have spent years finding.  I am Gabriel, Messenger of God.<BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The large statuesque figure lurched forward again, seemingly carried by the lesser minions that walled it in on both sides.  This all felt so very wrong, so very out of place.  Was it that I am no longer an Angel?  Could I fend them off with the light like I did in days long past?  I suppose I would find out soon enough.  I have already learned that while I hold this light a controlling peace washes over me and holds my mind in constant control.  I feel like more of a warrior than I ever have before, that was always Michaels job, he was the guardian when the Rising came... but where is he now?  Suddenly I felt a surge forward and lost my stomach to the rising sickness, and my eyes lifted amidst the gut wrenching heaves that shook my body.  That was the reason for the lurching movements, and the sagging eyes...  I wasn't looking at the Father of Lies at all...<BR>
	"Oh dear Father, save us all...."<BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Memories pass freely now, at least more than they have in the past 22 years.  I recall now who I am and what I once was.  How I came to be like this may forever remain a mystery, but for now I regret nothing.  I have Petra here, I have her love and the love of my Father.  If the rest of Heavens Host only knew the joy that anothers undying love can bring to you.  I also remember my brothers in heaven.  Michael, Raphael, Uriel, Sammael, all of us are the Arch Angels, the Principle Powers of the Choirs of Heaven.  We all have our duties to perform, some more tasking than others but none are unimportant in the scheme of things...  but Michael was the Warrior.  Michael would be the greatest and strongest of us all.  He was the guardian of Earth and stood with the light to keep the Darkness from spilling fully over into Earth and tearing it to shreds.  Michael was the last bastion of hope for the World.<BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"What have they done to you Michael?"  The sight before me was horrific at best.  Some foul despicable creatures must have finally overcome my brother and rent him asunder.  The beautiful alabaster figure that made it's way towards me was nothing more than the flesh of my brother stretched over puppet of sorts, and moved by the shambling horde of devils and imps that crawled over it like insects to a dying man.  The sight still sent gouts of bile from my lips, how could he have fallen?  How can I do anything to hold them back?  I am no match for Michael, I never have been a warrior like he was.  And there is his face, that beautiful visage crafted carefully by the Father himself... stretched across a mimic... made into a mask of taunting putresence.  And I grew angry, and I felt the rage, and I stayed controlled....  and now is the time to kill.<BR>
