Desolate Voletta<BR>
11:52pm</B><BR>
<BR>
	All was lovely in those short moments, I was floating along a tunnel of light towards Petra and Solange.  I had already decided that an eternity of happiness was worth the pain I had suffered and the tragedies in life.  Suddenly the light began to fade and with it the image of her slipped through his fingers.  The lights warmth fell from his body and his eyes fluttered open to look upon the face of a man.  <BR>
<BR>
	"Well, glad to see you finally woke up.  I've been waiting for you."  His voice was calm and low, thick with a mingled european accent.  The voice rolled from perfectly shaped lips that were the slightest pale, and made brighter by the pale marble like flesh that surrounded it.  This face was perfect and bereft of any sign of age, like a moving statue.  Beautiful and fierce eyes gazed kindly upon me, cold as ice and as seering as I had though mine to be once.  How I paled in comparison to this angelic man squatting beside me.<BR>
<BR>
	"I thought I was dead...  " I tried to sit up, but my bady failed me.  Pain flooded me in dark waves, but I could hardly feel it past the numb of dead weight.<BR>
<BR>
	"Technically...  people love to bring up technicalities, so trivial and uneeded.  Technically a Werewolf shouldn't exist, nor a Vampire.  But here you are my friend.  Not that there's much hope for you as a werewolf any longer.  I'm here to offer you a solution."  The figure stood, tall and lean as his body unfolded from the floor, every visible inch of his skin was perfectly unmarred, perfectly kept and ageless.  What was this man?  Perhaps an Angel sent to me in my darkest hour?<BR>
<BR>
	"Something like that"  He grinned and winked to me as he spun around collecting the words he would use to communicate his purpose, leaving me to bewilder over the fact that he was reading my mind.<BR>
<BR>
	"In your last moments before the demon child put a silver bullet through that perfectly white crowned skull of yours, what was it you were trying to do?"  His head turned to look at me, yet his lips never once moved.  Cold eyes seemed to bury deep within me, seeking the answers.  I didn't have to speak, he knew I was trying to reach my beloved Petra.  To give her one last kiss goodbye.<BR>
<BR>
	"Granted you had a prayer upon your lips, but your ever last bit of defiance brought you to her, the woman you love more than life.  Am I correct in that?" Yes, yes he was correct... the prayer was more intinctual habit, all I wanted was to die by her side... what difference did it make?  Why can't I move?<BR>
<BR>
	"Because you aren't completely alive Gabriel, you are bound here by my will, you see... Petra is not dead.  I can't tell you the exact details but I can assure you that she is still in this world.  Still longing for your embrace.  Do you want to join her?  She will be here an eternity, as can you.  God has his own plans for you, but in doing them you will have to kill your one love.  This is what I offer you.  Stay here, take my gift to you, and protect her as you have always wanted.  Protect her with the ability that God would not allow you.  Save her Gabriel."  A flick of his wrist brought me standing to my feet, it was then that I noticed a tattoo across his neck of small raven wings.  I still couldn't move.<BR>
<BR>
	"Are you a Dark One?"  My voice was trembling, and afraid.  Petra still alive?  How could it be, I saw her die, I died to be wit her.  "How could you let this happen to me?" I cried loud into the night, caring not who heard my plea to God.<BR>
<BR>
	"He works in mysterious ways Gabriel, but you should know that now." His voice a taunt.  "Do you wish to stay here, with her, or would you prefer to move on and let those hypocritic "saviors" have their way with her?  They will kill her, mark my words.  All through her life these men of good hurt her one after another, her mentor, her father, friends and such that were to be good to her, protect her and lift her up in mind and spirit.  What did they do though Gabriel?  Did they help her?  Did Nitram love her when he tried to rape her?  Was Angus not just trying to court her in his so devilishly innocent prgmatic way?  Was Victor not simply trying to impose his own stregth over the two of you and drive you from her?"<BR>
<BR>
	Too much... I had not the strength to endure this, he was correct.  Angus was a good man though, in all of this he was the only man worthy to touch her, and comfort her.  He never meant her harm, but the rest were animals.  Now clothed in the wraps of good men, out to save the people of Voletta from the Dark Ones.  Which world would be better?  Neither, they all need to go.  Petra is my love, I will stay with her till the end of time, and let no man put usunder what was built by the hands of Gabriel Prophet.  God left me to die here, all for nothing, another ploy to strip her from my hands...  Nothing could be trusted, nothing could be loved, only her... She will be the flames that fuels the engine of my Dark Vengeance.  <BR>
<BR>
	And then he laughed, my fate was sealed and I could feel the awakening of my body, and he let me drop to the floor.  A dark surge ripped through me, voices taunting me in a chorus of betrayal and hatred, my soul burned inside me with a cry for vengeance... They would all perish.  Nothing shall live through this save Petra and myself.  I felt, glorified with power, I felt wrath, I felt greed, I felt Envy, I felt Gluttony, I wanted Lust, I stood up defiantly shaking my fist to the Heavens with Pride...  No power would stop me, no Lord or Master.  I am forever here.<BR>
<BR>
	The stranger looked at me, in all the cloud of overtaking I missed his change.  His back grew into two enormous feathered fings, black as the darkest night, his eyes slid into the shapes of lifted almonds slitted like a cats and his face gaunt and perfectly in it's terrible change.<BR>
<BR>
	"Welcome to the Cull Gabriel, long have we awaited for the fall of our most righteous brother.  Our Father has lost a most loved vessel this night."  With a sneer he took flight, vanishing into the night.  I stood and watched him, a life long shrouded in this mortal coil.  Ancient times when we were sent as messengers to mankind, we were Avengers, Shepards, Guardians, Healers, and Harbingers for the father.  I remember bringing the message to Mary, that of a child born of immaculate conception...  That she would give birth to the savior of mankind.  Long did I follow the words of my Father, long did I Avenge and Protect mankind...  But now he deserted me, tried to take me from something I loved, perhaps more than him.  <BR>
<BR>
	I stretched forth my arms and my once pristine wings grew forth from my shoulders raven black and powerful as they had always been.  I felt the surge of darkness flowing through me more power than I could ever pull before.  In my rage I shall be the great destroyer, once the Archangel Gabriel brought down entire armies, now I shall do so again.  All for the love of a woman.</HTML>
