Does and angel contemplate my fate<BR>
And do they know<BR>
The places where we go<BR>
When we're grey and old<BR>
'cos I've been told<BR>
That salvation lets their wings unfold<BR>
So when I'm lying in my bed<BR>
Thoughts running through my head<BR>
And I feel that love is dead<BR>
I'm loving angels instead<BR>
<BR>
And through it all she offers me protection<BR>
A lot of love and afftection <BR>
Wether I'm right or wrong<BR>
And down the waterfall<BR>
Wherever it may take me<BR>
I know that life won't break me<BR>
When I come to call she won't forsake me<BR>
I'm loving angels instead<BR>
<BR>
When I'm feeling weak<BR>
And my pain walks down a one way street<BR>
I look above<BR>
And I know I'll always be blessed with love<BR>
And as the feeling grows<BR>
She breathes flesh to my bones<BR>
And when love is dead<BR>
I'm loving angels indtead<BR>
<BR>
And through it all she offers me protection<BR>
A lot of love and affection<BR>
Wether I'm right or wrong<BR>
And downt he water fall<BR>
Wherever it may take me<BR>
I know that life won't break me<BR>
When I come to call she won't forsake me<BR>
I'm loving angels instead<BR>
