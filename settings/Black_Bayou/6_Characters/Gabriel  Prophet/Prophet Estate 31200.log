Gabriel Prophet: 	(( you want to start love?))
Petra Kendall: 	<kisses gently>
Petra Kendall: 	(Sure)
Petra Kendall: 	::The water trickles down within the shower, four jets aimed
at the tiny form within from 
Petra Kendall: 	four different directions.  She stands with her back to the
stall door--large though the 
Petra Kendall: 	'stall' may be--and plants her tiny hands against the wall as
the water hits her, the heat 
Petra Kendall: 	penetrating layer upon layer of old scar tissue.  Her wet
hair falls in a cable to her 
Petra Kendall: 	knees, like a wet rope of pale fire, and her eyes are closed
as she simply stands under the 
Petra Kendall: 	water with a wordless moan::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Comes into the Bathroom he hears the water running and
wants nothing more than to join her
Gabriel Prophet: 	the dreams taking their toll on intimacy and time has been
rough and distant lately:: Care ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	if I join you love?
Petra Kendall: 	::her head lifts from where it had drooped under the weight
of stress and water, and she 
Petra Kendall: 	half-turns to look over her shoulder, steam rising in a
thick, pale mist, water beading on 
Petra Kendall: 	her slender frame:: (s) Please...please do, my love.
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Drops the robe from his shoulders and steps into the
shower with her, leaning to press a ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	kiss against her lips and his hands wrap around her slight,
wet body.  small kisses are ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	rained on her face and his hands stop to rest on her
backside, patting it in little ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	splishing sounds::  I'm sorry I haven't been here much
Angel...
Petra Kendall: 	(s) It's...all right, my love...I know you've had little
time, of late...and the dreams...  
Petra Kendall: 	::she tilts her head to look up at him over her shoulder,
biting her lower lip::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Turns her around to face him, and kisses her forehead
lightly, arms wrapped around~
Gabriel Prophet: 	her waist and his lips brushing and nudging at her::  I
shouln't leave you so alone...  I'm~
Gabriel Prophet: 	so sorry love... I love you so much... I just want you to
not feel caged or restricted.
Petra Kendall: 	::her head obeys gravity's pull and her face tilts toward the
floor even as she curls more 
Petra Kendall: 	deeply into his arms to avoid looking at him, knowing he
tries so hard and it's not his 
Petra Kendall: 	fault when things go wrong.  She has no right to feel
skittish or alone:: (s) It's all 
Petra Kendall: 	right, love...
Gabriel Prophet: 	Look at me baby, I want to see it in your eyes...
Petra Kendall: 	::she looks up at him slowly, almost reluctantly, just
wanting so very badly to enjoy these 
Petra Kendall: 	few fragile moments with him before something else happens to
take him from her again::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Stares deep into her eyes and kisses the tip of her
nose:: I love you more than anything ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	Petra, and I always will.
Petra Kendall: 	(s) I love you too, Gabriel...far more than my own life.
::she shivers at the gentle kiss 
Petra Kendall: 	and curls into his arms once more, a sweet warmth filling her
tiny form as she melts against
Petra Kendall: 	him::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Kisses her lips, raising her head by her chin he kisses
her deeply and full of love and ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	passion, his hands sliding to rest on her rear again and
fingers twirl across her skin~
Gabriel Prophet: 	in light gentle circles::
Petra Kendall: 	::a shudder wracks her diminuitive frame and a ragged groan
erupts from her lips past his 
Petra Kendall: 	kiss; her pale skin flushes with a heat that has nothing at
all to do with the shower, and 
Petra Kendall: 	if she pressed herself any closer to him, she might well
merge with him completely::
Gabriel Prophet: 	I want you... ::his voice escapes ragged and breathless,
his arms lift her closer to him, ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	powerful arms cradling her against him::
Petra Kendall: 	<w> Oh...gods, yes...please, my love...  ::So long...how long
has it been?  Too long.  She
Petra Kendall: 	wraps her slim legs around his waist, her hips pressed firmly
and warmly against his taut, 
Petra Kendall: 	washboard abdomen, then winds her arms around his shoulders::
<w> Fill me with you, my 
Petra Kendall: 	love...we have all these empty bedrooms to fill...
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Lifts her gentle form and sets her Down onto him as he
slides into her, hands clenched on~
Gabriel Prophet: 	her backside and beginning a rythmic motion::
Petra Kendall: 	::All the air escapes her lungs as he simply slides into her,
her arms tightening around his
Petra Kendall: 	shoulders with a shudder, eyes squeezing closed.  Her lips
press tightly together to hold 
Petra Kendall: 	back the sounds she wants to make, her spine arching as her
head falls backward, wet 
Petra Kendall: 	tendrils of silk plastered against her slender back::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Noticing her lips pressed together and smiles:: Don't
hold back angel... we are all alone~
Gabriel Prophet: 	for miles... let go all you want my precious angel... ::HIs
head dips so his lips can kiss ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	along her neck and nip at her flesh::
Petra Kendall: 	::his lips brand hot trails along her neck and she moans
raggedly, the sound uneven and 
Petra Kendall: 	thready, her hips moving in slowly undulating waves against
his own, feeling him slide in 
Petra Kendall: 	and out of her.  The sensation is enough to make her mind
whirl, her head spin, and her 
Petra Kendall: 	breathing becomes erratic:: <w> Please...god...
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Hands bring her roughly onto him over and over, for what
seems like an eternity the two ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	are twisted in a carnal dance, finally he presses her back
to the shower wall and explodes ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	inside of her, his hot fluid letting loose::
Petra Kendall: 	::She whimpers as she feels him erupt inside her, her head
falling forward onto his 
Petra Kendall: 	shoulder, her fingers pressing into his flesh as she gasps,
shaking as he climaxes::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Strong arms continue to churn her against him like a
machine, his erection throbbing ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	inside of her as he finishes his orgasm and continues, as
he continues he becomes a bit ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	more primal::
Petra Kendall: 	::She squeezes her eyes shut, remembering the last time they
were locked together like this,
Petra Kendall: 	and her legs tighten around his waist, feeling him slide even
deeper into her, seemingly 
Petra Kendall: 	untiring, unstoppable, until at last she moans and goes rigid
in his arms, head falling
Petra Kendall: 	back, her eyes glazed as every muscle in her tiny form goes
rigid with the power of the 
Petra Kendall: 	ecstasy filling her like white light and fierce fire::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Powerful arms bringing her to him again and again, not
ever wanting this to stop... just ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	wanting to stay inside her forever.  Over and over her
brings her down onto him or while ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	her back is braced against the wall he lifts his hips to
thrust up into her::
Petra Kendall: 	::Her heart stutters as he pushes into her again, not
stopping, driving her to a new and 
Petra Kendall: 	higher plane of ecstasy; her slick inner walls clutch so
tightly around him that he seems 
Petra Kendall: 	caught in a beartrap, but without pain.  her tiny nipples
scrape across his broad, hard 
Petra Kendall: 	chest, and the hiss of the shower does not drown out the
liquid sounds made as their hips 
Petra Kendall: 	churn together::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Further burrying into her and once again his member
throbs and sprays inside her, his ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	lets out a deep raspy moan and his head drops to rest on
her shoulder and his teeth nibble ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	at the flesh of her neck::
Petra Kendall: 	<w> Oh god...ggg....  ::her breath catches in her throat as
she shakes underneath him, 
Petra Kendall: 	almost violently enough to shake herself apart as she
climaxes again, the pupils of her eyes
Petra Kendall: 	dilated to huge black discs, every inch of her tiny frame
pressed against him::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::The hot liquid finally stops and his rythm slows down
though it doesn't stop, his knees ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	are getting weak so he slides down the wall until he is on
his back on the ample floor of ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	the shower and his arms still bring her down onto him...
slow steady and loving::
Petra Kendall: 	::she seems amazed that he does not diminish, though her
knowledge of the subject is 
Petra Kendall: 	admittedly scant; still, she braces herself against his
shoulders, trying to match his 
Petra Kendall: 	stamina, though she knows she cannot, especially as weak as
she is.  She thinks she can last
Petra Kendall: 	for another time, two at the most, before her energies fail
her and she is reduced to either
Petra Kendall: 	falling asleep...or worse, just laying there::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Will eventually wear down after one more run through,
collapsing in the shower floor ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	panting, hos body giving off tremendous amounts of heat and
he lays there kissing her::
Petra Kendall: 	::She shudders, nearly insensate, laying in his arms like a
puddle of melted chocolate, 
Petra Kendall: 	breathing raggedly as he kisses her, her eyes dazed with
splinters of white light from all 
Petra Kendall: 	the rapture he has shared with her tonight::
Gabriel Prophet: 	IS.... that a good.... start to get that plan of filling
rooms.... of this big house?
Petra Kendall: 	<w> Oh, yes, my love...beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Gabriel Prophet: 	I love you baby.... 
Petra Kendall: 	<w> I love you, my dearest...now and forever.
