	Once again, total darkness, total lack of anything around me...  Just me, just this light I hold in my hands as if my faith and belief were no longer held within.  If I strain my ears I can hear the Angels above singing in the light, a soft heaven in my hands.   How did I get here?  Why am I standing on this rock outcropping in the middle of nowhere, over a chasm that seems to have no bottom because it stretches into the great expanse of the universe?  Stars and planets at my back like I'm at some freakish IMAX show.  Who am I holding back, and from what?  Am I all that stands between this roiling blackness and Earth?  Is this the last bastion of goodness, and is that hell before me?</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>All I hear is the voice surrounding me, lifting me once again in it's graceful tones, the deep comforting voice long unheard so clearly.  His voice wrapped me in light and and a neverending sense of happiness and contentment.  Once again I felt the closeness to God that I had missed in long past ages, you see I left Heaven.  I wasn't cast out mind you, but I wanted to see what living the life of one of his created children was like.  The free will of man is quite the double edged sword, it breeds cynicism and doubt in all minds.  I forgot who I was, but he came to me, found me living the life of a married man with a beautiful and gentle woman.  He didn't judge me for my choices, but he was sorrowful that I had lost my mortality to aome supernatural virus...  I was no longer the Angel I once was...  I once led the hosts of Heaven like a mighty general...  Now I'm a man.<BR>

	Something about this light holds my mind and prevents my rage from overtaking me, here they come again and I have changed to the battle form of our kind.  They throw themselves at me and the light, only to die in disgusting heaps at my feet.  These pathetic demons, once angels like I was, their fall left them twisted and apalling.  They looked all for the world like some cross of a locust, mantis, and grasshopper, oh... and a humanoid.  Truly sad they are.  Time here is convoluted, I haven't sleep though I know it's been days, maybe even weeks.  The light sustains me, no food or water do I need, and I hardly tire.  <BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"I need you Gabriel, long have you been absent from my host, we all miss your presence among us.  We miss your songs and cheer, your strength and conviction.  I'm calling on you for assistance once again Gabriel, we need you."  His voice so calming and soothing, how could anyone turn their back on that warmth and comfort?  <BR>
	"Yes Lord, I miss being among you all as well.  I am happy and content here, but the wonders of heaven...   What do you require of me Oh Lord?"  What would I tell Petra?<BR>
	"The Fallen have found a way to freely enter the world without need for a host, without posession.  I need you to stop them Gabriel, even as you are you are still the strongest on Earth and in Heaven. "  How could I refuse?  To once again come to the call of my God and do his will.  <BR>
	"Lead the way Father"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	When I arrived on this outcropping I was in the rage form, wearing the dress that I had in heaven, the raiment of the host.  I held my sword, the Sword of the ArchAngel Gabriel, how this would destroy anyone else who even tried to lift it.  It felt good to be here, but where was here?  <BR>
