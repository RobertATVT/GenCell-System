	Once again, total darkness, total lack of anything around me...  Just me, just this light I hold in my hands as if my faith and belief were no longer held within.  If I strain my ears I can hear the Angels above singing in the light, a soft heaven in my hands.   How did I get here?  Why am I standing on this rock outcropping in the middle of nowhere, over a chasm that seems to have no bottom because it stretches into the great expanse of the universe?  Stars and planets at my back like I'm at some freakish IMAX show.  Who am I holding back, and from what?  Am I all that stands between this roiling blackness and Earth?  Is this the last bastion of goodness, and is that hell before me?</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>All I hear is the voice surrounding me, lifting me once again in it's graceful tones, the deep comforting voice long unheard so clearly.  His voice wrapped me in light and and a neverending sense of happiness and contentment.  Once again I felt the closeness to God that I had missed in long past ages, you see I left Heaven.  I wasn't cast out mind you, but I wanted to see what living the life of one of his created children was like.  The free will of man is quite the double edged sword, it breeds cynicism and doubt in all minds.  I forgot who I was, but he came to me, found me living the life of a married man with a beautiful and gentle woman.  He didn't judge me for my choices, but he was sorrowful that I had lost my mortality to aome supernatural virus...  I was no longer the Angel I once was...  I once led the hosts of Heaven like a mighty general...  Now I'm a man.<BR>

	Something about this light holds my mind and prevents my rage from overtaking me, here they come again and I have changed to the battle form of our kind.  They throw themselves at me and the light, only to die in disgusting heaps at my feet.  These pathetic demons, once angels like I was, their fall left them twisted and apalling.  They looked all for the world like some cross of a locust, mantis, and grasshopper, oh... and a humanoid.  Truly sad they are.  Time here is convoluted, I haven't sleep though I know it's been days, maybe even weeks.  The light sustains me, no food or water do I need, and I hardly tire.  <BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"I need you Gabriel, long have you been absent from my host, we all miss your presence among us.  We miss your songs and cheer, your strength and conviction.  I'm calling on you for assistance once again Gabriel, we need you."  His voice so calming and soothing, how could anyone turn their back on that warmth and comfort?  <BR>
	"Yes Lord, I miss being among you all as well.  I am happy and content here, but the wonders of heaven...   What do you require of me Oh Lord?"  What would I tell Petra?<BR>
	"The Fallen have found a way to freely enter the world without need for a host, without posession.  I need you to stop them Gabriel, even as you are you are still the strongest on Earth and in Heaven. "  How could I refuse?  To once again come to the call of my God and do his will.  <BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	When I arrived on this outcropping I was in the rage form, wearing the dress that I had in heaven, the raiment of the host.  I held my sword, the Sword of the ArchAngel Gabriel, how this would destroy anyone else who even tried to lift it.  It felt good to be here, but where was here?  <BR>

	Shadows fall around me, a temptation pulling at my soul.  Things speak to me out of the void of dreams, voices cold and uncaring, whispering to me.  Each one of them lunge at me, attempting to scare me and break down my wits, but I won't fall.  I have more to contend with now, I have her to watch over.  The voices and calls that I have heard for so long are brushed aside, but each time I feel them growing stronger...  are they testing me?  What are they?   I bolster myself against the darkness and bring forth the image of my belief, the light begins to pour forth from me, almost physical and tangible.  I'm standing naked, as always, and perched upon the edge of a cliff.  They are out there, they are waiting to take me with them, to break the light inside me.  I cannot allow that for a multitude of reasons.	<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	I have visions while I bathe in this holy light, I have thoughts of myself moving through an ancient camp of men, each and every one of them dying as I pass, some running to attack me... they are no match for the blade forged by God that I carry...  They are no match for one of the Servitors of Heaven.  I was sent here to protect his people, to prevent them from getting slaughtered by this mighty army, and this army had been judged.  Judged to die by my hand.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	They are moving upon me again, but the light forces them back, it's writhing glow like a white hot plasma, moving as if alive to strike out at them.  I dare to look around, the landscape is bleak and barren, lifeless... nothing but rock and shale, and the darkness surrounding me.  Down below off the cliff I see stars, rolling all around and swirling... and a small blue orb, like the earth.  Far away...  Why am I hear of a sudden?  Is the darkness trying to get to the world, to flood it with it's horrific presence and condemn us to death?  <BR>

	Men pass around me, seeing nothing unusual, not even noticing me.  The sandles on my feet are uncomfortable and ill to walk in, but in this sandy dirty place it is a must.  Up ahead from me I see a woman, she is coming out of her husbands home, that of Joseph of Aramathea..  Her name was Mary, and although her marriage was not yet consecrated she was with child.  A child of divine providence, the Son of God.  I stopped her and asked her if I could have a word with her, so trusting she was.  We stepped to the side and I let drop my peasentries and showed her who I truly was, the wings unfurled from my back and she was bathed in the light of God.  <BR>
	"Mary, you are carrying a child...  this child is born of the Holy Spirit and your son will be the savior of his people.  Be careful with him, and worry not... Joseph will know of it by tomorrow.  God has special plans for you, trust in him."<BR>
	With those words I was airborn and fluttered away, a risky move considering the other denizens that prowled the streets of Galilea, but during the day the Soul-Drinkers would not be out and the Fallen would not dare to molest me...  I am God's greatest and most trusted.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	I could discern shapes in that roiling blackness that surrounded me, thousands... no... millions of horrific creatures clambered and crawled to get past me... a few did, but no more than one or two in any given burst.  Then it came, the most beautifully black creature I had ever laid eyes upon, his skin was marble smooth and white as alabaster, and as beautiful as anything that could be made.  Long had it been since I had gazed upon his face, for millenium I had battled him and his fallen.  But I was no longer the majestic Angel I had once been, I was locked into the form of a wolf...  Certainly this would be my ending.<BR>

	My mind raced with the anticipation of what was to come, and if this would be my final confrontation with this age old foe.  His minions swarmed around him like pestilance on the innocent face of a child, and he seemed dirty.  Never before have I ever seen this being so drawn and terrible, never so lacking the luster of the beauty he contained.  Something was dreadfully wrong, of that I was sure.  His movements were slow and ungainly and his eyes drooped in a terrible stupor.  Has he finally weakened?<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Once again I carry messages to prophets and seers, once again I am the Harbinger for the Almighty.  My task is simple, to carry portents and omens to those that will receive them and open the eyes of mankind.  From one great man to another I go, touching them with knowledge from on high.  Not all are the faithful middle world men and women of the bible, I appear in many guises to suit the needs of God's people.  To some simpler people I appear as various animals, here to guide them and teach them the ways.  To some I am a shining light in the daytime.  Each of them see me as they understand, and I leave them with a sliver of knowledge that they would have spent years finding.  I am Gabriel, Messenger of God.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The large statuesque figure lurched forward again, seemingly carried by the lesser minions that walled it in on both sides.  This all felt so very wrong, so very out of place.  Was it that I am no longer an Angel?  Could I fend them off with the light like I did in days long past?  I suppose I would find out soon enough.  I have already learned that while I hold this light a controlling peace washes over me and holds my mind in constant control.  I feel like more of a warrior than I ever have before, that was always Michaels job, he was the guardian when the Rising came... but where is he now?  Suddenly I felt a surge forward and lost my stomach to the rising sickness, and my eyes lifted amidst the gut wrenching heaves that shook my body.  That was the reason for the lurching movements, and the sagging eyes...  I wasn't looking at the Father of Lies at all...<BR>
	"Oh dear Father, save us all...."<BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Memories pass freely now, at least more than they have in the past 22 years.  I recall now who I am and what I once was.  How I came to be like this may forever remain a mystery, but for now I regret nothing.  I have Petra here, I have her love and the love of my Father.  If the rest of Heavens Host only knew the joy that anothers undying love can bring to you.  I also remember my brothers in heaven.  Michael, Raphael, Uriel, Sammael, all of us are the Arch Angels, the Principle Powers of the Choirs of Heaven.  We all have our duties to perform, some more tasking than others but none are unimportant in the scheme of things...  but Michael was the Warrior.  Michael would be the greatest and strongest of us all.  He was the guardian of Earth and stood with the light to keep the Darkness from spilling fully over into Earth and tearing it to shreds.  Michael was the last bastion of hope for the World.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"What have they done to you Michael?"  The sight before me was horrific at best.  Some foul despicable creatures must have finally overcome my brother and rent him asunder.  The beautiful alabaster figure that made it's way towards me was nothing more than the flesh of my brother stretched over puppet of sorts, and moved by the shambling horde of devils and imps that crawled over it like insects to a dying man.  The sight still sent gouts of bile from my lips, how could he have fallen?  How can I do anything to hold them back?  I am no match for Michael, I never have been a warrior like he was.  And there is his face, that beautiful visage crafted carefully by the Father himself... stretched across a mimic... made into a mask of taunting putresence.  And I grew angry, and I felt the rage, and I stayed controlled....  and now is the time to kill.<BR>

	The Control granted me by the light I held coursed through my mind in small tendrils of focusing strength, my resolve to stay in peace of mind engrained itself into my very being as a rage of sorts washed over me.  My form was that of battle and  and lept forward concentrating with the light that also sought it's own vengeance againt the blasphemies that had been committed against my brother.  With one motion I lept forward towards the coming onslaught, no longer caring about my own existance.  With one arc of my hand I could hear the choirs of heaven erupt into song, the light from the orb shooting out from me in an arc against the dark writhing mass of foesbefore me.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Another faded memory shoots back to me.  Michael was before me, getting himself ready for a confrontation, but there was a deeply sad look in his eyes.  He had always been what mortals would equate to a big brother and I was curious to what was going on.  He normally had this look of inspiration when he went off to war, most thought that it was unnatural.  He was created fur such things, but this time was different, he was troubled.<BR>
	"What's wrong Michael?  You seem troubled."  I swiftly moved up to him, always the fastest amongst my kind, it was my job... but with that came an endurance that only Michael could match, but when we lpayed around I could hit him three times or more for each one he delivered to me.  I like this whole war bit and even helped him on a few occasions, though he never wanted to take me... too worried that I would be hurt or destroyed.<BR>
	"Lucifer has arisen in anger and defiance, he is leading a faction against the Father, and we must put him down.  Gather your things, I have put some things aside for you.  Come now, it's time."  With that he lifted in a great flutter of motion and I shot up after him, easily dressing and catching him before he was more than 30 feet from me.  We rose upwards and as we did the sky had changed, the clouds had blackened and there were streaks of scarlet breaking through... and when we breached the cloudroof the world had changed for me.  Never would things be the same, once a time I had thought that war was nothing more than mortal savagery, but now...  it was horrifying.  The Father was surrounded by the beautiful warriors of our kind, his glow was a beacon of comfort to us, and Lucifer was the dark blight that had grown... already his wings had blackened, yet his face was eerily still as beautiful as ever.   But the war was horrifying.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Apparently they had enough as well and also charged me, a good quarter of them didn't live through the seering white light that pressed through they corrupt bodies.  They moved forward and gnashed and clawed at me like a swarm of rodents, yet I continued.  My claws tearing out as the lights begins to melt and slide along my body, running to coat my skin and fur in the light, making the whiteness of my being that much more bright, claws glowing with the radiance of heaven.  And with each swing that light woud seek out the foul spawn before me, one brothers in heaven these creatures were now nothing but insects.  One after another my blows struck forward, the arts of war that I had studied during my mortal time coming to me in full practice and my mind blurred in a frenzy of motion as I waded through them.  I would redeeem my fallen brother and put him to rest, in a place proper and with the ceremony needed...  this entire time... I've been groomed to take the place of my brother...  this was all a test.<BR>
	This form was harder to injure for thes imps and the light still worked with me in concert.  The whole of it placed me in a position to ravage the forces before me, all in a blood soaked frenzy of motion, the light trailing with each swipe of the talons, and my howls of rage mingled with the battle cry of the heavenly host as they sang for the redemtion of our lost brother... with each step the bodies grew around me, here they were more solid than spirits... here they could be mangled by hand... and mangle I did...  finally I made my way to my brother and flooded him in a was of the light, the blast tearing the "mimic" asunder and dropping his body into my arms...  The forces of darkness that remained had run off, they were pouring and popping away to run to their master...  some day I would face him.<BR>
	Michael's body laid broken in my arms, his face sullen and his limbs flayed in all the wrong directions... how could this happen?  I lifted him and began moving back to my perch, begging the light to bring him back to us...  but it didn't happen.  As I watched his body, sure that there was no life left in it, his hand lifted and touched my arm... soft and weak was his grip, his body ravaged by these blights.  The most wonderful thing was the smile on his face, nothing was more touching than when a loved one, father, or brother, looked to you with approval.  His face beemed with pride that I would be taking his place, that I would watch the rifts... I would carry the light.  His look also betrayed that he wanted me to avenge him,  and avenge him I would.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
