	"Carry me into the light Father so that me and my Angel can be together once again" His voice carried weakly across the ground.  Blood flowed from his lips and around him in a great pool as his broken body made one last desperate crawl to his beloved Petra.  Her skin was more pale than usual, she was dead at the hands of one of the Dark Ones.  His heart shattered today, and with it everything he knew and loved, one final kiss laid upon her child like lips before his world screemed to a seering and abrupt halt.  They had finished him.  His body was covering her protectively in a final embrace, lips pressed to hers as the jeering creatures put the final shot into his head.  Now there was only a cooling light before him, and the figures of his Angels beckoning him home, Solange and Petra radiant in their splintered innocence before him.  It was time, he had fought well for the side of Truth and Good, he only hoped that he made some difference.  Now it was time to accept their beckons and go to his Father.<BR>

	"Please Petra, go with them."  His voice was filled with worry and concern, his heart split between his decision that she would have to leave him, and that he may never see his love again.  Their Children were already safe and far from here, now it was time for her to join them.<BR>
<BR>
	"No Gabriel, I'm not leaving you to die here.  I won't lose you, please come with me."  Tears ran from her tiny gentle eyes in great streams as she clasped her arms around him.  Her fiery hair cut short in protest of this madness that her friends and family were clinging to.  Though no longer the tiny frail lady she once was, this war was too much for her.<BR>
<BR>
	" I can't, the pack needs me.  God has called me to fight here, and like David before me I will take that stand against adversity and win.  But I need you to be safe, I need a reason to fight Petra.  If I lose you, I will not be able to stand strong.  Please go, I love you so much much Angel."  Strong hands would loosen her from him, she would be passed kicking and screaming to those that would hide her and protect her from harm.  The Children were already in the Vatican City, this last bastion of hope for mankind.  <BR>

	What was once a center of peace had become a fortified castle of purity and faith.  Men and women alike were trained in the arts of combat, they were taught the secrets of the breeds and how to kill them.  Pope Innocent XII, once a man by the name Michaelangelo dei Conti rose once again into power in the latter part of 2007.  Long thought deceased since late 1730 he arose as the unkown Archangel of Rome, having fought down the Great Demon that manipulated most of Italy.  After his rebirth and re-acclamation to the Papal throne Innocent XIII declared Rome a safe haven for all those that would seek refuge from the Dark Ones spreading across the globe.  Shortly after the construction of the Vatican Monestary, a training ground for Hunters Pope Innocent XII made an earth shattering adrees on International Television.  No longer would the Catholic Church sit back and watch this evail spread across our Earth, the time for action was now.  <BR>
<BR>
	His radient immanence was seen by all speaking of an Army being trained in the Vatican, that this new order of militia would spread through the globe from monestary to monestary teaching those willing to combat corruption where it dwelled.  A time of Vigallence was upon us.  I felt like a new life was pressed into me.  My faith long since under pressure was re-affirmed by this new Pope, this Angel sent by God to reclaim what was good.<BR>
<BR>
	Not long after the Address, Father Angus was made a Bishop in the order of St. Michael.  He brought word to us of the new edict made by the Pope, all Werewolves, Psychics, and Mortal men that followed the tennants of God were absolved of all crimes during this war, and the Popes blessing was upon us.  <BR>
<BR>
	Through all of this, I worried for my Angel.  My Petra so far away in this strange land.  The Popes speech to the world made no mention of Angels, Demons, and the supernatural, this was to be kept a Secret.  We all knew what he meant though.    I worried for Petra's witchcraft however, I knew she was wise enough to stop it in their presence.  I prayed daily for her, little Jennifer, and Raphael.  My family.<BR>

	The news hit me like a 50 caliber bullet.  She had returned without warnign and was spotted being drug to an empty building by a Dark One.  Immediately I burst from the Foundry and Ran with all my strength to the building.  Damian tried to stop me, but I slipped past my Mentor and ran for everything I was worth.  The news had just come over the radio by one of our scouts, maybe I had time. <BR>
<BR>
	When I got to the burnt out remnants of the dojo, my ears cried with a lonely scream, he voice crying out in agony.  I was no Victor Martel, Andrew Briggs. Roland Deschain, or Rya Winter.  Damian taught me what he knew in what time we had for actual training, but I was weak compared to these heroes.  These men and women were the core of the resistance,  The Council of Light was still fighting because of their Valor.  <BR>
<BR>
	I pushed my way past the fallen timbers and into the dojo, and through the thick shadows I saw her body slumping from the the grasp of that disgusting creature, that Fanged Monstrosity we now only grace to call a Dark one.  Without warning I wrapped myself in the Cloak of the Wolf, my form unseen to this abomination.  Even as it attempted to wrap itself in it's own dark shell I swung the heavy blade.  One smooth motion of trained accuracy would be all I needed, the creatures neck gouted in a red spray of blood as it's head began to topple and in that same graceful fluidity I plunged the long shaft of wood into it's heart.  Death.  <BR>
<BR>
	I was about to make my way to her, to try and save her when three more of the creatures came out of the darkness to barrel me to the ground.  Rage over took me and I shifted froms while under them.  The first one drooled in sublime glee, thinking that they would have me so easily.  When it was all over and his comapnions pried his heart from my fist he would learn better.  I battled as long as I could and Howled from the depth of my chest, but there was no help to come, more and more of these ratlike vomitous creations came at me, I fought until the first five laid motionless at me feet.  <BR>
<BR>
	Nothing but silence now, they creatures fled, all but one ran off laughing into the night.  I payed him no heed as I saw Petra lying there, cold and pale.  The bitemarks on her neck and the dried blood speaking her fate.  One glance above to show the small Childlike form of Victor Martel Jr.  His eyes gleamed in the night, the color of blood.  Nothing but a child, he carried the lack of conscience that goes with being created into an evil thing and taught only hatred.  Poor Victor.<BR>
<BR>
	"Take a message to my father when you see him in hell Moon Lover.  Tell him that when he is long forgotten, I will be sure to piss on his Hall of Rubbish."  His small silvery voice chimed out in laughter as he watched me crawl to Petra, he at least gave me that solace before putting the silver laden shotgun to the back of my head and pulling th..............<BR>
