<BR>
<BR>
She waits for me at night, she waits for me in silence<BR>
She gives me all her tenderness and takes away my pain<BR>
And so far she hasn't run, though I swear she's had her moments<BR>
She still believes in miracles while others cry in vain<BR>
<BR>
It's all about soul<BR>
It's all about faith and a deeper devotion<BR>
It's all about soul<BR>
'Cause under the love is a stronger emotion<BR>
She's got to be strong<BR>
'Cause so many things getting out of control<BR>
Should drive her away<BR>
So why does she stay?<BR>
It's all about soul<BR>
<BR>
She turns to me sometimes and asks me what I'm dreaming<BR>
And I realize I must have gone a million miles away<BR>
And I ask her how she knew to reach out for me that moment<BR>
And she smiles because it's understood there are no words to say<BR>
<BR>
It's all about soul<BR>
It's all about knowing what someone is feeling<BR>
The woman's got soul<BR>
The power of love and the power of healing<BR>
This life isn't fair<BR>
It's gonna get dark, it's gonna get cold<BR>
You've got to be tough, but that ain't enough<BR>
It's all about soul<BR>
<BR>
There are people who have lost every trace of human kindness<BR>
There are many who have fallen, there are some who still survive<BR>
She comes to me at night and she tells me her desires<BR>
And she gives me all the love I need to keep my faith alive<BR>
<BR>
It's all about soul<BR>
It's all about joy that comes out of sorrow<BR>
It's all about soul<BR>
Who's standing now and who's standing tomorrow<BR>
You've got to be hard<BR>
Hard as the rock in that old rock 'n' roll song<BR>
But that's only part, you know in your heart<BR>
It's all about soul...</I></HTML>
