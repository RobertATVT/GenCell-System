3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Gabriel is wanting to provide a secluded home for the two of them that is away from town and provides privacy from all the odd happenings in their lives.  A new unlisted number and a new beginning for them both.  This will be the Prophet Estate, a Neo-Roman home of immense proportions.  The house is built on the hill overlooking Voletta <BR>
and has a newly paved road going to it.  The Estate itself is centered in a clearing with four guest houses coming off each corner.  The guest houses are all three bedroom places that follow the large open styling of the classic Roman architecture, where the romans would have large open columned walls, this has glass in the open spaces.  The interior walls are spackled and designed with wall brazier fixtures (halogen) and all the modern comforts done in a fashion to keep with the Romanesque theme.  <BR>
	The main house is a ten bedroom estate with the same styling, one of the rooms is the decadent Master Bedroom with antique styling and large open areas... also included is a rather large whirlpool bath for relaxation.  All of the lights and such come from braziers and wall sconce type fixtures that blend with the roman style, the couches are low swept back single person (two if they are real friendly) loungers, not the large modern couches.  The Beds and dressers are all four poster beds with curtains that may be drawn for privacy and the furniture is a simple yet elegant creation.  All in all the Estate is large and homey, yet done with marbles, sandstone, granite and several other classy materials.<BR>

The Estate has been worked on since late November of 1999 and was completed on February 10th, 2000.  The money to front this came to the amount of 32 million, which has been rolled for and posted.<BR>
