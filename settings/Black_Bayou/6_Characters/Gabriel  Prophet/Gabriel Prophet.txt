</B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

<B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

Gabriel is a tall man standing 6 feet, 6 inches.  His hair is is a very light platinum blonde, mostly white which stands defiently on end in a very styled spike, side kept shaved short and trimmed.  His eyes are the most striking feature about him.  Like the crystal blue Ice of a glacial mountain his eyes seem to stare out from his travel worn and tanned face.  Powerfully built and toned to perfection, he commands attention with a voice like the rolling seas and walks with a peace about him.<BR>

Born to Norma and Maxwell Kingston in the Fall of 1976, Gabriel Kinston was a gift child.  His mother thought barren and his father on the verge of adoption, Gabriel has come without warning or expectaion.  Filled with joy his parents named him after Gods most favored and beloved angel Gabriel, his voice and courier thought the heavens.  Gabriel was a beautiful child with a peaceful temperment and seemed a child of miracles.  His eyes spoke volumes of mystery and past, and his talents lied in both leadership and the arts.  In church his voice carried high and wonderous, and at schoold he excelled in all of his subjects.  By the time Gabriel was in High School he was an up and coming sports star, most likely to succeed.  He led his fellow youth in prayer and conviction, and spent his life studying his faith in god and his obsession with angels.  By the time he graduated he was lined up for scholarships for everything from his sports to his grades, his community achievements and the things he did in the private sector to help out those less fortunate.  All around Gabriel had been a wonder to his parents, to those whose life he touched.  One day however his faith would be put to test.  When he had turned 21 Gabriel had decided to go to New Orleans during Mardi Gras to spread the word of God to the lost, it was a pilgramage of sorts for him, a calling.  He didn't know why Mardi Gras, he didin't know where, he just knew to go there.  And he did.  The realization of the decadence and horrors that he saw drove him crying into the night, lost in the small winding backroads of New Orleans.  And he fell and cried to the heavens in anguish, afraid that some dark seed was to be opened in him.  And he was lost, and afraid for the first real time in his life, hunkered down in the filth of all that is Mardi Gras.  But a light shined on him, and slowly he looked up, expecting to see a policeman to cart him off to the drunk tank.  This light however came to him in a warmth of love and care, this was the light of heaven shed from the wings on an angel.  She looked down upon him and touched the sweaty and filth covered crown of his head, and her voice rang forth like the silver drops of a waterfall. "Stand Gabriel, you must be strong...  you must not fear those that are to be saved, their iniquity shall not touch you.  You are a follower of the light, and must go forth into the darkest corners carried by your own faith and guided by your inner strength.  Now go and free them."  And suddenly she was gone... his Angel.  all that was left was an ever warm, ever glowing feather that fell from her wings... perhaps left to give him strength.  And go he did, and to Voletta he has come.<BR>
