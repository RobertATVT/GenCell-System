Gabriel Prophet: 	::Comes home after a long morning of house building to
check on Petra and get some lunch ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	the bike roaring to a stop outside the apartment building
and he begins walking to the door:
PetraKndll: 	::Breaded pork chops are lifted out of the oven pan and set onto
a plate, along with rice 
PetraKndll: 	pilaf and steamed asparagus.  the table is set, a single candle
gleaming in the center of 
PetraKndll: 	the snowy tablecloth, and she shuts the oven off::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::The door is opened with a wave of smells hitting him, and
a smile and deep breath is taken
Gabriel Prophet: 	as he enters the Apartment grinning from ear to ear::
Petra?
PetraKndll: 	(s) In here, my love.  ::last to be set on the table is a loaf
of golden, freshly-baked, 
PetraKndll: 	home-made bread, hot out of the oven and split down the center,
slathered with melting 
PetraKndll: 	butter::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::lays down his tools belt as he enters and takes off the
steel toes work boots:: Well I was
Gabriel Prophet: 	going to see if you wanted to go out for lunch with me, but
this is much better.
PetraKndll: 	::she smiles at him gently as she steps over to where he sits
and slides her arms around his
PetraKndll: 	shoulders from behind:: (s) How has work gone so far, my love?
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Cracks his neck back and forth, his muscles taught and
steely::  It is going well, we got~
Gabriel Prophet: 	three more done this week.  I think I had best take a quick
shower before I eat.  I am a bit
Gabriel Prophet: 	on the icky side this afternoon <g>
PetraKndll: 	(s) All right, Gabriel...the food will stay warm.  ::she
giggles::  You -are- the slightest 
PetraKndll: 	bit...whiffy.  ::her eyes twinkle mischievously::  But it's a
manly smell.
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Chuckles and turns around to kiss her then winks and
meanders away to the bathroom turning
Gabriel Prophet: 	the water on in the shower and gathering some clothes::
Want to come in here and chat while
Gabriel Prophet: 	I shower?
PetraKndll: 	(s) I'd like that a lot...  ::she pauses, thinking about it,
studying him for a moment.  
PetraKndll: 	even as she speaks, a blush tinges her cheeks:: (s) You know
what I'd like more?
Gabriel Prophet: 	What's that Angel? ::Steps into the bathroom and shuts the
door but for a crack, and begins
Gabriel Prophet: 	to get undressed::
PetraKndll: 	::she leans close to the bathroom door, face pressed to the
crack but not peeking through at
PetraKndll: 	him:: (sw) I'd like to come in there and help you wash...
Gabriel Prophet: 	<q> You want to take a shower with me?
PetraKndll: 	(sw) Yes...is that wrong?  
Gabriel Prophet: 	No, I would like that.
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Pulls the door open slowly and smiles at her::
PetraKndll: 	::she steps inside, face bright scarlet, looking up at him
tentatively.  She wants him, so 
PetraKndll: 	badly, all the time now...heart, mind, body, and soul...but she
does not want him to think 
PetraKndll: 	less of her for that::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Smiles and begins to help her remove her clothes, piece
by piece slowly::
PetraKndll: 	::she slides the skirt down over her narrow hips, tugs the shirt
off over her head, and 
PetraKndll: 	steps out of her plain white cotton panties, standing before him
as naked as the day she was
PetraKndll: 	born::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Was already undressed so he takes her hand and pulls her
into the shower with him, the ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	slightly hot water making his deeply tanned skin seem so
blush red::
PetraKndll: 	::she arches a little as the hot water drenches her, wetting the
red-gold mane to dark 
PetraKndll: 	amber, and wiggles as the beads of water glide over her slender
white form as she slides the
PetraKndll: 	shower stall door shut::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::places his back against the nozzle to shield her from the
water a little smiling down to 
Gabriel Prophet: 	her with the warmest sincerity::  Is the temperature
alright?
PetraKndll: 	(s) It's fine...I like it hot...I seem to get cold awfully easy.
::she reaches for the 
PetraKndll: 	washcloth and bar of soap::
Gabriel Prophet: 	Well, then I need to be home more often to warm you. ::His
body covered with the sooty 
Gabriel Prophet: 	coloring of a carpenter, pencil shavings and sawdust
mingled with the sweat of a days labor:
PetraKndll: 	::she lathers the washcloth up with the sweet, apple-scented
soap, then begins to drag it 
PetraKndll: 	across the broad, hard muscles of his chest, face a bit
pink--whether from heat or her own 
PetraKndll: 	audacity, it is hard to say--and she looks up at him with a shy
smile::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::places his hand on the side of her face and leans down to
kiss her lightly on the lips:: ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	Thank you for everything my love.
PetraKndll: 	::She smiles in pure pleasure at his gentle words and returns
the kiss with fierce ardor, 
PetraKndll: 	then slips around between him and the wall to wash his back, the
cloth leaving a trail of 
PetraKndll: 	creamy foam across his shoulders::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Stretches his muscels under the heat and her tender
administration, her light~
Gabriel Prophet: 	touch sending shivers through him and he closes his eyes
and places his hands on the wall of
Gabriel Prophet: 	the rather amply sized statt and leans sighing content and
happily::
PetraKndll: 	::she stands on tiptoe to wash the tops of his shoulders,
sliding the cloth over the back of
PetraKndll: 	his neck, then down again over corded muscles and warm flesh,
over his hips, then his
PetraKndll: 	backside, face redder than ever::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Lets out another sigh then turns around placing a hand on
the wall behind her to each side
Gabriel Prophet: 	of her, hands braced and he looks down at her smiling
warmly:: Now it is my turn... <g>
PetraKndll: 	(s) I...hadn't finished.  ::her eyes dart downward, then up
again, and she blushes all the 
PetraKndll: 	more, but smiles::
Gabriel Prophet: 	Alright, by all means finish, I am at your disposal my
angel, I am in your good hands.
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Smiles and stands up placing his hands out from his hips
in a surrendering fashion::
PetraKndll: 	::she lays the washcloth aside and begins to lather her tiny
hands, until they are slicked 
PetraKndll: 	with a thick layer of soapy foam.  at last, she sets the bar of
soap aside and her hands 
PetraKndll: 	drop down to his groin, curling through the thatch there, then
around his member, fondling 
PetraKndll: 	and spreading the soap gently::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::eyes flutter for a second and a deep breath is taken.  He
closes his eyes and leans his ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	head back a slight groan released as she lather his up.  A
hand moves to the back of her 
Gabriel Prophet: 	head and runs through the thick amber mass of her hair and
a firm grasp is taken::
PetraKndll: 	::she gasps a little and her fingers tighten around him, feeling
him harden.  her curiosity 
PetraKndll: 	is insatiable; she had not yet, in the handful of times that
they've been together, really 
PetraKndll: 	taken the opportunity to study him closely, much less touch him
like this.  now she is, and 
PetraKndll: 	he feels very nice, indeed::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::feeling his blood rush to his loins, the heat building
inside him he reaches forward and 
Gabriel Prophet: 	places his hand on her chest, running it along her small
breasts and feeling her pink 
Gabriel Prophet: 	nipples harden under his hands.  He opens his eyes and
gazes at her, his tiny angel, his one
Gabriel Prophet: 	love:: <q> I love you.
PetraKndll: 	(s) I love you, too...  ::her thumb lifts, grazing the tip of
him, silken as it slides over 
PetraKndll: 	the froth of suds, and she shudders as he touches her, a pulling
fire blooming in the pit of
PetraKndll: 	her belly::
Gabriel Prophet: 	<qw>> I want you so badly Petra, even when I am out there
on a roof working all I can think 
Gabriel Prophet: 	about is you.  About feelin you in my arms, and loving you.
PetraKndll: 	(s) I...can't think about anything but you any more,
Gabriel...even when I'm singing, all I 
PetraKndll: 	can see is you...touching me, whispering to me, kissing me,
holding me.
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Lets the water begin to wash the soap from him as he
turns her so that they are both side~
Gabriel Prophet: 	ways to the oncoming flow of steaming water, then both
hands slide slowly down her body to ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	her backside giving it a gentle squeeze while his lips seek
out her in a passionate kiss::
PetraKndll: 	::she moans, very softly, into his parted lips, and winds her
arms around him, hands rising 
PetraKndll: 	away from his manhood as she presses herself against him:: <w>
Love me...
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Moving to nibble softly on her ear he whisper in a low
soft rumble:: gladly...  :: with ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	strong arms he lifts her off her feet running her body
against his own as he does till he 
Gabriel Prophet: 	has her cradled to his waist, keeping the kiss drawn as he
sucks her small tongue between 
Gabriel Prophet: 	his lips and plays his own across it::
PetraKndll: 	::her tongue duels with his as she braces her hands on his
shoulders, one arm around them, 
PetraKndll: 	the other sliding up into his hair, eyes closed as she meets his
passion with her own fierce
PetraKndll: 	ardor::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::lifts her once more so that he can slide himself into her
slowly and gently as usual, 
Gabriel Prophet: 	still afraid that he will hurt her.  And begins a slow
loving rythm, lifting her till he is 
Gabriel Prophet: 	nearly out of her and lowering her untill he is deep within
her, his ands firmly holding ~
Gabriel Prophet: 	onto her buttocks as her legs wraps around his waist::
PetraKndll: 	::he fills her up, so fully, and she groans in wild rapture as
she feels herself lifted, 
PetraKndll: 	stretched, held close; her legs tighten around him as she rides
him, the water splashing 
PetraKndll: 	over them, her soft, thin cries filling the humid air in the
shower::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::LEts out a grown as her legs tighten against him and
speeds the rythm to a slightly faster
Gabriel Prophet: 	pace, kissing her so passionate it borders on brutal as he
breath quickens and his heart 
Gabriel Prophet: 	speeds::
PetraKndll: 	::her lips sting under his kiss, but she is so enmeshed in blind
passion that she doesn't 
PetraKndll: 	notice.  her head tilts back as he plunges into her, and she
groans in utter ecstasy, right 
PetraKndll: 	there...at...the...peak--her breath hisses in through flared
nostrils and she goes rigid in 
PetraKndll: 	his arms as she climaxes::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::HEars her gasping breath, and feels the warmth around
him.  His own already on it ways and
Gabriel Prophet: 	all it takes is another quick motions and she is lifted out
of his as his swollen head pulls
Gabriel Prophet: 	free and his climax is quickly washed away by the water
splashing across them::
PetraKndll: 	::her eyes widen as she watches him climax, for the first time
the act not hidden by a towel
PetraKndll: 	or cloth, and she glances up at him as the milky seed slides
down the drain, feeling weak 
PetraKndll: 	and warm and limp and sated::
Gabriel Prophet: 	::Holds her to him, still laying kisses across her face,
neck and chest in utter joy at the
Gabriel Prophet: 	act they have taken in again.  Knowing that he will never
be sated with her, he will always 
Gabriel Prophet: 	want her with every waking breath::
OnlineHost: 	PetraKndll has left the room.
