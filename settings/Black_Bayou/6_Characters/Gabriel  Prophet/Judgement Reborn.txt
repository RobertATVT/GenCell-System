	The Control granted me by the light I held coursed through my mind in small tendrils of focusing strength, my resolve to stay in peace of mind engrained itself into my very being as a rage of sorts washed over me.  My form was that of battle and  and lept forward concentrating with the light that also sought it's own vengeance againt the blasphemies that had been committed against my brother.  With one motion I lept forward towards the coming onslaught, no longer caring about my own existance.  With one arc of my hand I could hear the choirs of heaven erupt into song, the light from the orb shooting out from me in an arc against the dark writhing mass of foesbefore me.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Another faded memory shoots back to me.  Michael was before me, getting himself ready for a confrontation, but there was a deeply sad look in his eyes.  He had always been what mortals would equate to a big brother and I was curious to what was going on.  He normally had this look of inspiration when he went off to war, most thought that it was unnatural.  He was created fur such things, but this time was different, he was troubled.<BR>
	"What's wrong Michael?  You seem troubled."  I swiftly moved up to him, always the fastest amongst my kind, it was my job... but with that came an endurance that only Michael could match, but when we lpayed around I could hit him three times or more for each one he delivered to me.  I like this whole war bit and even helped him on a few occasions, though he never wanted to take me... too worried that I would be hurt or destroyed.<BR>
	"Lucifer has arisen in anger and defiance, he is leading a faction against the Father, and we must put him down.  Gather your things, I have put some things aside for you.  Come now, it's time."  With that he lifted in a great flutter of motion and I shot up after him, easily dressing and catching him before he was more than 30 feet from me.  We rose upwards and as we did the sky had changed, the clouds had blackened and there were streaks of scarlet breaking through... and when we breached the cloudroof the world had changed for me.  Never would things be the same, once a time I had thought that war was nothing more than mortal savagery, but now...  it was horrifying.  The Father was surrounded by the beautiful warriors of our kind, his glow was a beacon of comfort to us, and Lucifer was the dark blight that had grown... already his wings had blackened, yet his face was eerily still as beautiful as ever.   But the war was horrifying.<BR>

They moved forward and gnashed and clawed at me like a swarm of rodents, yet I continued.  My claws tearing out as the lights begins to melt and slide along my body, running to coat my skin and fur in the light, making the whiteness of my being that much more bright, claws glowing with the radiance of heaven.  And with each swing that light woud seek out the foul spawn before me, one brothers in heaven these creatures were now nothing but insects.  One after another my blows struck forward, the arts of war that I had studied during my mortal time coming to me in full practice and my mind blurred in a frenzy of motion as I waded through them.  I would redeeem my fallen brother and put him to rest, in a place proper and with the ceremony needed...  this entire time... I've been groomed to take the place of my brother...  this was all a test.<BR>
	This form was harder to injure for thes imps and the light still worked with me in concert.  The whole of it placed me in a position to ravage the forces before me, all in a blood soaked frenzy of motion, the light trailing with each swipe of the talons, and my howls of rage mingled with the battle cry of the heavenly host as they sang for the redemtion of our lost brother... with each step the bodies grew around me, here they were more solid than spirits... here they could be mangled by hand... and mangle I did...  finally I made my way to my brother and flooded him in a was of the light, the blast tearing the "mimic" asunder and dropping his body into my arms...  The forces of darkness that remained had run off, they were pouring and popping away to run to their master...  some day I would face him.<BR>
	Michael's body laid broken in my arms, his face sullen and his limbs flayed in all the wrong directions... how could this happen?  I lifted him and began moving back to my perch, begging the light to bring him back to us...  but it didn't happen.  As I watched his body, sure that there was no life left in it, his hand lifted and touched my arm... soft and weak was his grip, his body ravaged by these blights.  The most wonderful thing was the smile on his face, nothing was more touching than when a loved one, father, or brother, looked to you with approval.  His face beemed with pride that I would be taking his place, that I would watch the rifts... I would carry the light.  His look also betrayed that he wanted me to avenge him,  and avenge him I would.</HTML>
