	Shadows fall around me, a temptation pulling at my soul.  Things speak to me out of the void of dreams, voices cold and uncaring, whispering to me.  Each one of them lunge at me, attempting to scare me and break down my wits, but I won't fall.  I have more to contend with now, I have her to watch over.  The voices and calls that I have heard for so long are brushed aside, but each time I feel them growing stronger...  are they testing me?  What are they?   I bolster myself against the darkness and bring forth the image of my belief, the light begins to pour forth from me, almost physical and tangible.  I'm standing naked, as always, and perched upon the edge of a cliff.  They are out there, they are waiting to take me with them, to break the light inside me.  I cannot allow that for a multitude of reasons.	<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	I have visions while I bathe in this holy light, I have thoughts of myself moving through an ancient camp of men, each and every one of them dying as I pass, some running to attack me... they are no match for the blade forged by God that I carry...  They are no match for one of the Servitors of Heaven.  I was sent here to protect his people, to prevent them from getting slaughtered by this mighty army, and this army had been judged.  Judged to die by my hand.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

I dare to look around, the landscape is bleak and barren, lifeless... nothing but rock and shale, and the darkness surrounding me.  Down below off the cliff I see stars, rolling all around and swirling... and a small blue orb, like the earth.  Far away...  Why am I hear of a sudden?  Is the darkness trying to get to the world, to flood it with it's horrific presence and condemn us to death?  <BR>

	Men pass around me, seeing nothing unusual, not even noticing me.  The sandles on my feet are uncomfortable and ill to walk in, but in this sandy dirty place it is a must.  Up ahead from me I see a woman, she is coming out of her husbands home, that of Joseph of Aramathea..  Her name was Mary, and although her marriage was not yet consecrated she was with child.  A child of divine providence, the Son of God.  I stopped her and asked her if I could have a word with her, so trusting she was.  We stepped to the side and I let drop my peasentries and showed her who I truly was, the wings unfurled from my back and she was bathed in the light of God.  <BR>
	"Mary, you are carrying a child...  this child is born of the Holy Spirit and your son will be the savior of his people.  Be careful with him, and worry not... Joseph will know of it by tomorrow.  God has special plans for you, trust in him."<BR>
	With those words I was airborn and fluttered away, a risky move considering the other denizens that prowled the streets of Galilea, but during the day the Soul-Drinkers would not be out and the Fallen would not dare to molest me...  I am God's greatest and most trusted.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	I could discern shapes in that roiling blackness that surrounded me, thousands... no... millions of horrific creatures clambered and crawled to get past me... a few did, but no more than one or two in any given burst.  Then it came, the most beautifully black creature I had ever laid eyes upon, his skin was marble smooth and white as alabaster, and as beautiful as anything that could be made.  Long had it been since I had gazed upon his face, for millenium I had battled him and his fallen.  But I was no longer the majestic Angel I had once been, I was locked into the form of a wolf...  Certainly this would be my ending.<BR>
