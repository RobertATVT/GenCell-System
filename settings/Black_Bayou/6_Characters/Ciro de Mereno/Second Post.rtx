<BR>
Glacial eyes look around him to see a barren wasteland of petrified earth.<BR>
<BR>
He can feel his skin burning as wave after wave of firy air blast across his naked body.<BR>
<BR>
Then comes the darkness, the harsh sun shut off with an amazing suddeness and the world became cold and grey.<BR>
<BR>
Shingles of soot colored earth rose from the ground threatening to throw him from his feet.<BR>
<BR>
The great neck of a beast rose under his feet and roared into the night, he stood on the back of the beast and looked out at the scene of devastation around him.&nbsp; Bodies piled on great burning pires, buildings crushed like toys around him.<BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mind throbbed in sharp agony, burning from the inside like some torturous device had been dug deep into his mind.&nbsp; He rolled towards the edge of the bed, falling to the floor as the silk blankets pulled at him as if trying to keep him from escaping their clutches.&nbsp; He looked up to get his bearings, his mind fogged by the dream and the pain, but all he saw were the shadows staring back at him with great lidless pools of inky despair.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His breath came in great gasps and he could feel a wetness across his lips, and taste the iron rich flavor of blood.&nbsp; He began to pull himself to his feet, his legs watery and weak threatened to throw him to the floor in defiance, and he stumbled towards the next solid object for support.&nbsp; He could hear a chattering in the distance, not in any single direction but from all at once, it rose in volumes to smash against him like a great wave breaking against stone cliffs.&nbsp; The sudden rush of sound stripped what balance he had from him and sent him toppling to the floor, as he fell the darkness around him began to pull away and change, then with a sharp jerk of his head everything blared in an intense whiteness, and it was all gone.</FONT></HTML>
