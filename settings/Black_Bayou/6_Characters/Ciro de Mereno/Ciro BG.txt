	Ciro de Moreno, not an uncommon name for his homeland.  The northern regions of Spain held true to the old things in the world.  On the surface Ciro was a normal child, playful, joyful, everything that seemed right in a child.  Upon deeper inspection however, one would see certain odd characteristics of the child.  His eyes were colder than the rich sea blue that ran in his family.  His eyes were like chips of glacial ice, cold and calculating, not warm and inviting like the family trait that had held true for generations.  This was discounted though, certainly this meant he was special, but was it a good thing?<BR>

	Ciro was named for the meaning in his name, Bringer of Light, his family training on the small boy's odd eyes.  Through adolescance Ciro had been a quiet child, highly educated,  and pampered.  He never spoke more than a few sentances a day, and when possible he went off to read or spend time alone.  His family attributed it to his "quiet contemplative nature", little did they know that they were almost correct there.  His mind worked unlike others of his age, two or three times his age even.<BR>

	He grew older and still his demeanor remained like ice, his heart  distant and lacking warmth.  The rest of his physical qualities grew parallel with that of his family, he grew tall, his skin a deep incredible bronze, and his hair black as the night.  He was physically well shaped, perfectly built in every way.  <BR>

	As he grew he was a soul split, great power crackled at his fingertips, if he could only control and harness it, and his eyes were the portal into a darker soul, like his body was filled with some light eating blackness.  It was time... his parents found him that morning in the corner of his room cuddled into a corner, holding something small in his hand, small rivulets of crimson trailed to pool at the floor under him... his head down as he stared off into worlds his parents would never know.  As they called out to him and rushed to his side he looked up... his face was smeared red, deep hateful stains across his bronzed flesh.  His father cried out and grasped his wrist, forcing open his hand as a deep menacing laughter broke from the boy.  He held his tongue clutched in his palm, blood flowing from the fresh tears in the tender pink flesh.  The boy laughed to the skies as his parents faded from consciousness.  He would be on his own... he would free his other half... and his secret would suffer unspoken as long as he lived.<BR>

	When he was 12 he had found some strange books in his room, they were filled with an unusual writing.  Recipes and formulae were meticulously written here, and as the years passed he had learned to read most of it.  They were spells, words of power and recipes for rituals and other brews and tinctures.  The books seemed hundreds of years old and one had an label stamped in them.  From some place in the Americas... Some small Island named Voletta. <BR>

	After his parents passed out he had recalled the address, and made his way to his room packing them up and getting plenty of money to live off of for a while.  Who knows what future his road held for him, but he would meet it head on with his silent vigilance, and he would find the cure for his mind.</FONT></HTML>
