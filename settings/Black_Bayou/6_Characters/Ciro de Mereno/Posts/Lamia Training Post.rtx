Despite the casual demeanor, she looked radiant. Her blistered complexion seemed to glow as the warm light dripped through the skylight. Beside her, at the last round table, a foot of books remained stacked, ready to be read. This was the last step; this was as far as she could take him.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He steps through the doors, right on time.&nbsp; His tall lean form looking around for his mentor, his mistress, and with a nod he sees her near a stack of books.&nbsp; Confidence carries him as he walks over to her, each movement dripping in capability and contemplation.&nbsp; Fingers flash briefly to her. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what is this about?"<BR>
<BR>
</B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For this moment forward, consider me your fate. This is as far as I can take you, the rest is up to you, <I>amante</I>. You will learn. Now." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She tossed one book across the table; it echoed as loud as thunder. The leather bindings held the scripture together as it faced him, the chair directly in front of her.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit."<BR>
<B><I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A smile crossed his lips, devious and rather disturbing, he knew what it was about, but this is their game they play.&nbsp; He pulled out his own large bound manuscript and sat down.&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if I prefer my own study material?" <BR>
</B></I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lamia's, although powerful are still mortal, Ciro. If you prick us, we bleed. If you shoot us, we bleed. After this is over, I want you to read the Merchant in Venice by Shakespeare." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman leans back, kicking up her legs and propping them on the table. She eyes the book in his hand. Oh, how he got more tallies in her book for pleasing her. But, she did not show her approval. She merely continued in her lecture. <BR>
<BR>
"You can study what you please on your time. But for now, you do as I say, and you read what I tell you to." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words were meant to sting, but if their</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=1 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B>relationship was going to work, Ciro was going to have to adapt to her authority, no matter how submissive she was in bed.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've already read the Merchant in Venice. " <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at her smugly and cracked the book she threw at him, then dropped his eyes to it's contents, pulling open his book as well,&nbsp; to use for comparison of course.<BR>
</B></I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She eyes him, a cold and warning glare as her voice rang out to finish the lesson. <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The first chapter gives in great detail the history of the lamia. Read that on your own time. Chapter two deals with the most easiet change--vision. The third paragraph explains the effects the power has on the eyes. A witch can see in the dark, and farther than the typical mortal. Therefore, we have the advantage. <I>Comprende</I>?"<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, that's gone over quite in depth in here, it's because of a semi physical change that occurs when the body becomes a recepticle for the earths mana.&nbsp; The theory in this book I have is that because of the darkness that this stems from, and the spiritual closeness of our abilities having a basis in Qabbalistic teachings, and the Qabbalah being taught to man from Angels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some also taking this farther and saying fallen angels.&nbsp; Am I close?"&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled as his fingers flashed quickly the words and spellings for some that there were no words for in his language.&nbsp; He leaned back and watched her expression, waiting for the irritation to rise in her, almost smug we was.<BR>
</B></I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the hand signals, Dora did not understand.Yet, as she saw his hands fly through the air, she smiled, the lines creasing her lips. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Si... too close for your own good if you ask me, <I>amante</I>. The next chapter..." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfolding her boughs, five digits wrap around the coffee mug, bringing its warmth to greet her nude, fleshy lips. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "speaks of meditation. Although this book in particular gives one way of meditating, there are actually several different ways of meditation. Some sleep. Some make a circle of salt. Some even stand chanting. You must choose which fits you best.&nbsp; Meditating requires a great deal of concentration. Without this, you <I>cannot </I>and <I>will not </I>cast spells. Ever. Yet, since you protect the coven physically, it's not required by me, but I <I>do </I>recommend it. In fact, it comes naturally, so it should not be too difficult for you to learn. The chapter is short since most cannot explain meditation. Some have even compared it to explaining an <I>orgasm</I>. Impossible." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thick lips purse together as the mug is pressed once again to her lips.&nbsp; It is then replaced upon the mahogany, the witch leaning farther back in her chair.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, like the teachnings of the Tantric line of philosophy and magic, the power of magic through sex and the energies released through orgasm.&nbsp; I know much about meditation, there is quite a bit of closeness between the Martial Arts and the usage of magics.&nbsp; I will continue to channel my magics the way the founders of my art did.&nbsp; What's next teacher?"&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another smug smile crosses his lips and he can almost feel her glare at him, trying not to give herself away, she knew he had studied before her, none of this should be a shock to her.<BR>
</B></I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fine. Flip the page. A witch, although mortal, can heal faster--but only if he or she is awake. If one loses consciousness, it will take approximately three days to awaken, and then... the healing rate depends on the will power of the witch. You will learn more of that through experience. I could even give you a demonstration... But not now." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The short strands around her visage are once more swept away, behind her shoulders. He was impressing her, but she dared not show it.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Exactly, the Bruja can force the mana around them to stitch back together any wounds that were created, sort of like the Mana sees them in their most pure and refined state and takes them back to that form that it sees.&nbsp; I take it you're going to explain how the mana can shape us in the forms of our power animals next right? "&nbsp; <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He could just imagine the frustration, all teachers hate a student that already knows the material.<BR>
</B></I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do it, then. Let me see you." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lifts her legs, pulling them from the table before leaning in deep. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Show me."<BR>
<B><I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have not yet opened myself to the change, that the book doesn't explain.&nbsp; That's why you are my teacher."<BR>
<BR>
</B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, I suggest you keep your hands in your pocket before I bite off your fingers.&nbsp; <I>Senor</I>." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She had an awful after-taste in her mouth as she leaned back in her seat again. Her rings flickered with disapproval, flipping two pages in her book, hoping he would follow in the same affinity. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Once you are granted the power, you merely utter the chant and think yourself the animal. Sadly, you cannot choice your form. It is given to you by the Gods. You know very well , Ciro... that we study black magic. And, as a result, most of the creatures given to us are less than beautiful."<BR>
<B><I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and be careful, your irritation is showing.&nbsp; You must understand that this book here has been my life since I was a very young boy, you are not talking to some mere gothic child wanting to be a witch.&nbsp; You are talking to someone with far more than a passing interest, this is no fad to me.&nbsp; Now teach me to channel and accept the change." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His fingers moved with an indignant tone, amazing how someone practiced in the art of this speech can mave intonations and tones with mere fingers. <BR>
</B></I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Telling me what to do are we?" <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The witch picks up another book, all its pages filled with the spells of dark magic. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Read this tonight. Tomorrow, you shall awaken a Lamia, and then, will you discover the ugliness beneath your skin."<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not telling you what to do, you are my teacher, and I expect to be taught.&nbsp; I will read your book, and when I awake the ugliness beneath my skin will be known to all, instead&nbsp; of only myself." <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as he signed to her his face seemed to take on a more catlike feature, his eyes shifting slightly and his pupils stretching into slits.&nbsp; The book was snatched and he stood up from the table. <BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are we done?"<BR>
</B></I><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For now, amante. I'll come to you in the night... and when you awaken.. I'll be sleeping beside you."<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The briefest flash of a smile flashed across his lips as he strode defiantly from the library, theirs was a game of cat and mouse... or cat and bird, sometimes it was hard to tell.&nbsp; Then he left, in the same silence as he entered.<BR>
