Endless Morning:	Dora let her eyes roll to the side, watching Ciro sleep soundly. Burgundy satin lays crinkled between them as she rubs her let against his; it was a simple signal for him to awaken. Ringlets of fused sepia and plaza face the ceiling
Endless Morning:	(oh, for god sake. let=foot)
Endless Morning:	once more. She knew it was time. Glissading from the bed, her nude frame drags the sheet with her, uncovering her spanish lover. The dark red flutters in the air not unlike the man who attracts the bull, covering herself as she
Endless Morning:	heads for the closet. "Ciro... Ciro, amante. Wake.  It's time."
Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	His eyes flutter for a few moments then pry 
Victor A Martel:	open slightly, the thick fog of sleep drifts from 
Victor A Martel:	his mind like fog rolling off of a river.  His 
Victor A Martel:	muscles begin to stir and with a slight strain 
Victor A Martel:	he sits up and looks around for her. "Where 
Victor A Martel:	did you go chicita?  Always in a hurry you 
Victor A Martel:	are."

Endless Morning:	Before the witch took the chance to get clothed, she spins around; the sheet follows her in the same affinity, a whirl of red-letter to burn forever in the mind. "Do not take this so lightly, Ciro," the spanish tongue ripples, "you
Endless Morning:	are to defeat me today... and then you will become one of mine."
Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	His brow raises as he gets up and reaches for 
Victor A Martel:	the boxer briefs laying in the floor, and 
Victor A Martel:	sliding them on he stnds and looks at her.  He 
Victor A Martel:	looks at her with that *look* he gets when 
Victor A Martel:	he's aggravated by her seriousness.  "I have to 
Victor A Martel:	defeat you today, and how are we to do that, 
Victor A Martel:	chess?"
Victor A Martel:	<d>
Endless Morning:	The witch watched his hands fly in the air, words with no sound. One bough of her own lifts in the air, a finger pointed at him suddenly, and then a jolt. Her lips began to part, murmering a song of sort. The topaz amulet began to
Endless Morning:	flicker, her collarbone grasping the jewel like an ivory claw as it protruded and molded her blistered flesh to its configuration.

Endless Morning:	Yet, Dora did not move. Her chest lifts and falls; the rest of her body as still as after the rain. As the sun shines in, lengthy locks of chestnut clutter the satin pillows, staining her face as the strands stick to the soft
Endless Morning:	flesh upon her cheeks. Her dark complexion seemed to absorb the rays, a lenient glow from bare shoulders and feminine feet which stuck out from beneath its covering.
Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	Fingers lift to brush the strands of hair from 
Victor A Martel:	her face and he checks the strike point, seeing 
Victor A Martel:	the redness and applies more balm, not

Victor A Martel:	tucking the sheets under her to protect her

Endless Morning:	The touch of his fingertips sparked consciousness. As her chest lifts and her upper-body props itself up on its elbows, she looks towards him. Her visage seems horrified, prosaic lips dried and beginning to break. Yet, as they part,
Endless Morning:	she leans over him and kisses his, as if a cure for her own. "You did it, Ciro... although something in me tells me it didn't take long..."
Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	He kisses her, the worry about her being badly 
Victor A Martel:	hurt washing from him like water, the effect  
Victor A Martel:	almost visual on him.  He smiles into the kiss 
Victor A Martel:	and twines his hand around hers. "I'm afraid I 
Victor A Martel:	only hit you once my dear.  I'm sorry if I hurt 
Victor A Martel:	you, my instincts kicked in and I reacted to 
Victor A Martel:	your castings." <d>
Endless Morning:	The creases in her face faded with her smile; she was not as amused.  She pulls her hands from his, putting both of them around his neck and pulling herself closer to him. "This is what happens now, Ciro...  You are to be my main
Endless Morning:	protector... I will not have anyone else. Comprende? You are learning well... that I promise you."
Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	Raising a brow to her touching his throat as 
Victor A Martel:	so he shoots his hand in front of her face and

Endless Morning:	Dora, that frown pursing her lips, hesitantly shys away.  "You are to be my first estudiante... We have a special bond no one can break, Ciro. All I ask is you protect me and the coven, to protect yourself. I ask that when the
Endless Morning:	coven is together, you think of me not as your love, but as your mentor. And, I shall give you everything you ask." Pulling away, the witch grasps the sheet both hands, covering her exposed form::
Endless Morning:	<k>
Endless Morning:	(the sheet with both hands)
Victor A Martel:	He knew she would ask this, not that it's much 
Victor A Martel:	of a problem to him.  He smiled softly, as 
Victor A Martel:	softly as he can manage, and lifts one hand to 
Victor A Martel:	touch her cheek while the other flashes his 
Victor A Martel:	words to her. "I will do this, so long as you 
Victor A Martel:	vow to remain loyal to only me in bed."
Victor A Martel:	<d>
Endless Morning:	Teasingly, the mentor sneaks away from his affections. "You ask of me, a mentor of dark magic to be loyal? I am loyal to the coven, Ciro... what you ask of me... it seems you want more of me than I can give." The woman stepped from
Endless Morning:	the large bed, dragging the satin along with her grace. The closet is opened, one bough reaching, groping for her clothes.  Marrón bangs are
Endless Morning:	easily swept to the side of her swarthy visage; an array of hazelnut spectacles saunters over her shoulder to breathe him in.
Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	"Then I'm afriad you may have chosen poorly 
Victor A Martel:	for your first student, or chosen extremely 
Victor A Martel:	poorly for your lover.  I will not share my bed 
Victor A Martel:	or you with anyone and everyone.  You know 
Victor A Martel:	me better than that, you either decide that you 
Victor A Martel:	will share your bed with me alone, or you will 
Victor A Martel:	not share it with me at all."  He stands, no 
Victor A Martel:	look of anger or emotion on his face, as is

Victor A Martel:	muscles tighten and release in some nystical

Endless Morning:	"Don't be a fool." As one limb reaches for the blanco shirt, the other is holding securely to the deep blood-red satin sheet across her bare flesh. For a moment, like a certain curtain, the sheet fell to the wooden floor, the air
Endless Morning:	breaking around it so elegantly and impetuous. The tank top is pulled over her head, coming just below her stomach; sky blue silk lines her lower-torso. Yet, before reaching in for a pair of pants, long legs dart across the room,
Endless Morning:	five digits grabbing a hold of his chin. "Don't be a fool," the spanish voice murmured. "You are my one and only."
Endless Morning:	(defintely was fussing about the spelling of impetuous and forget the ly on it. heheh)
Victor A Martel:	(::chuckles:[]
Victor A Martel:	His eyes meet hers and he stops, glacial spikes 
Victor A Martel:	meeting with her and absorbing her, seeking if 
Victor A Martel:	she's being truthful with him.  He settles that 
Victor A Martel:	she's not lying and cracks the smallest of 
Victor A Martel:	smiles and flashes his hands for her. "I would 
Victor A Martel:	hope so, that's a small price to ask from 
Victor A Martel:	someone that you vow to die for." <d>
Endless Morning:	"Don't vow, Ciro. Do it if you must." Uncolored petals press against his own lips for a few moments before she pulls away, dashing towards the closest once more. A pair of badly worn jeans slide over her hips. "You know, we can
Endless Morning:	never tell anyone of this. Our love is only between you and I. How do you expect me to build a coven if I play favorites? You will have your own room, at least, for show. And, in the night, you may come to me if you so wish."  A

Victor A Martel:	something seems to be missing, something

Endless Morning:	"Por favor." Pulling the long locks of sable from beneath the jacket, she closes the closet and hunts for her shoes. Falling to her knees, she pulls the doc martins from beneath the bed, wisps of hair falling into her perception. "I
Endless Morning:	have to meet someone--someone who will be living with us." Conveniently enough, she leaves out the fact it was a potential witch.
Endless Morning:	<k>

Victor A Martel:	He steps through the doors, right on time.  His 
Victor A Martel:	tall lean form looking around for his mentor, 
Victor A Martel:	his mistress, and with a nod he sees her near a 
Victor A Martel:	stack of books.  Confidence carries him as he 
Victor A Martel:	walks over to her, each movement dripping in 
Victor A Martel:	capability and contemplation.  Fingers flash 
Victor A Martel:	briefly to her "And what is this about?"
Victor A Martel:	<d>
Endless Morning:	"For this moment forward, consider me your fate. This is as far as I can take you, the rest is up to you, amante. You will learn. Now." She tossed one book across the table; it echoed as loud as thunder. The leather bindings held
Endless Morning:	the scripture together as it faced him, the chair directly in front of her. "Sit."
Endless Morning:	<>
Victor A Martel:	A smile crossed his lips, devious and rather 
Victor A Martel:	disturbing, he knew what it was about, but this 
Victor A Martel:	is their game they play.  He pulled out his own 
Victor A Martel:	large bound manuscript and sat down.  "What 
Victor A Martel:	if I prefer my own study material?" 
Victor A Martel:	<d>
Endless Morning:	"Lamia's, although powerful are still mortal, Ciro. If you prick us, we bleed. If you shoot us, we bleed. After this is over, I want you to read the Merchant in Venice by Shakespeare." The woman leans back, kicking up her legs and
Endless Morning:	propping them on the table. She eyes the book in his hand. Oh, how he got more tallies in her book for pleasing her. But, she did not show her approval. She merely continued
Endless Morning:	in her lecture. "You can study what you please on your time. But for now, you do as I say, and you read what I tell you to." The words were meant to sting, but if their

Victor A Martel:	book she threw at him, then dropped his eyes 
Victor A Martel:	to it's contents, pulling open his book as well, 
Victor A Martel:	to use for comparison of course.
Victor A Martel:	<d>
Endless Morning:	She eyes him, a cold and warning glare. "The first chapter gives in great detail the history of the lamia. Read that on your own time. Chapter two deals with the most easiet change--vision. The third paragraph explains the effects
Endless Morning:	the power has on the eyes. A witch can see in the dark, and farther than the typical mortal. Therefore, we have the advantage. Comprende?"
Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	"Right, that's gone over quite in depth in 
Victor A Martel:	here... it's because of a semi physical change 
Victor A Martel:	that occurs when the body becomes a 
Victor A Martel:	recepticle for the earths mana.  The theory in 
Victor A Martel:	this book I have is that because of the 
Victor A Martel:	darkness that this stems from, and the 
Victor A Martel:	spiritual closeness of our abilities having a 
Victor A Martel:	basis in Qabbalistic teachings, and the 
Victor A Martel:	Qabbalah being taught to man from Angels.  
Victor A Martel:	Some also taking this farther and saying 
Victor A Martel:	fallen angels.  Am I close?"  He smiles.
Victor A Martel:	<d>
Endless Morning:	Most of the hand signals, Dora did not understand.Yet, as she saw his hands fly through the air, she smiled, the lines creasing her lips. "Si... too close for your own good if you ask me, amante. The next chapter..." Unfolding
Endless Morning:	her boughs, five digits wrap around the coffee mug, bringing its warmth to greet her nude, fleshy lips. "speaks of meditation. Although this book in particular gives one way
Endless Morning:	of meditating, there are actually several different ways of meditation. Some sleep. Some make a circle of salt. Some even stand chanting. You must choose which fits you best.
Endless Morning:	Meditating requires a great deal of concentration. Without this, you cannot and will not cast spells. Ever. Yet, since you protect the coven physically, it's not required by me,
Endless Morning:	but I do recommend it. In fact, it comes naturally, so it should not be too difficult for you to learn. The chapter is short since most cannot explain meditation. Some have even
Endless Morning:	compared it to explaining an orgasm. Impossible." Thick lips purse together as the mug is pressed once again to her lips.  It is then replaced upon the mahogany, the witch

Victor A Martel:	of philosophy and magic, the power of magic 
Victor A Martel:	through sex and the energies released through 
Victor A Martel:	orgasm.  I know much about meditation, there 
Victor A Martel:	is quite a bit of closeness between the Martial 
Victor A Martel:	Arts and the usage of magics.  I will continue

Victor A Martel:	smug smile crosses his lips.
Victor A Martel:	<d>
Endless Morning:	"Fine. Flip the page. A witch, although mortal, can heal faster--but only if he or she is awake. If one loses consciousness, it will take approximately three days to awaken, and then
Endless Morning:	... the healing rate depends on the will power of the witch. You will learn more of that through experience. I could even give you a demonstration... But not now." The short
Endless Morning:	strands around her visage are once more swept away, behind her shoulders. He was impressing her, but she dared not show it.
Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	"Exactly, the Bruja can force the mana 
Victor A Martel:	around them to stitch back together any 
Victor A Martel:	wounds that were created, sort of like the 
Victor A Martel:	Mana sees them in their most pure and refined 
Victor A Martel:	state and takes them back to that form that it

Victor A Martel:	understand that this book here has been my

Victor A Martel:	practiced in the art of this speech can mave 
Victor A Martel:	intonations and tones with mere fingers. 
Victor A Martel:	<d>
Endless Morning:	"Telling me what to do are we?" The witch picks up another book, all its pages filled with the spells of dark magic. "Read this tonight. Tomorrow, you shall awaken a Lamia, and then, will you discover the ugliness beneath your

Endless Morning:	<k>
Victor A Martel:	"I'm not telling you what to do, you are my
