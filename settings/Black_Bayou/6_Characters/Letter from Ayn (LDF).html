"When buffeted and beaten by life's storm, when bitter cares of life oppressed<BR>
I want no surer haven than your arms, no sweeter heaven than your breast.<BR>
<BR>
When over my life's way there falls the blight, of sunless days and nights of starless skies<BR>
Enough for me the calm and steadfast light, that softly shines within your loving eyes.<BR>
<BR>
The world for me and all the world can hold, is circled by your arms; for me there lies<BR>
Within the lights and shadows of your eyes, the only beauty that is never old"<BR>

Friendship is that beauty...  that friendship which I crave....<BR>
<BR>
I woke up this morning finally understanding every side of the argument. I felt my point was taken and have asked anyone contacting me, regarding the series, to now move forward, to not gossip, or dwell.  It's brilliant work, and I hold no ill or unclean feelings toward anyone. I do not wish to speak too much on this matter as I realize you are somewhere in the middle.  <BR>
<BR>
The reason I am writing is because, for the second time you have been mentioned to me as being flaming mad... at me, at us, at this.  My cheeks have been burning all morning, not with anger but with deep rooted upset; that even the possibility of our friendship being marred by anything as silly as a difference of opinions has me unbearably fretful. I was never made of the tough stuff that can take hate and scorn. I cannot dip into the soil without dirtying my hands, I cannot smile beneath ambush.  <BR>
<BR>
You know me this- my heart is soft, if not fragile, though I would breath a thousand words to prove bravery. I took a stand because it hurt my value not to stand for ethics. I did what I felt was right.  Sweet Rob, would you ask me to cast aside my self assessed morality because my innocence did not understand enough to swallow what hurt me? When I and you and so many others have spooned enough bitter pain in our real lives to make our stomachs churn!? I ran to this game, when my baby was ill... Sept. of 1996.  Two months before he died in my arms.... I hide here hence through everything that has torn me since that moment, pouring my soul into my writing; as if that would save me from drowning. To my surprise, what happened was I made friends who save me every time my heart remembers what I know you know, feels like bone crushing anguish and loss, and loneliness.  In so many years, I sought only to be here in a fantasy haven.  Now, for one moment I state opinion.  I remained civil, I tried very hard not to behave poorly. I have no regrets, save for my last line in the OOC and even in this, is proved that I am human/imperfect. I have been dubbed an angel, by you and many others, but have sworn to you, as I do now, that if I am one.. I am tattered.  I have the deepest feelings of friendship and respect for you and, it literally tears me inside to consider your being enraged by and against me...... <BR>
<BR>
Even more, it hurts inside to know that you my friend... are hurting too......<BR>
<BR>
Your friend for always, <BR>
