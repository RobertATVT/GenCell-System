Once there we will chop the body into small tidbits and soak them in gasoline.  The chopping will take place on a wooden table brought by Victor and he will also bring the Concret and a steel drum.  We will then (after the body is chopped up into chunks no more than 2 inches cubed.  The gasoline and body chunks will be placed in the steel drum and burned until the flesh is reduced to ash.... then the table will be burned as well as all of our clothing in the barrel.  Next step will be to move the barrel into a small boat (That Lexi will bring to the site through one of the many channels of water) and the concrete will be mixed up in the barrel.  Victor and Lexi will take the drum out into the gulf and let the concrete harden while Talon rakes the waters and ground for any remaining bits of body and then takes the remaining gasoline and cover the ground where it all took place setting it ablaze to burn off any more evidence.  Most of this will take place over watery ground so after it is dredged and then burnt the evidence will be washed away and spread through the swamp.  After the bodycrete settles (all personal items mixed in as well) and hardens, a good amount of rubber sealent will be placed around the rim of the drum and it will be capped shut.  Once set up it will be dumped into the gulf to sit at the bottom for a good long time.   Following the return to land we will all get reclothed and go our seperate ways.</HTML>
