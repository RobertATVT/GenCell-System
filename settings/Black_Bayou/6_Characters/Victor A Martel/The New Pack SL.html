3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Victor and his wife Ceile took an extended vacation (one Month) to the farthest reaches of Alaska to spend time learning about how wolves really do things.  While there they spent every moment with a pack of wolves that they gained acceptance with and learned their true ways.  While there they began to pick up the language of the wolves, barks, howls, and certain movements that they use to communicate to each other.  During their time with the pack they became close to them and while Vic was sleeping he had a vision in which the wolves followed him to Voletta... tracking him through the snow covered wastes and down through Canada and the US, until those that survived appeared at his doorstep.  This was something he couldn't have, so he decided that the only thing he could do was to pass the virus to them.  His first target for the creation was the Alpha of the pack who's name was best translated as "Paws with Thunder".  So three night before the full moon he got "thunder paws" to go with him out into the woods alone with him and they did the ritual.  Thunder Paws was frightened at first as Vic built the bonfire and asked him to come to him so he could get a small bit of fur.  But the brave wolf did so, knowing the scent of the furless leg walker as "White Giant" and the ritual commenced.  The next three days were tenuous as Vic waited and led the pack towards an oil drilling station that was about 50 miles from their grounds so the alpha could hunt down one of the furless stink bringers.  Then as it darkened and the moon crested over the horizon Thunder Paws howled in agony and his Grey and white body began to change, and he grew... and he grew... and he became a Horus before the eyes of his pack, and he rushed towards the oil station and slaughtered the guards to a man.  the pack howled a name in the night air before they left him.... they called him Wendigo, the Kin-Eater and left.  When he awoke I was there, in wolf form as always, but the rest of the pack was gone.  We had a long journey ahead of us, and perhaps in time more of the pack would join us, perhaps more of the pack would become Wendigo.  For now, I had to take care of Thunder Paws, there was much teaching ahead of me, and much more learning.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
Vic will create a new pup, but instead of a mortal victim it will be a wolf that will get bit and given the curse of the lycanthrope.  The actual game mechanics for the character will remain the same as any character generated as a werewolf.  the second thing is that the Guardians will be able to learn a new language that they can use to communicate with while in wolf form.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>
