Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unlessthe wounds were created by fire or salt water. Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell. Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body perday and only when the character sleeps. If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain theirpoint (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spelluntil the damage is healed). If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal. The spell takes a fifteen minutesto cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting. Any distractions will force the lamia to start over a gain.

The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal spirit-like quality. They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects. The lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again. While in spirit form, the lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen. Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way. This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell. The lamia isstill affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.The lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly. The lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form. The only thing the lamiais able to do is move, see and think. Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.

By tapping into their pure flow of magick, the lamia will be able to increase all of their abilities. When the lamia taps into their internal magick source it causes changes to them physically; their eyes will shine an unnatural glow while the skin on their body will begin to wither and wrinkle from energy draining from their flesh to power their magick. While this doesn't degrade them physically,it still can appear quite shocking. Anyone with Lore Level 3 has an opportunity to recognize these changes in the lamia (as per the Lore rules). While under this mastery, the lamia gains +2 Soul and +1 Mind for the duration. If thelamia spends an additional Soul point, they can keep this mastery tapped and change scenes without dropping it. This Scene swapping can continue as long as the lamia has Soul to spend.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; <BR></FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#400040 size=3 PTSIZE="11" BACK="#ffffff" FAMILY="SANSSERIF"><B><I>Flight</FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#000000 size=2 PTSIZE="10" BACK="#ffffff" FAMILY="SANSSERIF"></I>&nbsp; - "Potentia fugo de corpus" - 1 / -2 Soul to use.&nbsp; <BR>Room Command: </B>(##Fly##)<BR><B>Generation Cost: </B>15 Points<BR><B>Experience Cost: </B>75 Points<BR><B>Range:</B> Self, Touch<BR><B>Roll System:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 24<BR><B>Duration/Activation:</B> Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR><B>Effect/Description: </B>One of the lamia's greatest abilities is the power over gravity itself, allowing the lamia the gift of flight. There are two separate spells intertwined in this singular one. <BR><BR>Solo flight: This costs 1 Soul and allows the lamia to fly unaided. The lamia can never fly faster than 25 miles an hour and cannot carry anything over ten pounds. <BR><BR>Enchanted Flight: This costs 2 Soul and allows the lamia to transfer the power of flight into an inanimate object - some of the most common being brooms and carpets. The lamia cannot empower any object weighing more than ten pounds. The empowered object will fly where the lamia wishes, though the lamia doesn't have to be in direct contact with the object, they must remain concentrating on it.Conversation is possible, but not even walking will be allowed. This empowered object is capable of carrying passengers, depending on the size of the object -as passenger weight doesn't effect the magic, space does. Common sense prevails here, but if you aren't sure ask the Room Host or ST on how many passengers can fit. The object also doesn't need to be in sight, as the lamia can 'see' from the object itself. If the lamia loses concentration the object will lose the gift of flight and will gently fall to the ground, much like a feather. This has been built into the spell due to past lamia's dying horrible deaths as their objects crashed to the earth. The object will retain some aspects of magic if dropped into water (it will float) or even fire (has protection aslong as the passengers don't leave the object) as there is a small 'bubble' of protection around the passengers. However, passengers can still be effected by blows, shot, stabbed and even hit with arrows. In both versions of the mastery,the protective sphere prohibits items from exiting the bubble (These include but are not limited to physical objects and the effects of masteries) Think -things can go in, but things can't go out.<BR></P>

How about a story that starts farther to the North?&nbsp; North west to be exact, in Oregon country.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There was once a politician running for office promoting good solid Christian values, and to rally the voters will to elect him he had taken a strong stand against his county's rising teenage pregnancy rate.&nbsp; A good cause that any candidate would seek to use in their campaign, especially one promoting the ever popular Christian morals right?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But as is often the fact with politics and politicians he too had a secret he was keeping from the public, his fifteen year old daughter had become part of that rising statistic.&nbsp; Instead of using it as an additional conviction for his standpoint he thought it would be better to keep it a secret.&nbsp; The daughter was kept hidden from the masses and even from members of the extended family.&nbsp; Unfortunately for the candidate his daughter would not agree to abortion and he could not find a doctor whose silence could be bought willing to perform an abortion on an unwilling patient.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However he did know someone willing to take the baby once it was born and a doctor to give it an under the counter adoption complete with a forged certificate of birth for the receiving family.&nbsp; Conveniently the person was one of his supporters, who contributed a hefty amount of money to the campaign effort, to receive the child.&nbsp; So while the daughter grew bigger with child the supporter's sterile wife grew fatter with the aide of pillows and other forms of stuffed clothing.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The wealthy supporter had made a number of enemies on his rise to power, however.&nbsp; Included among them was the power hungry Jonin of a militarist encampment composed mainly of Oriental immigrants and their decedents who had been displaced during World War Two for national security.&nbsp; Since then the group had expanded to include other non-oriental descended people who just generally disliked the current United States government.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I'm drifting away from my story, the night the child was to be "born" to the investor's sterile wife also happened to be the night the angry Jonin moved for retribution for whatever wrongs he felt he'd been dealt.&nbsp; The forgery of a birth certificate found at the scene of the crime by investigators and the wife's cadaver showing no sign of having been pregnant served to help confuse and distract the authorities.&nbsp; With no child to be found in the bloodstained house their attentions focused on the belief that the murders took place because of the illicit baby dealing going on.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What happened to the child?&nbsp; I never told you I was going to tell you a story with a happy ending now did I?&nbsp; The authorities found the body of the doctor at the scene of the multiple homicide, but there was no newborn to be found.<BR>&nbsp;

And in a couple of months it will have been two years since I created this life for myself in Isle Voletta.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two years and no one here knows any better then to think I've been called 'Daren' all my life.&nbsp; No one who's still alive anyway, not even Jade yet knows.&nbsp; Though she knows the most out of anyone left of where I came from and where I was born I still never imparted to her the complete story.&nbsp; Perhaps it is fear of rejection for my faults that I retain my silence, fear that it might get out to others.&nbsp; Everyone has their confidant's, if I had told her would she have confided the secret to someone else?&nbsp; How far would it have spread?<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I keep this silence for fear of loosing everything, this identity has held up even through the background checks of local law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; Perhaps I owe that more to the fact that the Chief of Police at the time I was hired was a good friend of mine and probably didn't look to hard.&nbsp; And then my transfer to the Sheriff's Department after the Police Department closed also probably went through with only a light glance.&nbsp; There might gaps or holes in the identity of Daren Dwoemer, but luckily none have yet discovered them.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I know there are plenty of other people here like me, running from some event in their past, hiding from it, and a small town on an island off the southern coast of Louisiana.&nbsp; How many of them though are running from their entire past, their entire history, from everything they were and thought they were going to be when they were younger.&nbsp; Compared to what the Jonin had intended for me and what the Chunin were preparing me for you might say I switched to the opposite side, and before I even really got started for one.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Little have I found out about my origins beyond what was kept in the Jonin's files.&nbsp; But even if I knew it now I doubt it would have a serious profound effect on who I am, on who I have become.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As bleak and depressing as the present is now the only thing left to do is look forward towards the future, with the magic taught ought to me by Zion as the only steady thing in my life to fill the void.&nbsp; An unfaithful wife leaving it empty once again the magical arts fortify the hole left in my soul by the years I spent filling it with alcohol.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps it is a bit ironic that I summon that strength through the same place where I have the hole.&nbsp; And my eyes, windows to the source show the fire of magic in green flames upon their crystal blue irises turning themselves into the turquoise gaze that often stares out into the Voletta night.<BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am Lamia, and it is time for me to thrive.</FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#000000 size=1 PTSIZE="8" BACK="#ffffff" FAMILY="SANSSERIF"></B><BR>&nbsp;
