<B><I>Since you claim to have purchased only Dispas everything else that increased since you last update that weren't paid for in your XP record (your Soul and Evasion levels) were corrected.  Considering the nature of the changes on your CS included the loss of some levels I can sorta believe a bit of how you explained it happened, the first time.  This time however I'll have to warn you, I will not look lightly upon finding any more unwarrented changes on your CS and will be forced to administer some form of punishment.<BR>
<BR>
Your modifiers have been corrected as well.<BR>
<BR>
Congratulations! Save this approved sheet for your records.<BR>

An icon from 80s television and classic movies, the bartender has become someone we believe in, someone we confide in...well, let's face it, someone we spill our guts to.  And someone we've trusted when they stood in front of us, pouring drinks as we made scandalous deals with dark figures.  What do they know?  What could they bring down on us if they just bothered to find reason?<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description</B>: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Effect/Description: </B> Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration: </B> NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The cunning wolf can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near.  For all intents and purposes, the Werewolf is considered to be totally invisible.  The werewolf will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Werewolves under dispas may not be targeted for attacks.<BR>
