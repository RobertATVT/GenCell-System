Tick, Tock. Tick, Tock. <BR>
Diana laid awake.  It hadn't been long since she had come home.  She thought the shower would have made her restful.  There had been a message on her pager.  The numbers "412666" was all it said.  The significance of those numbers held only meaning to those that were in the circle.  412 was the street number, 666 meant death.  The message was that the Raven had died.  In those six numbers she could gleen that information.  <BR>
<BR>
She had placed a call to Yvonne in LA but her line was busy and continued to be busy.  It was unlike her.  She knew her friend had call waiting and for the line to be busy was unusual, especially for so long.  It was then the worry set in, perhaps Pietro's men had gotten to Yvonne.  There was one in Voletta afterall, she had no doubt they could track her friend down as well.<BR>
<BR>
The news was no suprise.  With the eminent death of Pietro, it stood to reason that the club would be burnt down as well.  Christian had gone to LA just for that purpose.  How many nights had she laid awake in the hotel room staring at the ceiling listening to each noise, her body unwilling to go off of alert.  Tonight was no different despite the earlier events.<BR>
<BR>
She had not danced under the stars since Michael until this night.  Perhaps she wanted to recapture the feeling she had felt that night or something else.  The months of lonliness were wearing thin and James had been the one that had been there.  The dance turned into something more.  Very little was said, hardly anything at all.  It seemed no words were needed.  One reaction led to another and she was still unnerved at what had occurred.  Even when<BR>
they had parted she had fetl awkward yet she surmised that she wouldn't see him again.  <BR>
<BR>
As she laid there staring at the ceiling, she forced herself not to think about what had occurred and focus on something else.  It wasn't that she didn't enjoy what had happened, it was that it unnerved her and she didn't know how to deal with it.  It was something foreign, unexpected and complicated for her to think about.  To close her eyes meant it would come back and she would have to deal with the reality. <BR>
<BR>
She had felt something that was the expression of freedom.  It wasn't a plan, an arrangement or something that she had to do in order to live.  It was just them and there was nothing hidden or secretive to it.  It was rare to her and she knew that with freedom there must come a price.  She had yet to determine what that price was going to be.  <BR>
<BR>
The hours past like the ticking minutes on the red display of the clock next to her bed.  The sun would be up in another half hour and she had yet to sleep.  Had she been a drinker, a drink or two might have calmed her nerves and let her take in an hour or two. Instead the ceiling was what she stared at.  It had 542 marks on it and in the corner was a chip.  If you stared at it long enough a pattern would emerge in the marks that resembled the<BR>
charictures that you would see in clouds on a sunny day while laying in a meadow.  It kept her sane and it kept her awake.  Yet she wanted nothing more than to hear him breathing next to her.<BR>
<BR>
Given the time difference from LA to Voletta, she decided to give Yvonne a call once more.  She tore her gaze from the fixation of the ceiling and rolled over to take her cell phone.  She pressed the speed dial number and this time the other end rang.<BR>
<BR>
"Hello" A man answered.<BR>
<BR>
Odd she thought but maybe Yvonne had gotten a boyfriend. "May I speak to Yvonne please" she responded.<BR>
<BR>
"Who is this?" the man asked.<BR>
<BR>
her heart began to race, something was not right.  She sat up and swung her feet to the carpeted floor. "A friend, is she there?"<BR>
<BR>
"This is Lt. Jackson from the LAPD" he stated letting it hang.<BR>
<BR>
"The LAPD? What's happened?" She gripped the phone tighter in her hand. <BR>
<BR>
"Do you mind telling me who you are?" He was persistent.<BR>
<BR>
"This is Diana Miles, a friend of hers" She began to shake lightly.  What were the cops doing in Yvonne's flat.<BR>
<BR>
"Miss Miles, Yvonne Vermiel was murdered this evening.  Do you have any idea who might have done something like this?" <BR>
<BR>
Diana closed her eyes.  They had found her and gotten to her.  She swallowed back the bitter pain filled pill that stuck in her throat. "No, no..none at all. " <BR>
<BR>
She gave the Lt. her cell phone number and he said they would be contacting her.  She hung up the phone and sat there for the longest time.  If they had gotten to Yvonne, surely she was next.  The price tag for freedom just went up.<BR>
