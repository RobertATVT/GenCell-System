3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Through Financial backing from his Silent partner (Killian Schmidt), Vic has gotten the money needed to continue operation Eclipse Security.  Vic has *paid his dues* to Fairlight and has now managed to purchase new equipment on his own.  This money has come through the support of his clients, through his own means, and his silent partner... The district attourney.  Now Elcipse is an independant entity and free from any ownership by anyone else.  Killian Schmidt has purchased 5% of Eclipse as a *family* interest.  This company will provide personal (Bodyguarding and Security Personnel on site) and automated home or business security.  At the moment the individuals that are employed under Eclipse will have to be re-evaluated, once this is done the will be added to an addendum to this one.  <BR>
<BR>
All contracts with Eclipse will be submitted as SL's should they be businesses or individuals.<BR>
<BR>
Any and all weapons and all weapons and armament will be sent in for approval and clarification as each PC is hired and checked it.  Instructors for all personnel will be hired out of the Shao Tei Tung Dojo.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<U>Class One Guard</U>					Approximately 60% of Employees (75 total)<BR>
<BR>
The backbone of Eclipse.  Standard Security Guards for Eclipse are hired almost exclusively from men and women out of the military.  The training involved in the military gives them a most ample lead into being able to handle the strenuous training and qualifications that Eclipse has for it's employees.  <BR>
<BR>
(Standard Military time served 4 years)<BR>
<BR>
<U>Class Two Guard</U>					Approximately 20% of Employees (25 total)<BR>
<BR>
The second tier of Security, the largest amount of the Quick-Response Intrusion Program teams come from this branch of Eclipse.  These employees have had higher military qualifications and spent more time in specialty training than the others.<BR>
<BR>
(Standard Military time served 6 years)<BR>
<BR>
<U>Class Three Guard</U>					Approximately 10% of Employees (13 total)<BR>
<BR>
The third tier of Eclipse employees consists of Former Military special forces.  These men and women lead the Training of the rest of Eclipse as well as serving as Quick-RIP team leaders.  These people incluse 5 former Navy Seal Lieutenants, 4 Green Beret Seargents, and 4 Army Rangers.<BR>
<BR>
(Standard Military time served 8+ years)<BR>
<BR>
<U>Class Four Guard</U>					Approximately 5% of Employees (12 total)<BR>
<BR>
This level embodies various other factors such as technicians and Bodyguards.  This rank is filled with various backgrounds and needs.  (All in all this is the amount of PC characters hired by Eclipse)<BR>

<B>Security Features Offered<BR>
</B><BR>
1) Physical monitoring by security guards that have been hired, podunk security guards are merely low rank NPC's that are simply there to call the police in case of breakins.<BR>
<BR>
2) Through use of cameras supplied by Fairlights old security branch, which Eclipse look over, we monitor and record all cameras used.  All buildings protected by Eclipse have cameras, which are passed to Eclipses Main office.  The controls for this monitoring is done only at Victor's office and to access this system you must enter ten (10) sixteen (16) digit alpha-numeric passwords only known to Victor.  <BR>
<BR>
3) Standard Security.  Motion sensors, laser sensors, pressure and glass sensors, door sensors and thermal sensors.  The thermal sensors will go off if there is any sudden ten degree difference anywhere in the room.  The video feeds report the feed levels to the systems and monitors so that any attempts to patch feeds from them will register as a decrease in feed.  This works for all security devices.  <BR>
<BR>
4) All features route to Eclipse and the police can be called with the touch of a button reporting the adress direct to dispatch.<BR>
<BR>
5) All Eclipse security is satelite uplinked and may be accessed through the SatLink that is in Victors office at home.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Security Wiring Matrix</B><BR>
	All Eclipse Response personel have the Security Wiring Matrix with retinal and thumbprint activation.  These devices are activated at the beginning of duty and are active until shut down at shift end.  There are 2 Stations where these can be activated and there are only two people that can activate them.  The first one is at Eclipse and can be activated by Victor Martel.   The Second is on Site and an Eclipse Team Leader must be present with an already active Matrix in order to activate any others.  These Wiring Matrix's are part of the <B>Quick</B> <B>R</B>esponse <B>I</B>ntrusion <B>P</B>rogram set up by Eclipse, also known as Quick-RIP.  All buildings protected by Eclipse have had new auto-open doors install so that if there is an intrusion the response team can quickly run down the intruder and aprehend them.  This also alleviates the response team from having to lower any needed weapons.  These Active Wiring Matrix's are detected by the sensors in the door and open when the Matrix enters within 10 feet from the door.  Should one of these Matrix's be active for more than 9 hours they automatically turn off and a locator is activated giving it's location to the Eclipse via a Cellular Communication Chip installed in them.  <BR>
<B>	Properties of the Active Matrix</B><BR>
	Cellular Communications chip with one way response to Eclipse Computers.  The active Matrix is a wiring harness that fits over the shoulders and back of the head of the security officer.  The wiring harness monitors the heartbeat and brainwave activity of the guard wearing it.  Should the guard have critical spikes or low levels this will be reported to Eclipse CPU's and an alert will be given out for backup to assist the guard in trouble.  This signal is given out via the one way communication chip installed into the wiring harness.<BR>
<BR>
	These Matrix's are all GPS individualized and will allow their locations to be overlayed onto a blueprint map of all secured buildings for tactical routing.  Due to motions sensors anyone not badged and in the builing will have their location shown on the grid as well.  These casings are made with a ceramic composite and can endure heat up to 500 degrees without being damaged.  The ceramic keeps the delicate inside electronics inside from being injured before the entire badge itself is destroyed.  This composite also makes the badge difficult to destroy through most acids.  A good hammer, however, will hurt the badges considerably. They only have an effective 2 Body versus blunt trauma dealt to them and an effective 10 Body versus fire or chemical trauma.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Standard Equipment</B><BR>
<BR>
All Eclipse Security personnel get the following equipment.<BR>
<BR>
	Security Wiring Matrix (Only available to Quick-RIP Teams)<BR>

<B>Restriction - Weapons</B>.  All Eclipse PC and NPC guards will have a permit to carry weapons on Eclipse guarded locations while on duty.  However, this does not mean that overtime a PC employee plays between the hours of 6 pm and 2 am in the MR that they will always be on duty.  If there is an abuse of this, then guidelines will need to be set as to how many times per week an employee should actually be on the job.  As of right now, though I will allow both you and your employees to play on an honor system and not have these guidelines placed unless it becomes a problem.<BR>
