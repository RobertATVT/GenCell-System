3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Through the everyday ability to Lease T-1 routing Victor has set up a new standard with all Security setups with Eclipse Secured Sites.  By using the ayncronous data transfer that T-1 acees provides a complex matrix of signal routing has been set up through each and every site that Eclipse maintains contracts with.  This network allows Eclipse Headquarters to monitor team-members and alert medical attention if needed.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
	Eclipse has installed computers at each site to maintain the security procedures and alert routing through the T-1 hub that Eclipse has paid to be ran into Voletta. These computers are not outside accessable by any means, they simply are reduntant systems that monitor what systems are linked to them.  The features of those redundant systems are as follows.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Hardware</B></U><BR>
	Pentium III 800 mhz CPU's with 1024mb memory<BR>
	Wide Area Network cards with redundant data routing handles<BR>
	Video card w/ Video monitoring input<BR>
	Audio card w/ Microphone monitoring input<BR>
	Motion Sensor router card<BR>
	Signal feed monitor (To meausre the incoming and outgoing feed levels)<BR>
	Tamper resistant case with Thumbprint Identification and stun capable 		electrification.<BR>
	Badge signal read radio<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Software</B></U><BR>
	Video feed seperation software:  This software seperates the video feeds and passes them through the WAN (Wide Area Network) where they are collected and recorded at Eclipse HQ for archiving and monitoring.<BR>
	Audio feed seperation software: As above software<BR>
	Motion sensor Triangulation : This takes the distance measured from the motion sensors (done by the time it takes the signal to return to the optical reader) and compiles that data with the other present monitors to give rough coordinates.<BR>
	Signal Feed Monitoring Software:  This software detects any lull in the signal speed or strength through the WAN and if there is  a more than +/- .1% change in that signal an alert is given by that router to Eclipse.<BR>
	Thumbprint Identification Software:  This software detects and identifiers thumbprints of those technicians attempting to work on the routers.  If this print isn't matched or the case is opened without a match an alert is sent to Eclipse and the building goes *hostile* (See below for Hostile procedures).<BR>
	PPRM Software:  This software uses predesigned 3d imaging for each building placed inside (simple map layout, no details) and monitors all badge locations in the site.  This creates the illustrious Power Plant Routing Matrix, which is routed on a constant update to Eclipse Security Headquarters for tactical routing if needed.  This software also monitors the vitals of all Quick-RIP badges within 100' of the building.<BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Hostile Buildings</B></U><BR>
	Anytime there is an alert sounded all security devices immediately go into a *safe* mode, this sets them all active and any cameras not active will immediately begin running feed until the crisis is resolved.  Automated doors withh lock to prevent further intrusion and these doors will only open when a Quick-RIP badge passes within 10 feet of them, this allows for Quick-RIP teams to maintain gun positioning without havign to open doors and can give chase with a relatively unblocked LOS to the intruder.	<BR>

<B><U>Power Plant Routing Matrix</B></U><BR>
	With these monitoring boxes Eclipse has the Power Plant Routing Matrix.  These boxes pick up information from the Quick-RIP badges and will allow the Eclipse Main office to pull up a visual location through 3d rendered mapping technology.  The Matrix will display the locations and relative health (nervousness, pulse rate, neuro levels, etc..) of all Quick-RIP members.  This technology only works within secured sites and within town (The signals can't reach outside of town as the triangulation system doesn't extend far enough.  The poles must be within a certain area in order to get the data and triangulate the position.  This area is defined as no more than 50 feet from any Eclipse protected area.)  Anywhere outside the system the team members can get their location via the GPS systems, however, this doesn't route to Eclipse, this is simply a standard GPS system giving them Longitude/Latitude position and a street/ topographical map overlay.  Only within 50 feet of an Eclipse Secured site can they get the graphical mapping data.<BR>
<BR>
	Use of the PPRM (Power Plant Routing Matrix) maintain feed readings to the Main computer and will inform Eclipse of any potential taps into the lines, as well as containing one shot camera's that film 1 minute of footage that will cover a 150 foot radius around the pole to catch potential breaks into the boxes.  The routers also carry motion sensors and measuring devices that will determine position of persons or targets by crossing pole data and triangulating their position.  These monitors work only on Quick-RIP team members, however.  All of this data and video are sent to the Eclipse Main Computer which only Victor has access too, and can therefore dispense Quick-RIP to the destination with all of the tactical data intact.  This will also give him visuals of most of the outside area of voletta and allow him to watch for crimes and other perpetrations (This video monitoring is only done through the cameras installed on site and in an emergency from the routers when an alarm is activated.  This prevents breach of privacy for the public).  <BR>
	All of the routers have thumbprint locks that only registered Eclipse technicians can open without a warning being sent to Eclipse, these boxes are small and steel (12"x12"x8") and black as night.  The inside of the router boxes are grounded and insulated from the stun matrix that is set up across the sides and outside perimeter of the routers.  Anytime the building goes hostile or a box is tampered with the electricity is arced across the surface dealing stun damage to those in contact.<BR>
