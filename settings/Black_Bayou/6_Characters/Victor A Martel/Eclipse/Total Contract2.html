</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">The purpose of this storyline is to show Player support and activity, thus boosting the effective Income and Finance levels of Eclipse, none of these *ghost* levels are allowed for any purchases other than Maintenence and upgrades for Eclipse itself.  I have listed the Business and Personal clients below, each one offers a different bonus to Eclipse (As per player approval of the Contracts).  The players that are participating still have their levels of the Income and Finance and can use it as normal.  The *ghost* levels of Finance and Income do not bestow any ownership or say in the corporate affairs of Eclipse.<BR>

This includes motion sensors, video cameras and all standard gear.  This contract is for a six month time period which will have to be resubmitted should any change in contract be made prior to then or the limit of this contract is ceased.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Security Features Offered<BR>
</B><BR>
1) Physical monitoring by security guards that have been hired, podunk security guards are merely low rank NPC's that are simply there to call the police in case of breakins.<BR>

2) Through use of cameras supplied by Fairlights old security branch, which Eclipse took over, we monitor and record all cameras used.  All buildings protected by Eclipse have cameras, which are passed to Eclipses Main office.  The controls for this monitoring is done only at Victor's office and to access this system you must enter ten (10) sixteen (16) digit alpha-numeric passwords only known to Victor.  <BR>
<BR>
3) Standard Security.  Motion sensors, laser sensors, pressure and glass sensors, door sensors and thermal sensors.  The thermal sensors will go off if there is any sudden ten degree difference anywhere in the room.  The video feeds report the feed levels to the systems and monitors so that any attempts to patch feeds from them will register as a decrease in feed.  This works for all security devices.  <BR>
<BR>
4) All features route to Eclipse and the police can be called with the touch of a button reporting the adress direct to dispatch.<BR>

2) Through use of cameras supplied by Fairlights old security branch, which Eclipse took over, we monitor and record all cameras used.  All buildings protected by Eclipse have cameras, which are passed to Eclipses Main office.  The controls for this monitoring is done only at Victor's office and to access this system you must enter ten (10) sixteen (16) digit alpha-numeric passwords only known to Victor.  <BR>

3) Standard Security.  Motion sensors, laser sensors, pressure and glass sensors, door sensors and thermal sensors.  The thermal sensors will go off if there is any sudden ten degree difference anywhere in the room.  The video feeds report the feed levels to the systems and monitors so that any attempts to patch feeds from them will register as a decrease in feed.  This works for all security devices.  <BR>
