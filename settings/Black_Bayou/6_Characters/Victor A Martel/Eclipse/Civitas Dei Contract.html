3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>This is a standardized Employment Contract that will allow monitoring of sights and activities as per the Eclipse SL.  This includes motion sensors, video cameras and all standard gear.  This contract is for a six month time period which will have to be resubmitted should any change in contract be made prior to then or the limit of this contract is ceased.  Due to the income that will be generated by this contract I would like a bonus to finance rolls in order to raise income seeing as there is money coming in from clients.  (This part I will leave up to discussion with SL Dept)<BR>

<B>Security Features Offered<BR>
</B><BR>
1) Physical monitoring by security guards that have been hired, podunk security guards are merely low rank NPC's that are simply there to call the police in case of breakins.<BR>
<BR>
2) Through use of cameras supplied by Fairlights old security branch, which Eclipse took over, we monitor and record all cameras used.  All buildings protected by Eclipse have cameras, which are passed to Eclipses Main office and Fairlight Main CPU.  The controls for this monitoring is done only at Victor's office and to access this system you must enter ten (10) sixteen (16) digit alpha-numeric passwords only known to Victor.  <BR>
<BR>
3) Standard Security.  Motion sensors, laser sensors, pressure and glass sensors, door sensors and thermal sensors.  The thermal sensors will go off if there is any sudden ten degree difference anywhere in the room.  The video feeds report the feed levels to the systems and monitors so that any attempts to patch feeds from them will register as a decrease in feed.  This works for all security devices.  <BR>
<BR>
4) All features route to Eclipse and the police can be called with the touch of a button reporting the adress direct to dispatch.<BR>
<BR>
5) All Eclipse security is satelite uplinked and may be accessed through the SatLink that is in Victors office at home.<BR>
