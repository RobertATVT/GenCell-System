These are the radio codes that will be used now during radio communications while on patrol.  They are said instead of the letters. This is used when calling in License Plates.   The correct format for Louisiana License Plates is as follows:<BR>
 <BR>
 NumberNumberNumber hyphen LetterLetter Letter.  i.e: 123-ABC<BR>
 <BR>
 So that would be read, "Louisiana Plates, One Two Three Adam Boy Charlie"<BR>
 <BR>
 You will make one up and say it over the radio if you ask for someone's ID, unless they already claim to have a number made up, which is doubtful.  You -will- use this format.<BR>
 <BR>
 Louisiana Driver License's (called LDL's) are nine numeric digits, right after another. Make this up as well when getting information.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"><BR>
