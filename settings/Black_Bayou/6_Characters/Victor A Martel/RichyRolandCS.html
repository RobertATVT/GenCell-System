Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.&nbsp; This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.&nbsp; If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.&nbsp; The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.&nbsp; The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.&nbsp; Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.&nbsp; Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.&nbsp; They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#000000 size=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="9" BACK="#ffffff"><BR><BR></FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#400040 size=3 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="11" BACK="#ffffff"><B><I>Hypnotic Suggestion</FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#000000 size=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="10" BACK="#ffffff"></B></I> <B>- 2 Soul to use.

They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).&nbsp; The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.&nbsp; In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.&nbsp; Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.&nbsp; If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.&nbsp; The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.&nbsp; No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.&nbsp; If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#800000 size=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="10" BACK="#ffffff"><BR></FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#000000 size=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="9" BACK="#ffffff"><BR></FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#400040 size=3 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="11" BACK="#ffffff"><B><I>Speed of the Cobra</FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#000000 size=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="10" BACK="#ffffff"></B></I> <B>- 1 Soul to use.

Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.&nbsp; The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.&nbsp; The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.&nbsp; A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.&nbsp; They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#ff0000 size=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="10" BACK="#ffffff"><B>Mind Scrye</B> [1 Soul]</FONT><FONT lang=0 style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" face=Arial color=#000000 size=2 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" PTSIZE="10" BACK="#ffffff"><BR><B>Room Command: </B>(##MindScrye ##)<BR><B>Generation Cost:</B> 10<B> </B>Points<B> </B><BR><B>Experience Cost: </B>50 Points<BR><B>Range: </B>LOS<BR><B>Roll System:</B> roll<B> </B>2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will<BR><B>Duration/Activation: </B>Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>Effect/Description: </B>Gives the vampire the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.

The vampire may not add, change or delete these thoughts. It is only a spectator. The vampire may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature. The answers must be as specific as the questions. The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.
