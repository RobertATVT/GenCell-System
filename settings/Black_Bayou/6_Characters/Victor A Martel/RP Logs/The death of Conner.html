DepKarrde: 	::The call had been placed to Victor at 2:30.. Conner was dead.
The sleek black Tahoe 
DepKarrde: 	slowly rolled up to the Dojo and such.  Conner lay dead in the
cargo area wrapped in plastic
DepKarrde: 	so as to not leave blood in the car::
Victor A Martel: 	::Victor made haste to the dojo and is waiting in the
basement getting the incinerator ~
Victor A Martel: 	ready for the bodies disposal.  The cement mixer is on hand
as well as a few bags of quik~
DepKarrde: 	(By and By.. An NPC version of Ann is watching and such <g>)
Victor A Martel: 	krete.  Several Steel drums from the construction on the
dojo are laying about as well::
DepKarrde: 	::He stops the large hulking mass of the truck and shoves it into
reverse, the lights glare
LexMartel: 	::lexi pulls up quietly and parks,his headlight turned out the
last block ~
DepKarrde: 	against the dojo before turned off.  The body is retrieved from
the back of the truck and 
DepKarrde: 	brought inside quickly::
LexMartel: 	or so;and parking he quickly and silently gets off and heads into
the dojo::
LexMartel: 	::looking about as he does so,just in case::
DepKarrde: 	::He carries the body to the basement as instructed:: (m) Sleep
no more.. MacBeth shall 
DepKarrde: 	sleep no more. 
Victor A Martel: 	::waits in the basement... the door is open and waiting for
Talon and Lexi's arrival::
LexMartel: 	::spying Talon he moves to help him and to hold the door for
him::
Victor A Martel: 	::The trail from the rear door to the downstairs covered in
plastic as well to ease cleanup:
DepKarrde: 	::He moves on through the door and figures the body of Conner
won't care if it's tossed down
LexMartel: 	::nods once and waits for him to enter looking about::
DepKarrde: 	the stairs.  So, he does so::
LexMartel: 	::his hands deftly move to remove the helmet,revealing a change
in his appearance~
LexMartel: 	his hair is now snow white::
DepKarrde: 	::Blinks a little at Lexi's hair but, for now, won't ask
questions.  He watches the body 
DepKarrde: 	slump to the floor.  His blue eyes blink for a moment as he gazes
at what was once an 
DepKarrde: 	enemy of the city.. It's people.. And him:: (m) Sleep no more..
LexMartel: 	::looks a bit curiously at the obvious body,the little death
ahving touched him at ~
LexMartel: 	some very deep level::
Victor A Martel: 	:: Once the body settles and finishes sliding down the
plastic covered steps Vic hauls it ~
DepKarrde: 	(s) Hard to believe, eh?
Victor A Martel: 	to the front of the incinerator and looks up at Talon::
>>::T:: Good job<<
LexMartel: 	::nodding to each in turn the doors are closed and secured::
Victor A Martel: 	::Pulls out a few bags and tosses them to Talon and LExi as
they make their way down:: Put ~
Victor A Martel: 	these on before anything is done.
DepKarrde: 	::It had been several months since Roland had told Talon to make
this kill his last.. It 
DepKarrde: 	would, more than likely, be just that.  He puts the bags on I
suppose::
LexMartel: 	::nods as he catches it and puts it on,getting ready for the
grisly work ahead::
Victor A Martel: 	::The bags contain plastic head covers, thick rubber
gloves, face masks and other such ~
Victor A Martel: 	things to prevent any amount of DNA or genetics to get
through any further::
DepKarrde: 	::Okay <g> Doesn't put bags on.. Puts on the equipment in the
bags::
Victor A Martel: 	This is going to take a while so I hope you guys don't have
immediate plans.

Victor A Martel: 	(Okay, what did I miss?)
DepKarrde: 	(nuffin'.. I just need sleep.. ya wanna finish without me?)
LexMartel: 	(Talon asking if we could take it for him)
Victor A Martel: 	(wanna finish it tomorrow?)
LexMartel: 	(sure)
DepKarrde: 	(if ya'd like. Not sure if I'll be on though.)
DepKarrde: 	(Production Week for the play I'm doing.)
Victor A Martel: 	(I will just write an Email to staff about what happened so
that it's official... I will ~
Victor A Martel: 	send it to you guys first for approval though)
DepKarrde: 	(Alrighty.  Thanks m'man
LexMartel: 	(works for me)
DepKarrde: 	(night.. Thanks for the help too..)
Victor A Martel: 	No problem... good to cover our ass.
Victor A Martel: 	You got it amigo

OnlineHost: 	DepKarrde has left the room.
