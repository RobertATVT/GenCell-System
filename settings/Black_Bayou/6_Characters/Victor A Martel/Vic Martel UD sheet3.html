Local Peace Officer
Generation Cost: 35 / Experience Cost: 105
The men and women in blue, justice over all, highly trained and fully equipped to handle every crisis.  Well, almost any crisis. The modern day heroes.  Anyone can be an ex-officer, but only those that get hired by the Sheriffs Department are active officers in-character.

Advantage:   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.

W  Special Abilities  W
Healing - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed)
System/Duration: NA/NA
Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability. Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests. If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over. A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back. Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery. Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps. If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed). The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back. (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the Forum Director.)

Horus Form - 0 Soul to use. (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)
System/Duration: NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift
Effect/Description: Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate. The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders. Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands. Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color. Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct. Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe. Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back. How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is. Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing. While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1). Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions. Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.

Mindspeak - 0 Soul to use. (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)
System/Duration: NA/NA
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind. Mortals are unable to return the thoughts. The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion. Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.

Wolf Form - 0 Soul to use. (##WolfForm##)
System/Duration: NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift
Effect/Description: A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will. They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality. They still retain their normal eye color, however. While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.

(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms). While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body. It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character. Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)

W        Masteries        W
 
Dispas - 1 Soul to use. (##Dispas##)
Generation Cost: 5 / Experience Cost: 25
System/Duration: roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.
Effect/Description: The cunning wolf can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near. For all intents and purposes, the Werewolf is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc. However, even while not visible, the wolf -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others. The werewolf will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey. Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise. Werewolves under dispas cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen. Werewolves also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous. In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone. No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc. If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the werewolf change into Dispas, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the werewolf is, provided the werewolf has not yet left the area.

Enhanced Senses ~ Smell - 1 Soul to use. (##ES:Smell##)
Generation Cost: 5 / Experience Cost: 25
System/Duration: roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.
Effect/Description: A werewolf's sense of smell is so strong and acute, that their sense of smell can sometimes compensate for their sense of sight. Werewolves that utilize their sense of smell can effectively "see" in complete darkness. It can distinguish between the many different scents around him and can pinpoint their exact location. This allows the werewolf to ignore any penalties due to vision. Strong winds or powerful smells can throw the werewolf off. The nuances are up to the room host, ST or GM.

Weight: 265 lbs
Hair Color: White

Physical Description
Victor is 6'-10" tall with a shoulder length white mane and a tribal crest tattoo that goes around his head from widows peak to occipital lobe and bright green eyes. Victor wears mostly Black clothes with high tunnel neck shirts and well made steel toed boots. When in a bar Victor is nice and charming with plenty of good things to say to all, however the callous uncaring look in his cold eyes seems to have softened unless dealing with an enemy to his family.

Wolf Description
Victors wolf form is that of a large Brendel striped White wolf with green eyes. The stripes are a greyish silver color and Victor has his earings large enough that the show when he is in wolf form, his tattoos also show up in his wolf form as black markings on his white skin. Victors Horus form is more lean and lithe than usual and his head has an almost pit-bullish look to it, as does his legs.
