He could have come up with the conclusions he did about the Fortea's, since yes.. alicia did mention needing them in a previous rp he and I had done.  I sent Z a note asking him to get ahold of me if he has any way of getting ahold of the hospital tapes for the night of 11-08-99, where Aton claimed to have gone to see Alicia. Below, I've highlighted the OOC part that I believe Chris got confused with IC knowledge, unless Damian is just saying this to Rora to get Victor in trouble.  The beating up of Ali did occur from Victor, however, that is not something that is known by anyone expect Alicia and Victor. <BR>

Aurora L DuBois: 	::The door opens after a moments pause; the smile ready on<BR>
her lips as she greets<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	him with a murmured hello and gestures him inside:: Come on<BR>
in.<BR>
Damian Knt: 	::He steps inside, adjusting the black trench coat, emerald eyes<BR>
shifting around the room in<BR>
Damian Knt: 	typical-cop style.::What's up, Rora?<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	I just.. need to ask you a few questions, Damian. ::Teeth<BR>
tug softly on her lower lip as the<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	door is shut firmly behind him, then she leads the way into<BR>
the livingroom::<BR>
Damian Knt: 	::He shrugs those broad shoulders.::Alright, what's<BR>
up?::Powerful hands delve into the <BR>
Damian Knt: 	pockets on the outside of his trench coat, the tails of it<BR>
swaying with each step.:<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Sit down, please. ::motioning toward the sofa, she toddles<BR>
over toward her chair,<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	the pad of paper and pencil picked up as she sinks down::<BR>
Damian Knt: 	::He takes a seat, pulling the trench coat around his legs,<BR>
offering the slight view of the <BR>
Damian Knt: 	handle of his 9mm attached to his hip.::<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	::A disturbed look is given toward the gun; her experience<BR>
with them not good.  Tension <BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	shifts through her body, and a deep breath is taken as her<BR>
hand slips down to her side, then<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	appears after a moment::  Do you know Alicia Winter,<BR>
Damian?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	Of course.::He nods that ebony head to her, running his hands<BR>
back and forth across his <BR>
Damian Knt: 	denim-covered legs.::She's missing.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Yeah, she is.  How did you know her? ::seeming like a<BR>
friendly inquiry; her brows<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	pulling together in seeming concern::<BR>
Damian Knt: 	<q> To be honest, she's my packmate.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	(m) I wondered. ::her conversation with Aton now making<BR>
sense::  She's Rya's?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	::He nods slowly, stretching both arms across the back of the<BR>
couch as one leg crosses the <BR>
Damian Knt: 	other's.::She's also a love of mine, as well as one of my best<BR>
friends.  Why do you ask?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	(lover)<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	I'm concerned.. and I've been, looking for her. ::a bit of<BR>
a fidget then::  When did<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	you see her last?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	It's going on two months back.  Christ.  Last time I saw her, I<BR>
was at her house.  She <BR>
Damian Knt: 	wasn't feeling well, so I helped her into the bath and make her<BR>
some coffee.  I asked her if<BR>
Damian Knt: 	she'd be ok because I had patrol to do in awhile.  She said she<BR>
would be and thanked me for <BR>
Damian Knt: 	coming over.  So I left and went on patrol.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Does Alicia take drugs, Damian? ::the dark eyes narrow on<BR>
him; focusing in the not feeling<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	well part as she glances down to the pad of paper::<BR>
Damian Knt: 	::An ebony brow quirks and a bit of anger at the thought that<BR>
she would even mention it <BR>
Damian Knt: 	fills his eyes, but he relaxes.::<q> No.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Who are the Fortea's/<BR>
Damian Knt: 	A family of vampires.  Why?<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Do you like them?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	That's a pretty broad question, but in general, I'd have to say<BR>
no.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Did Alicia?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	Although recently, I've been getting along with Jade.::Nods<BR>
slowly before answering her <BR>
Damian Knt: 	question.::Yes, she did.  But there are underlying reasons for<BR>
that.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Why would Alicia... 'need' a Fortea?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	Hmph.::He snorts before looking up to Rora.::She was a Fortea<BR>
ghoul.  Apparently something <BR>
Damian Knt: 	about her parents being ghouls and thus she was born one.  She's<BR>
been kind of addicted to <BR>
Damian Knt: 	the stuff for a long time.  I tried to help her get over the<BR>
addiction by taking her to <BR>
Damian Knt: 	Mexico for a couple weeks.  And when she came back, she got<BR>
right back on it.  I believe <BR>
Damian Knt: 	that's why she was sick when I last saw her, but I can't be<BR>
sure.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	So you didn't like this addiction. ::confusion is clear in<BR>
her expression<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	as she tries to make out what he's just told her::<BR>
Damian Knt: 	Who would?  I don't like possible spies in my pack.  But I<BR>
wouldn't -kill- her over that. <BR>
Damian Knt: 	I don't kill packmates...unless it's on Rya's orders.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	You think she's dead then?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	To be quite honest, I gave up hope awhile back.  In my job,<BR>
after a week, if the person <BR>
Damian Knt: 	doesn't return, there's not much hope.::He sighs and glances<BR>
down at the floor, obvious <BR>
Damian Knt: 	emotion behind his voice as he holds back the tears.::<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	In your job, perhaps.  Is that the attitude of your pack as<BR>
well? ::some underlying tension<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	laces the question before she shakes her head:: I'm sorry..<BR>
Look, why wasn't there<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	a search for her?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	I searched a bit for her.  But with no clues and no leads, it<BR>
was hunting for a needle in <BR>
Damian Knt: 	a haystack.::He looks up at the ceiling, his eyes watering ever<BR>
so slightly, but not yet <BR>
Damian Knt: 	crying.::<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Can you name names.. or tell me who else Alicia was close<BR>
to? Males..perferably. Maybe<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	lovers.<BR>
Damian Knt: 	Hmmmm...Vic Martel</FONT><FONT  BACK="#ffff00" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> I know once beat the crap outta her...</FONT><FONT  BACK="#FFFFFF" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Havoc<BR>
Fortea...Gian Fortea...those <BR>
Damian Knt: 	are the three lovers I knew about.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Two Fortea's?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	Let's just say, she liked to taste different blood types.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  BACK="#ffff00" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Aurora L DuBois: 	::a moments thought:: Why did she get beat up?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	No idea.::He shrugs those broad shoulders, leaning back into the<BR>
couch.::She just <BR>
Damian Knt: 	off-handedly mentioned it at one time.  I was gonna go pound the<BR>
shit outta Vic, but she <BR>
Damian Knt: 	asked me not to, so I didn't.</FONT><FONT  BACK="#FFFFFF" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Vic is the some Martel that owns Eclipse security, right?<BR>
Damian Knt: 	Yeah.  Be careful though, he's a wolf too.  Apparently he leads<BR>
his own pack, so he might be<BR>
Damian Knt: 	an Alpha.<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	::a nod:: And Gian and Havoc.. they're.. vampires? ::having<BR>
heard of such, but always<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	dismissing it as insanity::<BR>
Damian Knt: 	Yup.::Nods in comfirmation.::<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Ok. ::her hand slides down, and she nods; relaxing back<BR>
into the chair:: I think that's all<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	I wanted to ask.<BR>
Damian Knt: 	::He rises from his seat and holds out his arms to get a hug<BR>
from Rora.::<q> If you hear <BR>
Damian Knt: 	anything, let me know?<BR>
Aurora L DuBois: 	Alright. ::she studies his face before standing slowly and<BR>
walking into the<BR>
