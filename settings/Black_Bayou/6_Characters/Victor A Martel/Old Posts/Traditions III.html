	Victor and Marie walked through the compound, there lazy morning steps carrying them deep into it's heart.  Victor had thought this place to have been an old resort taken back by nature but he wasn't sure now.  As the two of them reached the heart of the place he saw the reason for his doubt's.  His eyes wandered over a beautiful and interesting wonder, this place was like some enchanted wood out of some fable.  Sitting on the ground was a large low stone table, it's surface was weathered and beaten with age, and it's surface was covered in small glyphs.  Surrounding the table was one of the strangest sights of all, six trees grew there, all evenly spaced apart and almost identical in size and shape.  What was the most interesting thing about them is how the branches had been woven and grafted with one another to form this canopy above the table, sheltering it from rain and as much weather as it could.  This is where he was led.<BR>
	Victor sat across from Marie, his place on the cold ground taken stoicly as he leanded against one of the trees for support.  He could feel her eyes digging through him as he sat there, but he kept looking at the other inhabitants, the packs.  They were varied and unique, some wore the archaic clothing that he was given, while others wore clothing dating through random times through the past.  This group was certainly confusing, Victors mind reeled trying to come to some reason for the varied dress, but all he could come up with was the clothing represented their creation.  If that was the case it looked like he might actually live a very long life indeed.  <BR>
	"I've been trying to figure you out Victor, but you've escaped me.  The day you were brought into the camp I noticed a defiance about you.  I wat to help you Victor, but you've got to be willing to let me.  Let's just talk a bit, tell me about your family."  Her voice broke the silent chilled air around them like silver chimes and crystal, and it took every bit of will that Victor could dredge forth not to just spin and commence to babbling.  With a deep breath he drug his eyes from the packs going about their daily business and turned towards her, his eyes fixed on hers for a while before he actually spoke.  Certainly she had some power of the wolf to make him feel this way towards her, but with a crack of his neck he drove the thoughts as far away as he could manage.<BR>
	"Let's see, where should I start.  I have three beautiful children, Jordan and Ashley are twins, they carry the blood of the Martels in them, I can see it when they play together.  Ashleys the stronger one though, he's keen and precise, she'll make a good Alpha some day.  Jordan's more of the contemplative, he sits back and watches Ashley, and the rest of us.  He'll become a great teacher I'm sure.  The third is my baby boy..  Little Vic, he's my man...  he's the underdog of the siblings, he's younger and doesn't have a trace of the wolf anywhere in him.  His mother wasn't one of our kind, but I love him no less.  He's the one shot by hunters, and if not for the grace of God and his Angels he would be dead now."  <BR>
	He looked past Marie for a moment, thinking back to that night in the hospital, the night the three fates brought him back his son.  They stood there bathed in light, and one of them even had wings that shone with a golden light that was just the most warm and comforting thing he had ever felt pass acros his hard hateful skin.  His son was forever changed that day, as was he, something unlocked in him and he broke in resolve.  Once he hated everything holy for taking away his Suzette.  He didn't any longer, he had been given back someone else just as important to him... funny that it takes a miracle to make some see the truth.  He felt the tears slipping down his cheek again as his mind visioned his sons first natural breath after the injuriy, he looked back to Marie feeling a little embarrassed and saw that she too had tears running down her cheeks.<BR>
	"Why are you crying?" Victors voice was a bit rough and broken., but it was asked with honesty, free of his usual sarcasm.<BR>
	"I've felt that light before, and t always brings tears to my eyes." She smiled after saying that, and reached out for his hand.<BR>
	"What?" He looked at her hand with a bit of curiousity and mistrust.<BR>
	"I want to show you something Victor, just take my hand I won't hurt you" She smiled and opened her hand more, it looked so small and fragile in comaprison to his as he reached out and grasped it.  </B><BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>At first there was nothing, but then slowly the rest of the camp faded into blackness, the image slowly being replaced by a dirty mud coated field.  Victor looked around and saw bodies strewn here and there and that most of the modd was mixed through with blood.  He walked across the field and look at the hacked and mangled bodies dressed in mail and leathers.  <BR>
	The broken banners lay across the field, the smell of rotted flesh and gore assaulted his nostrils as he stepped around the carnage.  Finally he saw a woman lying on the ground, her hair was soaked in blood and she had a horrid rend across her chest... Victor kneeled nex to her as she gasped for air, frightened and startled eyes looked past him, almost pleeding for help.  He knew before he recognized her face that he was looking at Marie, it was some other time but it was clearly her.  He reached down to run his fingers through her hair, to try and sooth her as she passed away but his hand could reach her.  He growled low at being unable to assist her and looked around for someone that might be able to, but all that was around was death.  He stood and howled in silent rage, unable to make his fury audible in this strange realm.  <BR>
	His heart jumped and he nearly began the change as a figure appeared in his vision, the tall lean man walking through the bodies cresting the hill that Victor stood upon.  His face was serene, if not sad and forlorn, he looked around the field as tears flowed freely from his eyes as he approached.  The figure approached Victor and Marie, not even noticing Victors presence as he knelt beside marie and gathered the white robes around his body.<BR>
	The strange mans hands gently brushed her hair aside, similar to the manner which Victor had wanted to.  As he did his other hand lifted to hover over the wound across her chest.<BR>
	The mans hands began to shine with a yellowish light, almost like gold spun into energy, and miraculously Victor watched as her wounds began to heal.  Her eyes gained a clarity and focused on the man, confusion taking over her expression as he lungs filled with much needed air.  With a heavy sigh the stranger stood and began to stagger away from her as she clutched her shit together and scrambled weakly to stand.  As Victor watched the scene, the strange man began to fade into nothing, completely gone after no more than ten steps.  As his vision of the camp returned the last things he heard were the prayers of Marie chiming over the field of battle.<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>His vision cleared and he was still looking into the deep blue eyes of Marie, so glassy and tear filled they were.  It almost wounded Victor to see her crying, if those had not been tears of happiness that she let loose.  He smiled and squeezed her hand gently, this would certainly be the most interesting lessons he's ever had before.</B></I></HTML>
