	The flight to Kosovo was tiring at best, the service was decent but the food left less to be desired than Malcom McVey naked.  Alexi was quiet for the entire trip, not a word from him, he just sat there staring out the windows.  Sometimes I wish i could pick up the random thoughts from another persons mind, I wish I knew what he was thinking other than revenge.  I know that when we get there the rage will build inside him, I just hope that he can<BR>
keep his control.  I have taught him as well as I could for the past few months, he has turned into quite a wolf.  I am proud of him and would gladly die by his side if need be.  Finally the plane ride is over and we meet our UN pick up at the airport, a short drivve and we are at the US Embassy where Alexi will have to fill out paperwork releasing his family records to US Officials so that it can be looked into...  But we have other plans. <BR>
<BR>
	With all the boring paperwork done and all the sentiment an uncaring military stuffed shirt could toss your way overwith, we finally get a good nights rest.  The hotel we stayed in was provided by the UN and was no five star establishmen, but the beds were nice and comfy.  We had to be up real early, the UN guys would pick us up at 10am, but we had a meeting before that to attend.  Six O'Clock came aweul early, and the sky was a dismal greyish tone<BR>
that looked altogether unhappy and foreboding.  Like good troops however we got up and dressed and walked to the small park a few hundred feet from the hotel, making sure that we were not being "observed" of course.  That is were we would meet with Captain Uri Tankgarin our KLA contact to discuss the small matter of assistance.  <BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"You asked to meet with me?"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <BR>
	The Captain said with a very dry slavic voice, very ominous and commanding.  He was no small man, his arms were well sized and his chest was like he had a suit of Armor under his shirt.  Even I was a bit worried about ticking him off.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"Yes sir, I will not take up any more of your time than I have to so I will get straight to the point.  We need your help.  My friend here was born and raised in these parts and his family was murdered.  They were victims of the ethnic cleansing, and well...  as you can imagine we wish to see those responsible meet the justice hey deserve."</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <BR>
	I took a deep breath after hammering out that little spiel and sat back to watch his reaction.  I waited, and waited, but not a single trace of emotion, reaction, nothing crossed his face.  This man had the most blank and unerring face I had ever seen.  Then as suddenly as the news came to Alexi, he spoke.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"What do you wish of us?  We have the UN breathind down our necks to disband and let them handle things.  By months end we must hand over to them sixty percet of what armament we have.  And do you even have an idea of who killed his family?"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  <BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"No sir, we have no idea.  W were hoping that your Intel could assist us, we ae willing to do anything you want.  All we want is retribution.  Anything."</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  <BR>
	That was the last ditch begging plea that I could think of...  I hope he understood honor and our right to vengance.  That was all I had to bargain with.  <BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"Anything you say?  If I were to tell you to kill that man over there...  the one sweeping the street, would you?"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  <BR>
	His brow raised questioningly as his cold vlue eyes bored into me.  I stood and turned to walk over to the man when I saw a flash of movement and his steely grip was on my shoulder moving me to sit back down on the bench.  I looked to Alexi to calm and that it was alright, I could feel the anger from him at this point, and knew he was about to spring.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"I said anything didn't I?  I keep to my word."</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <BR>
	At this point nothing could go wrong, it was a warriors pride, to men facing off testing each others limits, I would have killed that man had he not stopped me.  Nothing was going to stop me from handing Alexi his justice and revenge.  I left everything behind me, even the woman I love.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"Very well, we have a use for you.  How many of you are there?  And do they have your fire and honor?"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"There will be at least five of us.  Three have military background, the other two have their own unique abilities.  We can perform severl covert tasks and are all skilled in hand to hand combat.  At least two of us are marksmans and one s trained in demolitions.  And as far as Honor and Fire?  They will do as I ask without question, and they will follow my lead."</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"Good, we will set you up with a small HQ that we used, some armament, supplies that you will need, mainly keep you well supplied.  I will also begin looking into what forces where around his families location when they were killed.  Sound fair to you?"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"And in return for all of this, what are we expected to do?"<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	"There are certain units and locations that were on our agenda to hit, that we had not done so in time.  We can no longer cause small skirmishes and must act under official UN guidelines.  You on the other hand do not have to.  You will do what we could not.  You will continue to aggitate the Serbian military "Unofficially", hus giving us the chance to strike back "Officially".  We have no<BR>
desire to leave here, many of our families were killed as your friends were.  We seek the same goal as you, but there are certain rules that we must follow.  You on the other hand, do not.  So you attack what we tell you to attack, and we will find the killers. Deal?"<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	"Deal"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
	My heart raced as I shook his hand sealing the agreement.  But we would have to pack before the meeting with the UN for Alexi to identify his families remains.  We bid each other fair well and shook hands.  And before we knew it we were at the UN and the Official BSing began.  Alexi was taken into a seperate area where his family was kept.  The condition that they would be in would be horrific, and I worried about his contro once more...  and as<BR>
time wore on I waited.<BR>

	After the bodies were identified we were to fly back to the US.  This was a UN safebuard to prevent vigillante's like us from lashing out and getting ourselves killed.  Good thing for us the driver that was to return us to the airport and see us on the plane was a KLA sympathiser.  Instead of going to the airport we went straight to a KLA encampment where we were given the location of our first hit.  A small Serbian vehicle yard with two UN Hummers<BR>
that were taken in a conflict.  We were to get in and steal these vehicles for our own use.  In the mean time we were given two Dirtbikes that had been modified to reduce the noise level to 25% the original levels.  Not bad so far.  I had a few calls to make and the Captain was gracious enough to let me use their Satellite hookup.  So here went nothing.<BR>
