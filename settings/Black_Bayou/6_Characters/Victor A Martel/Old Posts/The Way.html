	I recieved a phone call today, rather out of the blue.  It was from Susan Lucesco, Maria's mother.  Seems that after her husbands appearance and the obvious perk in her childs temperment, she took Maria to a psychiatrist to see what the sudden change was.  Nothing new for Maria, for the last few years she's been in and out of doctors offices to discover why she seemed to be withdrawn and in a depression.  Well this time she told the doctor that her Daddy was taken away by an Angel for hurting her.  This led to more talks and it turns out that Mr. Lucesco had been molesting his daughter.  No big surprise for some of us, is it?<BR>
<BR>
	Back to the phonecall though...  Miss Lucesco called to have an top grade security system installed in her home, her husband has been abusing their daughter and then ran off in the middle of the night.  She has no intention of him ever entering their home again, and she's worried of her daughters safety.  Funny how things work.  This time though I will take a spectator with me, someone to see the other side of what it is I do.  Someone who doesn't quite understand that my "crusade" a,s it has been put, isn't just the work of a raving beast out for blood.  There is a positive outcome to it all, a young girl with a new lease on life.  <BR>
<BR>
	With a few quick movements the speakerphone is dialed and the ringy ding of her office line sounds through my own, a few short moments...<BR>
<BR>
	"Ceile Malley, How can I help you?"  Her voice filled my office, still a joy to hear even though we have been through some very rough times as of late.  There is an almost physical tension between us now.  The silence in the loft is always uncomfortable, and it's becoming more and more like we are drifting apart...  I just want her to understand.  She doesn't have to help, she doesn't have to participate...  Hell she doesn't even have to support, all I want is for her not to hate me for what I feel is the right thing.  More than anything I don't want to have to choose, the outcome of that would be disastrous.<BR>
<BR>
	"Hello, hon....  could you meet me for lunch?  I have someplace special to take you."  I put as much soothing entusiasm into my voice as ossible, not too difficult sine I am rather worked up over this.  Surely, if there is any way to get her to understand, Maria is that way. </I></HTML>
