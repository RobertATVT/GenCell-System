</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="News Gothic MT" LANG="0">     Once again my head rests on the pillow and my eyes close into a long needed slumber.  This time it takes the jet stream of memories longer to begin, but there they are coming at me with the ferocity of a hurricane.  The broken shards of my life float around me like debri caught in a great storm, while I float around like in a pool of thick black ink.  Like always I try to wake myself from<BR>
this horible nightmare, but to no avail.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>     I sit and wait for her to show up, "she's usually not late" I think to myself sitting in my families garden maze.  I can hear the small pitter patter of a childs feet, and I can smell her flowery scent getting ever stronger.  I wait as if I have no idea that she is approaching, she likes to surprise me.  The quick footfalls slow into a creep, and I can smell her strongly, she has a wonderous flowery smell, like she rolls in a flower bed before I see her.  She sneaks up behind me and when she is right at my back, she grabs my sides with a tremedous "BOO!!!".  I play jump a little and act shocked, again.  "Suzette you little meany!  You got me again!".  With that she bursts into a lilting silvery laughter that sounds more like bells ringing than sounds made by such a cute little girl.  Her laughter and happiness have always lifted my spirits, they<BR>
have always made me enjoy life.  Not the knowledge that I will inherit my families business, not where I live, just her.  She gives my life a reason and a purpose.  If I could only convince Papa to let us marry.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
     Why do those memories have to come back to me?  Why do I have to be tortured by the memories of her!  I just want to remember the good times we had in passing, not to be slapped coldly by the memories every night!  The thoughts are slowly driving me mad, I can feel the clouds of insanity closing in over my mind.  The madness just flows ever so slowly, gaining with every memory that I have to endure.  Why can't I wake up?<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>     Another small town reveals itself as I walk over the rise.  This one isn't too small, not like the last one which didn't even have a pub.  This one should, the streets are even cobbled here, a big step up from the last village.  I walk into town knowing only enough Romanian to get a job and do what I do best...  Make drinks.  I find the Pub pretty easily and walk inside, I get odd looks from the locals, but I'm used to that.  These small towns are peculiar in the fact that they have a clan like feel to them, like they are part of a single family and have been so since the dawn of time.  I walk up to the owner and ask if I can work for him for a while and he agrees...  This is the selfsame town that I meet Alexi in.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
     Well that was interesting to say the least.  This is the first time I have had a dream that had anything to do with Alexi, I wonder why?  Alexi is my closest friend, my only traveling companion...  I guess most would refer to him as a sidekick, but I don't think so.  Funny, I never expected him to end up travelling the world with me, he seemed far too stuck in tradition and his family for that, but one never can tell.<BR>
<BR>
     Another mind numbing flash of light...  The darkness hits me and my eyes settle to it.  The headlights are really unexpected, who would be coming out here at this hour?  I begin to run for the woods edge when I hear several loud bursts of gunfire and feel a terrible pain in my back.  I keep running, these wounds won't kill me, my body repairs damage far too quickly for that.  I can smell them following me, I can smell their fear, I can hear them<BR>
walking.  I rush off and dart in a different direction, spinning around and coming from behind them.  I leap out at the one in the rear and pull my claws down his back, tearing deep and seperating ribs from his spinal column, he won't live to hit the ground.  The next one spins around and fires point blank into my chest, the shot tears at my chest and my breathing becomes ragged.  In one last effort I swing at him and rip across his chest, then I<BR>
fall to the ground passing out as my body tries to repair itself again.<BR>
<BR>
     What was that?  It must be me running from Suzettes home after I slaughtered them to a man, woman, and child?  I can't understand what is going on?  How I could have these memories of being a werewolf and not being one myself, I want to become one and have talked to Skye about it, but it hasn't come through yet.  And it's looking like I'm not meant to be.  Skye, I am so confused about her as well.  She reminds me of my dear Suzette all grown up.<BR>
 Her pretty blonde hair in ringlets like Suzette, her ocean blue eyes, and her soft lips.  I wonder at times when she laughs, just like her, if maybe Suzette didn't die but was somehow moved to the US, and I have finally found her again.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
     Skye sits next to me listening to my terrible past as I weep over her death.  She is such a comfort to me, I would have never guessed that we would become friends.  She was so stand offish earlier in the Dojo when she practically swallowed a plate of oriental noodles, even with her swollen and broken jaw.  She is still beautiful even with her bruised jaw, she reminds me so much of her.  I can hardly stand to be near her, the feelings run deep in<BR>
me.  She listen to me babble on about how much I miss her, and want to find her some day, and to make sure that she is never hurt again.  I want to protect her and take her wounds, to filter out the pain that she feels.  We talk about how I must get over Suzette, how she is never coming back, and how I couldn't have saved her.  Then she shows me the most wonderous thing I have seen in my life, and it almost pulls at a part of me inside.  She walked<BR>
away from me and turned her back to me, and slowly with a moan she turned into a wolf before my eyes!  I was amazed, that she is so unique and caring at the same time.  She is even a remarkable wolf, eyes of sea blue staring at me, tongue lolling about, fur glistening in the moonlight.  I get into squat, sitting on the balls of my feet and holding my hand outstretched to her.  She trots over to me and sniffs my hand then begins to lick it, I'm not<BR>
sure what to do now, should I pet her?  This is Skye I think, would petting Skye be polite?  I lightly scratch behind her ears anyway and she seems to not mind, almost enjoying it.  Then all of a sudden she trots away to where she changed the first time and begins changing again.  As much as I want to watch, she is getting naked and I can't bring myself to defile our friendship.  I turn my back and cover my eyes, sitting there trying not to look at<BR>
her.  I didn't even here her come up to me, which was odd due to my great senses.  She chuckles right behind me making me jump with a start.  "you aren't like the other guys after all, they would have watched to get a free peek of a naked girl" she says.  I look up to see her smiling face beaming at me, I feel so warm inside now.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
     Why am I thinking of her so much recently?  I am planning on marrying Melanie soon, even though I'm not too sure about it.  Isn't it too early for marriage?  Why am I jumping into this all of a sudden?  What am I running from by trying to prove to myself how much I love Melanie?  I'm so confused, the memories seem to hit in no order, yet they make out a scene for me to follow.  Maybe through the maddness I will find the answers to unlock my<BR>
sanity?  That is an odd concept isn't it, but as they say, what doesn't kill me will only make me stronger.  I need strength, I can see storms brewing on the horizon and nothing will be any easier.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0080ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
    A dark smile peers through a window, my window.  I can see myself lying asleep in bed, the covers pulled up to my chest and a content smile on my face.  You will assuredly lose that content smile before long, child.  I reach my arm into the window and set the small silver locket onto the nightstand.  I concentrate on the boys mind, letting the scenes flow from me and into him, the murders, the desicrations, all of my hatred.  Then I am gone,<BR>
running through the night like a natural predator.  All I can think of is how the boy will be forever changed, I have creaated my son, the next monster to roam the country and kill.  I have won again, even if they manage to kill me, my son will continue in my stead...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
     I shoot awake with a start, tears streaming down my cheek.  "NO!" I scream, not knowing where I am or who I am, the wall of confusion settled totaly over my mind, clouding everything that I am, or was.  The person that I was is lost, the person that loved.  I feel a rage settle into my chest, but there is a small spark fighting the hatred.  It's driving me further over the edge!  Why me?  Why?<BR>
