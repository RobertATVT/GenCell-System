All things in nature have pattern and reason.  All things exist by some divine hand.  I am sitting here because I am in pain, and watching the rythm of life, the waters edge, sooths me.  What made me decide to play God?  I have found all the happiness I could ever want in her, my Kimberly.  I have seen the face of love stare at me continuously, without judgement or regret.  Why can I not be happy with this alone?  Why must I insist on sharing my curse with her?  I tried to play God last night...  I tried to spread my disease to an innocent young man, and in turn I killed.<BR>
<BR>
<I>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11>The ritual went on for six hours, the fire lapping at the night air, the sound of my voice thrumming around me.  This was the first time I had done it...  a test so to speak.  Mike had no idea what was to happen, but I had chosen him for creation.  I had chosen him as the trial test subject for the rest of my pack.  He was the mad scientists guinea pig, the poor lost soul caged and bound to the doctors whims.  When the ritual had been done, the prayers said, the blessings asked and the state of mind reachedI glared at him, my eyes gleaming from the fire, burning like an animal.<BR>
	"Run Mike, run for your life...."  I said to him with a voice half a growl have a spit curse.  He had no idea what fate I had chosen for him.  But he ran, slow at first, till the howling began and he ran for his worth...  he had to dodge the young trees though.  I burst through the forest in the Man beast form, my legs like hydrolic pumps beating at the ground.  I became a machine of rage, my eyes seeing the red at the edges, the moon too recently full.  I howled into the night victoriously when his scent became overwhelming, he had stopped to catch his breath.  The shattering of the young trees broke into the night air like I had broken mother earths ribs, and he started off too late.<BR>
	"Oh God please, stop...  please...  don't....  ahhhhh...." were the last words that Mike Storm would utter in this world.  I had lept upon him and driin my claws into his back and clamped my Unnaturally strong jaws onto his shoulder and neck...  The moons rage overtook me.  My will was weak and my hatred driving me on to do things unspeakable....  Now all that remains of Mike are some clothes thrpwn into the ocean and some red ooze washed away by the drizzling season.  I tried to play God.<BR>

Is it because I fear that like Suzette I am too weak to protect her?  Yes.  Is it over powering love that drives me to chase her down in the woods like an animals next meal?  Is that fear worth the risk of me killing her like I did Mike?  How can I create a pack, a family, if all I do is kill?  If anger is at the seat of my soul?  I pray to God that the anger leaves me, the loss and agony that I still feel.  But I will carry on, I will go on to make a pack that is unlike the one before.  A pack that is a family.  No more the Broken Hand that I was in, the seperate and working fingers of a hand that was shattered and in disrepair.  Syn tried, I don't blame her... we let her down as much as each other.  My kind was meant to travel, hunt, and live in packs.  To act like a family unit of predators...  I watch Discovery films on Wolf behavior over and over.  I see the specials, and wonder what we are missing.  <BR>
<BR>
	Every night I watch her sleep, every morning as she sits there adoring me when I get ready to teach downstairs, I wonder why.  Why would she become so in love with me?  Granted I am tall, in good physical shape, and foreign...  but I am also moody, angry, and I carry a lot of excess baggage.  I will never understand her, we fought the other night because an old lover was threatening to kill her.  I went to resolve the issue and she was upset because I wasn't paying attention to her.  Instead of sitting there cooing over her I was bartering for her life and trying to keep peace instead of allowing a full war to commence ith her as the first casualty.  But she just doesn't understand.   I know Laja was bored, I know I antagonized her further, but still...  a war over a petty bad joke?  I see that things have not changed in Voletta, my armor feels tarnished in This place, my shield has a constant shadow over it, and my sword is dull.  But I will stab at the darkness that sits here, the foul undercurrent of deceit and hatred.  I will strive to cleanse this blight before my family gets taken into it shadowy depths.  This I vow, as The Dark Cavalier, I swear I shall die trying.<BR>
