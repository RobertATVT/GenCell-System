The Hall of Kings II

Born of mind, the psychics child,
we come into a tale of darkness.
A child filled with both tame and wild,
tender love shaped a heart of stone.

A normal life through teenage years,
his love grew to shape his life.
Though most men never meet their fears,
the black hand of fate would force him to live alone.

On the eve of his day of wedded bliss,
deaths cold hand fell, the roses would grow no more.
Never again would those petals feel his kiss,
a traveling misery would begin this night.

What mysteries does this life hold,
will he touch the world for good or ill?
Will he be strengthened in life, stand tall and bold,
or will he shrivel and die, in pain and blight?

And now we pause to think so far,
on the trials of a youth that under such pressure most would fold.
A child driven into the world before manhood came,
what would his future carry, for him what does fate hold?
A heroes blood flows through his veins,
though fallen from tales of history long past.
He's spiraling into oblivion, his mind and soul in pain,
but Destiny has a direction, his fate already cast.

Ten years the child would mourn,
walking through old worlds, a life of solitude.
Family severed, their hearts shattered and torn,
a fleeing youth, running from the hate that grows.

To an island wrought in mist and fear,
the hardened man comes with charge in hand.
An eternal youth, an innocence he holds dear,
a future son, a tenderness none could know.

The Hall of Kings, vault of ancestry past,
a line of heroes, noble and dark.
Lineage carried in purity until the last,
the Blood severed and scattered through time.

A furious vengeance carries the unflowered seed,
the dark wanderer comes full circle in his fate.
A flower of rage blossoms from a simple deed,
and a cursed lineage awakens to rejoin its kind.

An Alpha rises like a Phoenix born from flame,
his destiny unknown and a history lost in time.
A hidden tribe in a distant land he became,
a force of Justice, a madness carried without reason or rhyme.
What beholds this monstrous being?
His family recreated in his likeness.
What can subdue the rage that for freedom sings,
and quell his pupils sickness?

Time comes in a fury bent,
the heroes line ascends in turmoil.
To awaken a lost tribe he was sent,
and to regain his symbolic namesake.

His journey is perilous and wrought with death,
but with fractured breath he glimpses Arches long foretold.
Snow white fur is blood stained red,
glistening in the torchlight, the chill air frosted with each breath he takes.

The Hall of Kings at last was found,
A near broken body pulls itself towards it's legacy.
In this place he struggled from the ground,
To walk in pride before the faces of distant Kings.

One last battle before victory could be gained,
to face his darkness, to destroy it with control.
The clash was ended by taloned hands crimson stained,
and in the memory of this dream the sound of the Silver Martel rings.

His legacy regained, to awaken with treasure held,
worth proved by valor, honor, and pride.
A destined man, with darkness barely withheld,
in a distant land a Conclaves mother cried.
A cry of joy spoke of future days,
Lost blood may soon rejoin the fold.
He would come and learn the Traditions Ways,
Defeats treachery, strengthen his family, and rejoin new life with old.
