I thought that definition meant unbridled happiness...  an almost euphoric and oblivious state of pure joy.  I have been with an absolutley wonderful gal for a couple weeks now, everything was great.  Till that damnable Succubus Laja showed her face.  It amazes me how<BR>
someone can be so unhappy that all they can imagine is hurting anyone and anything they touch.<BR>

As we walked arm in arm the great round orb of the moon lit the land with it's pearlecent lumination.  Our breath flowed out of us like steam clouds as we talk and laughed together.  We so much enjoyed each others<BR>
company, two spirits joined like few can understand.  Not many people can boast the connection that Kim and I have made, most around here are afraid of it in fact.  The Symposium was the same as always, ever the same in this changing little town, a memorial refuge to those who seek the cold and untrusting presence of intigue and betrayal.  What a pit.  If ever there is a den of thieves an any single town this is Voletta's.  But there is no better<BR>
place to be seen and to watch the goings on of the petty squabblers attempting to gain the scraps left by their betters.  Ah, what better a place to see who your first victim shall be?<BR>

Is that too much to ask?  Is it wrong to want to be out with someone special and have fun?  No.  Never the less, you still have these cynical self absorbed monsters walking around trying to put under anything with a hope residing<BR>
within.  The seven deadly sins are alive and well in Voletta, in fact they are working overtime.  <BR>
<BR>

What an odd place this is.  The hopes of so many being displayed here like an exhibit, yet so many plots in the darkness.  Kim sits next to me, leaning on<BR>
my shoulder, her arms wrapped around me.  I sit there playing through her hair, my fingers flowing through that dark waterfall feeling the refreshing scents and textures flowing about.  She is so lovely, so caring, so much a part of me now.  We sit there in each others embrace until a voice begins ringing through my head.<BR>
	"How sweet, the little lovers in the corner."<BR>
	I slowly turned my head to lay my eyes upon the intruder, Laja of course.  She has had some interest in making this as difficult as possible.  Jealousy.<BR>
	"Hello Laja, how are you doing tonight?"  My attempt to be amiable to her the previous night didn't go well at all and Kim became furious with me because I was looking at another woman.  Little did she know at the time that I was speaking to her by stretching my mind, and it only worked if I was looking at her.<BR>
	"What do you care Victor?  You have your new toy to play with now." She sits there with a smirk on her face, her attempt at being coy doing nothing for my already aggitated state.<BR>
	"Is that jealousy I hear?  Come on Laja, I was a toy to you, nothing more.  Why are you acting like a Jealous Lover?  It's not like we had any sort of long past or commitment...  we were only together once or twice."  My mind trying to gouge wounds into her, I just want her to leave us be.<BR>
	"Jealous of that?  Are you insane?  I could kill her without trying, as a matter of fact........  I think I will.  Just because you love her."  The cold look on her face turning into a hateful snear, she just stares at me... glaring.<BR>
	My hand begins to clench against the tall mug it is wrapped around, my face set like marbled flesh.  My eyes gleaming from the lights, flaring green with hatred.  <BR>
	"Victor, what is wrong?  Victor?"  I hardly hear Kimberly adressing me, my mind in a constant verbal war with this harlot who dares to threaten her.  The anger building in me, the moons influence diving all sanity from my body, but I hold on.  <BR>
	"You will do no such thing Laja, you know I will stop you."<BR>
	"Who says that you will be anywhere around Vic?  Who said I was going to do it myself?  I just might have a toy do it for me."<BR>
	"Why would you want to have one of you toys broken, Laja?  Why would youwish death upon your sisters and anyone else you care about?  I will hunt down everything and everyone you ever held dear and close, and I will tear the life from it in front of your eyes...  And I will leave you to live out your eternity in utter despair and solitude.  This I swear"  The words thought calm and collect, cold and emotionless.  I wasn't bluffing.<BR>
	"As long as I have hurt you by killing her and making you wander miserable because you failed another future wife, when you lay another into the ground in grief, that will be enough.  Do what you want with me, I will already have won."  Her words stinging, the rage building, I didnt even notice the glass shattering in my hand.  The shards piercing my flesh, the lifes blood flowing away from me.<BR>
	"Oh my God, Victor are you alright?  Victor...  What is wrong with you?"  Kimberly shakes me and begins pulling my hand open the clenched fist driving the tiny glass blades deeper into my flesh.  The sight of the blood made her begin to feel whoozy and she ran off to the bathroom...  poor baby, she has no idea what all she is getting into.  Good now I can confront that wicked tramp and settle this, I maight even carry her out by that gooseneck I<BR>
once enjoyed tol nuzzle and admire.  I stand wrapping a dirty old rag around my hand to keep from dripping blood all over the bar...  tiny glass teeth still there biting at me.  <BR>
	"You lay a hand on her Laja and you know what I will do.... I swear to you I will. "<BR>
	"Go ahead, have your little toy, I won't hurt her...  or her precious cargo."  <BR>
	"You don't want to make a war over something so trivial Laja, so drop it."  My voice becoming a snarl,  can feel my body tense like the change is pushing at my skin to be set free.  I supress the anger as best I can, and we argue on.  Somewhere during our fight Kimberly approached and I growled for her to go back to the table...  I could see the hurt in her eyes, I could see what I had done.  But this was more important, what good is all the<BR>
niceness if she is dead?<BR>

Most people would be overjoyed to be growled at in lieu of being torn to pieces.  But hey, nobody is perfect... <BR>
