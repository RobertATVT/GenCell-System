Another two weeks went into routine legal issues, and just to make sure he could manage everything Victor went to one of the community colleges in New Orleans and enrolled in some Criminal Justice night classes.<BR>
	Notes... more and more notes... little scenes of stick figure mayhem in the margins, but nothing that would give rise to any psyche eval, just minor mayhem... the real visions were in his head.<BR>
	"Mr. Martel what are the procedures for a felony arrest?"<BR>
	His head snapped around, leaving blood trails of imagery in their wake until they finally focused on the instructor.  He nodded and blinked a few times to get the sights of the blood stains off the instructor.<BR>
	" The procedures for a Felony arrest are as follows:" He paused for a moment before beginning, giving a slight cough and clearing his throat.<BR>
	"First.  Make sure that before you proceed with any sort of arrest, your backup unit is staked out somewhere close to the incident and where the arrest is to take place."<BR>
	"Second.  Always maintain radio contact with your backup unit, informing them of position and intent."<BR>
	"Third.  You must observe the crime as it takes place."<BR>
	"Fourth.  You should have your weapon drawn and ready in the event that you are forced to return fire for you and your partners defense.  Of course you must observe the procedures for return fire and disharging of your sidearm for the full details."<BR>
	"Fifth.  You must Identify yourself as a Law enforcement officer, declaring that you are Sherrif's Department."<BR>
	"Sixth.  Inform the suspect to remain still and place his or her hands on their head.  Should the suspect run, follow them on foot and try to maintain radio contact.  If the suspect attempts an aggressive action such as drawing a weapon or attack, respond as pointed out in procedures for use of force."<BR>
	"Seventh.  Once it apperas safe, cautiously approach the suspect with handcuffs ready.  Some suspects will wait until the officer is closer before they are hit with bouts of stupidity, so the officer should be ready to deal with any threats at all times."<BR>
	"Eight.  Search the suspect, look for any illegal paraphanalia, or weapons."<BR>
	"Ninth.  Advise the suspect of their Miranda Rights and that they are under arrest."<BR>
	"Tenth.  Transport the prisoner to Jail, do not pass go... go directly to jail."<BR>
	With that he looked back down to his note papers... not needing any acknowledgement from the instructor, he knew he was right.  He of course heard the instructor speaking to him, but it was more faint than usual... his keen attention seeming to melt away, hardly able to pick out the conversations in this room.  Hmmm... what a peculiar developement, he's always been able to pick conversations right out of the busiest and most rambunctious bars... and now he can barely pick out that of the guy a few rows behind him.....  crapola.  The weeks of training went by, Vic listened and wrote... note after note... Thieving all the knowledge he could from the instructor, and asking several vital questions when needed.  His mind worked directly with the man, pushing for information and pulling it from him in areas that he needed.  All was done for reason... Victor would arm himself with as much knowledge as possible.</B></FONT></HTML>
