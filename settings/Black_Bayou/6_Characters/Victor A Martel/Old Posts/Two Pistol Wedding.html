Ever just up and did something?  No rhyme or reason?  No sense to it at all?  Well here I was, sitting in the Symposum about to melt into tears casue Petra was singing some very sad tunes, and frankly the resemblance to Solange far to close.  So what do I do?  Go outside so nobody can see them like any smart man would do.  So I clean up my face and decide to quit being such  danged pansy and deal with it. So I go back inside...  no biggy, I have<BR>
walked through those doors hundreds of times, but this time the sight of Ceile (Who I left sitting in there like a dope) sitting there the lights refracting off her hair and making her look all illuminated and holy like... darn near knocked me off my feet right there.  When I went back in Roland had taken ove the stage in all his goofiness and cheered things up a bit.  <BR>
<BR>
Suddenly I felt the common feeling of his voice in my mind >>I do weddings too you know<< the goofy smile on his face all to blissful.  Then it popped, right here, right now... I was marrying her.  So I stretched my mind to his >>You know a priest?  I wanna marry Ceile right now<<.  Then my mind went to Ceile >>Wanna get married right here?  Tonight?<<.<BR>
<BR>
The look on her eyes was utter shock and happiness... >>Yeah, sure.... <<, she was taken aback by the suddeness. >>I thought you wanted it big and in a Cathedral?<<<BR>
<BR>
>>That can come later...  I want this now<<<BR>
<BR>
And before I knew it, Evan was my best man, Lexi as the ringbearer, ann played the part of the flower girl, and Skye was Maid of honor.  All on stage before Roland who would lead the ceremony in true jamaican style.  It was the most serious I had ever seen the gunslingin oddball.  It was like he was giving away his own son for heavens sake. <BR>
<BR>
He removed his coat, pistols shown in all there steely glory at his sides and stepped forward on the stage.  "Victor, son of Alexander, please step forward with your bride".<BR>
<BR>
I obliged and made my way forward with Ceile on my arm, the look on her face was wide eyed nervousness...  she clenched my arm tight as a vice and soon we were right in front of Roland... a goofy grin plastered on my face.<BR>
<BR>
Roland juts his chest out all official and proud like " You have come before me to commit to Ka Mai, you will be one in body and Spirit.  Is this correct Victor?"<BR>
<BR>
I caught a glimpse of her in the corner of my eye, and looked at her fully... no more worries...  no more pain.  "Yes it is".<BR>
<BR>
With a moderately goofy wink he looked at Ceile, then Roland took that official tone again "And you Ceile?"<BR>
<BR>
She stood there, dressed casually, me in black leather and a stomach full of knots and twisted steel, waiting for the answer... "Yes"  she said softly, through nerve wracked and trembling lips of godlike quality... I thought I was going to fall to the floor but didn't budge...  this was it.<BR>
<BR>
"Ceile, step forward and be counted ." and when he say that she shakily pulls her arm from Victors and steps forward.  "Do you stand before me and find yourself worthy of this union?  Is what you say here this night true?"<BR>
<BR>
"Yes it is"  was all that was uttered before stepping back to be at Victors side, looking at him happily.<BR>
<BR>
"Victor, Son of Alexander, step forward and be counted".  With a small step I made the required distance, not wanting to tear myself from her side, but it was needed.  I look down to Rolands eyes, feeling like something frowm a star wars movie, big wookie of a Vic standing before Lando at Cloud city.  I had this gleefull stupid grin on my face.<BR>
<BR>
"Do you come before me worthy of this union? Is what you say here this night truth?". And without pause, eyes locked with his, not a doubt in mind.<BR>
<BR>
"Yes I am".<BR>
<BR>
With a smile of honest sincerity Roland look at vic with a nod. "Your father sees you very well, Victor.  You may step back now." and without pause I do.  Making my way to lock arms with her again.<BR>
<BR>
"We have all just witnessed the sacred Ka Mai, let no man put what has transpired here tonight asunder.  Victor... Kiss the Bride man".. Smiling at the two again.<BR>
<BR>
With a tear eyed turn he faces her and hold each side of her face in his hands and kisses her...  joy just spilling from him in waves.<BR>
<BR>
"It is done" and with that Roland puts his jacket back on... and looks about for more victims to marry... and while the next bout of insanity the newlyweds slip into more dimly lit sections of the symp to hold each other and figure out if what just happened and what happens later was actually real or just a figment of bad beer.  But I will talk about all that whackiness later.<BR>
