</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SCRIPT" FACE="Comic Sans MS" LANG="0">(XP'd in Natural Predators, thanks to Skye and the rest of my pack...  and sorry this is late, I have had some real problems with my AOL lately I'm sure you understand)<BR>
<BR>
   I could feel the moon tugging at my emotions and making my anger rush to the forefront.  Like in the nightmares I had while in the coma my vision would redden at the edges and my skin would feel like I was wreathed in flames.  I knew better than to stay in Voletta anytime near the full moon, for my creator had told me of the rage that would come upon me.  I decided to spend a couple days away, in New Orleans where another crime would go much less<BR>
noticed.  I couldn't seem to keep my anger in check lately and I was seeming to lose his friends with an alarming rapidity.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>  The streets of New Orleans screamed with pitiful vagrants and screaming youths..  I walked the back streets trying to evade notice and unwanted attention by the authoraties.  I had no idea when the change would occur for this was my first change ,and this event would alter my life forever.  The air was thick and muggy, the smell of sweat and refuse permeated everything nearby.  Gunshots and crying<BR>
children filled the night air like scenes from an urban war, the taste of hatred seethed from every corner...  and I could feel it coming.  Pain like I had never felt before shot through my body, like someone was peeling the skin from my body.  I have been beaten, shot, stabbed, just about everything a body can go through witout shutting down, and nothing compared to this....<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>  My creator is a gentle, loving woman that I loved more than life.  It was a confusing kind of emotion, one that I had pushed away for years as I ran from the ghost of my beloved Suzette.  I didn't lust for her, and as a matter of fact I didn't really think of her in that way, now don't get me wrong, I was certainly attracted to her but it was a more simple, base kind of emotion, and it was stronger<BR>
since the incident in the woods.  She has done her best to teach me and train him for this moment, but to be honest, nothing could really do that.  When the beast comes to you, your mortal frame is infused with the most primal and feral spirit of the wolf and part animal you become.  Not like a simple beast, but a powerful cunning predator that understands tactics and how to take down any larger or superior prey.  That's why I left, I didn't want to<BR>
cause trouble or hurt someone undeserving of persecution and possible death.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>  I fell to the street in agony, falling to my hands and knees, the pain making me regurgitate the dinner I had half an hour ago.  The venom of my creator mystically infusing with every cell, seemingly shredding every cell and rebuilding my entire body.  People nearby passed by me like I was a cockroach, not wanting to get involved is a big city survival instinct.  A couple people stopped and looked<BR>
for a few moments, but I screemed for them to run from me.  The woman tried to help me but the change was taking over and my bestial visage scared her from me.  I was glad for her in a way, although her kind yet fragile mind may be scarred forever by that few moments.  The change had come and I was once again the ravenous beast that I remembered from long ago, the beast that murdered my one love.  Someone will pay for that one tonight.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>  We talked about her past with the change, she's not much older than I am, when it comes to wolf years that is.  Skye has helped me get through a lot, most of all she managed to get me to become a member of the pack, for that I owe her everything I am.  Skye is my gentle teacher and she speaks with beauty and care.  All of the pack members seem to be the cream of the crop, or the pick of the litter<BR>
if you may.  Syn is our Alpha, she's a tough and somewhat brutal chick actually, but she is what this disfunctional bunch needs.  She's a looker to if you can get past the armored and air conditioned exterior.  Evan is my friend and beta, he is like a brother to me, and a hero.  He carries the bearing and the wisdom of the pure ones with him wherever he goes.  The other members that I have met thus far are of course Skye, Javin, Melanie, Sabrina, and<BR>
myself. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>  I stand to my full height, towering above anything I have ever seen on two legs, and I roar a growl that should have leveled the shanties that surrounded me.  At some point through my change it started to drizzle a light cool rain, people were stirring and quickly getting to their destinations...  of course till I am in vision. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  The man walked with his head down, the night had been a rough one and he hoped that his wife hadn't changed the locks again.  It began to rain while he was still 6 blocks from his home, a cheap run-down apartment in one of the worst sections of New Orleans.  "Just wonderful, if she has changed the locks I swear..." he thought as he walked head down in the cold drizzling rain.  He covered his head with<BR>
a newspaper and continued his dismal nightly pilgramage.  Thoughts of leavig his wretched wife and getting a new apartment in a better part of town filled his head.  Visions of scantily clad beauties at work made his homecoming almost too unbearable, and seemed to rip out a part of him every evening.  As he walked he heard a dog howling in the night air, he really hated the dog's in this neighborhood, they were almost as bad as the humans.  With a<BR>
sudden jolt he slammed into a wall, at least he thought it was a wall...  but walls don't have big furry feet.  Walls don't breath either... they sure as heck don't growl.  Suddenly a terror rushed through him as he looked up and saw the large hairy chest and the huge wolfen head sitting atop the shoulders of this massive beast...  one thing to do... RUN!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  The man had bumped right into me as I stood and howled, I turned to face this oblivious idiot pulling my arm back to swing just as he ran off screaming....  without even a thought I tore off after him.  running mostly on hands and feet I bounded after him, finally leaping over him and landing right in front of him.  The poor soul screamed and tried to change directions but could only dance maddeningly<BR>
into my claws...  He died quickly as I tore him apart with tooth and claw.  Slowly my mind began to feel again, the cold numbness lifting like a hood from me.   My body once again shot with pain as the full realisation of I had just commited splashed across my now vivid memory.  As I changed back to my human form a sorrow took over me like the day I found out about my love, my Suzzete....  The only difference is that I know that I commited this<BR>
atrocity, that I have truely become the monster that I dreamed.  <BR>
<BR>
  I wandered in grief for a few minutes, naked and not knowing where I was going.  The streets where empty, the rain washing the blood and gore from my body as I walked in shock.  Finally I ended up arriving at my car, the black 3000gt gleaming in the rain.  My mind was clearer now, and I reached under the car for the safety key that I had installed.  Taking the key I opened the car and climbed in, my wet naked bottom sliding across the leather<BR>
seats...  a more uncomfortable feeling I had never before witnessed.  After drying off and getting dressed again I drove to where I had bumped into the man, seeing the packs of dogs fighting over something, I hope that it's not him.  I opened the door and scooped up what was left of my clothing and drove off, guess it's safe to return home now.   I hope.<BR>
