	It's funny what it takes to unite those of a similar strain.  Long I held the notion of all the wolves in this town working together and helping one another if in need.  Was it forsight and vision?  How was I to know that 14 years ago we would be forced to share the same crawlspace, the same dingy holes to hide in?  It sure as hell wasn't luck.<BR>
<BR>
	Everywhere I turn I see people I would die for, great men and women with a cause that years ago I would have been accused of being a madman for doing.  Something that I was doing years ago anyhow.  Killing evil.  A lot of people didn't understand, and I feel like I didn't do enough.  Now we are all losing ground day by day, our numbers dwindling.  It was all that could be done to contain my anger when Evan's desecrated body made it's way to us, Briggs and Damian held me down until Rya could speak sense to me.  Once upon a time the form I wear knew nothing but anger, this form knew only destruction, now I am in control of it.  <BR>
<BR>
	Evan, my surrogate father, the man I looked up to more than any other living person on earth.  Rya calmed me, she was my mate now... our grief shared in the comfort of one another, only she could get me to drop this form for any length of time.  Once again she talked sense into my hazed mind, she was strong and I loved her for it.  I some deeply recessed part of me I loved them all.  Through adveristy our goals had been combined into on focus.  <BR>
<BR>
	Now was the time for battle though, what was left of the Guardians would be called to my side and the Hammer raised against the perverse abominations, these Dark Ones.  Relentless assaults, day and night, is what we contended with every day a battle without rest.  This time was our fight, a few others followed in with us that was the way of it now.  We had shifts some would go out on missions while others stayed here to protect the foundry, I was working on setting up a tunnel system out of the foundry that would allow us escape if needed, thats when this strike hit us, my shift. <BR>
<BR>
	To battle we went, again.  Briggs joined us on this one and I was glad to have him at my side, he was a soldier and a warrior in all reguards.  Once we were strangers meeting once on the steps of the Symposium over Brian being under his protection.  I had grown fond of Brian in all this, our differences settled and put to the past.  All of us did that now, all of us were family in a way.  We shared blood, we shared food, and more than anything we shared trust.  I had even grown to like Briggs.<BR>
<BR>
	This fight was over without much trouble, we were becoming more familiar with fighting here, we had come to know it intimately, ever rock, every bone left in the sun.  Side to side Briggs and I fought, two leaders, two warriors... two men seeking vengeance for those they had lost.  Mordithius would be mine, I longed to drive the sharpened end haft into his chest and watch the fear in his eyes as he died.  For Jordan, Ashley, Little Victor, Ceile, Laura, Jack, Evan, Sasha, Aton, Seth, Alicia, Gabriel, Nate, Aris, Brian, and the rest I didn't even know and for the ones whose bodies are still unkown...  for each of them I howled silently in my head each night, for each of them I cried long tears everytime I let my eyes shut.  Each nightmare filled night, each casualty filled day.  Will the flow of blood end?  Is this our river of blood?<BR>
