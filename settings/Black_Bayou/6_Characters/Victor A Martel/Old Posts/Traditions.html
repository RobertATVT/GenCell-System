	He stood there amidst the old ways, a stranger in a strange land.  he knew none of these wolves here, their line dating back centuries and some of their ages just as ancient.  These were the wolves of the Old World, this is the beginning.<BR>
	"Why have you come here?"  The lean sandy haired elder stood there pacing in front of the white haired Alpha, his questions were direct and the look in his eyes spoke volumes.<BR>
	"I was born and raised here, in Barcelona actually."  Victor looked at the man without fear, he wasn't being defiant really, you just get that when a man no longer has the will to live.<BR>
	"Who made you?" The other elder, a black haired man of great stature stood there with massive arms crossed across his chest.  He watched the broken man before him with disdain and mingled curiosity.<BR>
	"My sire is not from these lands and is of no consequence to you."  He answered plainly, caring not what these strangers woul do to him.  his mind flowed back tot he memory of how he was found.  Weeks ago he had been roaming the land, having left the children with his mother he decided to jouney.  He was in a wooden area, no idea where he was really, he'd been roaming for over a week and cared not where he ended up.  He never heard or smelled them until it was too late.  Breaking out of the outlying brush he was pinned by the jaws of another massive wolf, but he reared back and threw the creature off his back and growled low in his throat.  A few more burst forth and snapped and snarled at him, circling him lik prey.  After long moments of being circled and snapping back at the others, an old tan wolf came onto the path and his vision went black and he fell to the ground.<BR>
	"We will decide what is of consequence.  Where are you from?"  The female elder spoke finally, her voice was soothing and gentle, he almost wanted to tell her his entire past but with a few blinks he brought himself to reason and stared her into the eyes with a curl of his lip.<BR>
	"I'm from America most recently.  I've travelled and called many places my home." He's not giving in to these people, he will not betray his home to these strangers.<BR>
	Suddenly a rock flew from his side and caught him in the temple, his legged weakened and he stumbled for a moment.  The restraints they had on him could have been broken, if he had the desire to do so, but at this point he didn't care.  He twisted his head and looked at the brown and grey haired man that threw it.  He was smiling, he was challenging him, this was the wolf that he threw off in the forest, apparently the hunters pride was injured.<BR>
	"Why are you here?" The sandy haired elder, Marcus, asked as he moved within arms reach of the Alpha.<BR>
	"I came here to bring my family to safety, to get them away from those that kill our kind"  His voice still even and calm, not thinking this information would be too much.  It was true, that is why he brought his family to Spain.<BR>
	He felt the large black haired man grasp him by the neck and felt the change come over the man as he was held.  The rough tanned hand that held him sprouted sable fur and before him the Horus wolf stood, black as midnight and nearly matching him in size.<BR>
	"What do you know of the Inquisitors, New Worlder?" The sable wolf gurgled out the question, rage building on his lips, his eyes almost burned in the light of the bonfire.  His hand squeezed hard on Victors throat.<BR>
	"Gunnar, that is enough, put him down." The woman spoke calmly, her tone commanding in it's gentleness.<BR>
	Victor hadn't realized that his feet were lifted from the ground, his attention spent on the germanic beast before him.  He was ready to fight this man, even if it meant his certain death.  But all the thoughts of battle fled as he hit the ground, tossed away by Gunnar at the wmans command, he rolled and layed there looking up at the beast.<BR>
	"I know they almost killed my son, and if not by the mercy of God he wouldn't have seen his second birthday this year to come.  I know I killed the bastard that delivered the head of my friends wife to him in a box, which I returned in kind as vengeance.  I know that even now there are those that plot todestory my family." He stood to his feet, the air chill across his naked body as he stood defiently and moved back to Gunnar, standing and looking him in the face as well as he could.  "I also know that if you touch me again I will remove your arm, you want to kill me..."<BR>
	"Enough Victor, this is not about your death.  We are very weary, we have to be sure of your intentions.  There is a lot about the past year that you don't know.  There is also a lot about our kind that you do not know.  I sense the power in you, I can see that you are also an Alpha.  You came here to die didn't you Victor?  Is that why you travelled without your pack across the land?  Why do you seek death?"  The woman was amazing, her red hair spilled across her back and shoulder like a spring of fire bubbling from a statue carved in exquisite detail.  She was beautiful, but he was sure that she was tenfold his age, she had abilities he had never even heard rumor of.<BR>
	"I tire of things, I tire of the struggle that tears at me.  My family is falling apart in my hands, and I fear that I will lose greatly soon.  I hear ambition in their words, I hear defience in their thoughts, I see unrest in the spirits.  I seek to protect those unable to do so themselves, yet I am a monster for it.  I avenge those that have been wronged, but I am playing God.  I watch over my family, but I don't spend enough time with them.  I am a failure as an Alpha, and all I desire is to kill.  I struggle trying to make my way and teach my pups, while watching those around me drive our essence to the dirt.  Everything I know I learned on my own, I can't teach them what I myself don't know.  Maybe I didn't come here to die, maybe I came here to learn?"  He closed his eyes and brought his beast to the front, his body stretching and rending the weak manacles around his wrist, the cold steal snapping and falling to the ground at his feet.  With a sigh he opened his pale green eyes and leveled them on her.  "You know my name, I know my lineage.  I have come here to reclaim that which is rightfully mine."<BR>
	Gunnar stepped back a few paces as he shifted, the look on his face more confusion, like he was shocked, certainly not scared.  His voice came out in a great quiet rumble as his eyes shifted to the woman. "Marie, who is he?"<BR>
	Marcus steppes forth to join the two other Elders, as mumbled curses and challenges came from the forty some odd gathered wolves behind Victor.  He looked up Victor and smiled, not a mocking smile but one of understanding.<BR>
	"Very good Victor, you have come here to learn have you? " The old mans voice broke the mumbling as he stood in front of Gunnar, between him and Victor.  "Then know this, we lost many of our kind across the world, because we were betrayed by our own kind.  A rather large pack from Italy sold us to the Hunters, they haned two packs to them on silver platters.  We have just recently learned this, thus the reason for our distrust of strangers.  You came in time for a conclave of our packs, we get together and revel in our survival, we discuss rumors and lore.  This is the Gathering Victor.  This is all we have left, besides the pack in Italy we are all we know of left, and the Italians are soon to join.  Then they will suffer for their actions.  That is our way."<BR>
	"As the elders, we have decided that this betrayal will only be resolved when their Alpha lies dead at our feet.  Then his blood shall be split between the remaining packs to serve as Omega's until they prove themselves worthy.  No blood shall be wasted."  Marie's beautifully calm voice met his ears.  So much like Ceile.  Would Ceile become this strong, would she finally learn our ways?  "And when all is said and done, Gunnar will take the Italians Mate as his own, to replace his lost wife."<BR>
	"How can you take his pups as your own?" Victors voice stammered out... he knew of no way to do this before, it had come up with Jillian but the ability was beyond his grasp.<BR>
	"It's similar to a ritual of creation Victor.  Your kind is cut off from the rest of us, we knew that you existed but your spirits are cut off from ours.  Without that link to the past, you cannot learn our ways Victor.  We are taught by those that came before us, like your line which we feared was erradicated and driven to the dust.  We are glad to see that you came back to us Martel.  We have long mourned your passing.  It's time to rest though, we will speak in the morning.  Welcome Victor."<BR>
	After changing back to his birth form Victor was given clothing to wear, and a place to stay.  Seems that this place was a resort at one time, now grown over and returned to the wild.  Vines and grasses grew through the floors of the small cabin that circled the gathering area, his cabin was untouched by man in years, now wolf stayed here... interesting indeed.  He threw the clothes, a pair of boots, a tunic, and a pair of breeches, onto the floor and changed to his wolf form and nesteld himself out a fairly tolerable den.  Sleep took him quickly.<BR>
