	Alrighty, Here we go...  drinking, dancing and anything else that would make your grandmother blush and your pops give you the thumbs up.  Most of it is the anything else though.  Oh I'm sorry, what am I talking about?  Well it could only be one thing you know....<BR>

	Yeah that's right, THE pirate ship.   You see through history there have been many well known pirates and their ships, course I don;t know them cause once you know King Jerod, Admiral Otis, Captain Roland and the rest of their merry band of malcontents and disfunctional briggands there can be no others and the rest are very soon forgotten.  <BR>
<BR>
	::passes out some "special" brownies to the kids as they sit around Ole Man Vics feet listening to the story::<BR>
<BR>
	The Spliff is a ship inmmortal, the fun never ends and the bliss is unparalleled.  You got whackos swinging from the main mast and girls running around in tight little Vinyl outfits.  Vinyl was before your time, they outlawed it way back in 2026 for some chemical that was included in the making of it that drove men to blithering idiots... but I never heard complaints. <g>  And I will tell you another thing, Miss Cleo in Vinyl was like a slice of<BR>
heaven, at least till that night we managed to get Grandma Ceile into it... boy she has always been one hot number.  But I digress...  People swinging from the main mast and diving from the crows nest, Captain Roland passing around his momma's homemade brownies.  And then you had me tending ba right in the middle of it making it all worse with my crazed and whacked out drinks...  Those were the days I tell ya.  Course I was a lot younger and there<BR>
was a lot less of me then too...<BR>
<BR>
	 ::pats his nicely rounded belly and chuckles much like an Urban Primitive Santa::<BR>
<BR>
	Now you have never seen a Pirate ship like this before, I mean with a pug dog as Admiral, a gypsy boy as the Captain of the Guard, a Torture specialist, I mean... come on, could Treasure Islan compare to this?  No, I say.  It surely could not.  Jimmy, quit hogging all the brownies you little wormy jerk, I will bite off your face if I don't get any!  Now where was I?  Oh yeah, Cleo was walking through charcoal embers trying to be miss tough gal, and<BR>
there is Roland dancing half naked in smily face boxers...<BR>
<BR>
	::Gets quiet all of a sudden with a confused look on his face::<BR>
<BR>
	No that is another story... you kids don't need to hear that one just yet.  So we do nothing but party on like crazy till the crack of dawn and everyone walks, crawls, or twitches there way home and when the next day rolls around...  we come right back for more.  I mean, how could you miss drunken debauchery like that and still call yourself alive, or back alive, or unalive, or whatever...    I have seen all kinds of things in my time, but nothing<BR>
like the Spliff... there can be no comparison, no equal, no legend greater.  And you know what, on a calm night, if you sit out here on the docks and try real hard, you can still hear the cannons booming far off in the distance.  And better yet, once in a while you can even see her ghostly form floatig on the waters here in the gulf and hear the people enjoying their lives to the fullest.  I have been there, I have seen it.  I have even made the<BR>
drinks that helped enliven the mood.  I know people tell you there is no such things as Werewolves and Vampires, and that the Spliff was never here...  but let Ole Vic clue you in...  forget Furballs and Fangers, nothin in this place mattered like the Spliff, the only place where we were all equal...  equally drunk and equally happy.  It's still out there you know.  maybe some day I will sprinkle you with Fromunda dust and fly you there, but that is<BR>
an adventure for another time.<BR>
<BR>
