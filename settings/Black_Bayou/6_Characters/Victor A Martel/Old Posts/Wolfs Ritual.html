Victor had called him and ask that he come to eEclipse right away, something seemed urgent but was never said. So here he was. He had not spoken to Vic sence they where in Kosovo, but he had to go back to Scotland to see his son, who had come down with an illness. Now he had come back and been alone for sometime, until he and Ann had started training for no apparent reason, and now Vic want him here. He shrugged and knocked on the office door, after a moment it opened and Vic stepped aside, "Come in." He offered with a wave of his hand. After a moment of silence Wolf walked to a chair and sat, Vic stepping around his desk,  not sitting, stared out his window. <BR>
	"You remember that whole thing you went through with your dreams, and  I showed you what you where?" He turned looking at Wolf, who nodded. <BR>
	"Well, I'd like you to join us now." Victor watched Wolf for his reaction, which was a mixture of astonishment, excitment, and relief. <BR>
	"When do we do this?" he spoutted at Vic.<BR>
	"Tonight, if you want," again waiting for Wolf's reaction that was nothing more then a nod, "Alright then let's go."<BR>
<BR>
	With in a moment both men where in the Lamborghini LM002, speeding away from Eclipse, toward, what was to Wolf, an unknown destination, but to Vic it was a familiar one. They rode in silence not because they didn't want to talk but more because Wolf was prepareing to become what he once was from his birth, but what he had lost in a battle with a Lamia. His mind race as he stared out the window of the LM002, the dreams comeing to him in waves as he remembered more with every second, everything was comeing back, the scar on his face, love in Voletta, his old pack, all of it like a flood on his psychi. The LM002 made a sharp turn onto the beach, and Wolf was snapped from the vice that help his mind. Vic turned to him, "Where here".  They got out of the Hummer like vehcile, Vic leading the way into the woods to a clearing surrounded by tourches.<BR>
<BR>
	"What do you need," Wolf asked, watching Vic move, withdrawing a strange object and handing it to Wolf.<BR>
"Cut yourself," he said with comeplete seriousness in his voice.<BR>
Wolf dragged the blade acrossed the palm of his hand, letting the blood flowing into the strange tube/knife contraption. When there was enough he gave it to Vic, who had built a fire in the center of the clearing, the dream of a beast jumping through the fire at him come to mind. Vic began to damn and sing in a primitive fashion, Wolf had seen and heard this before and joined in quickly. A slight wind kicked up and an eerie chant came from the wood occampaning there own voice, soon a rythmic drum was heard keeping candance. <BR>
<BR>
	For six hours they dance and sang with those egnamatic voices and drums from the woods, at some point his blood was spilled on the fire, slowly over ths six hours Victor changed, instictivly Wolf knew when to run, at the same moment a low guteral voice yelled to him to do what he had already told himself to do, as did the voices in the woods, but he was ahead of the both and on his way, his legs caring him as fast as they could. Never before had he been hunted, the rush of adrinaline shot through him, and he smiled at the thought, finally he would be what he was meant to be again. <BR>
	<BR>
	Victor, now the beast that had haunted Wolf in dreams for months, was now onto Wolf's scent and hot on his trail, again in clomplete control of this horrid form. Wolf was farther ahead then expected, but after six mintues of running, the beast had him, bringing him to the ground and sinking it's teeth deep into Wolf's shoulder, the green liquor seeping into the bite wounds. <BR>
<BR>
	Wolf winced at the pain and was dropped as Vic ran into the woods. For a moment he laid there. The "venom" corsing through him. He laughed a bit. His deepest desire and need, was now a new reality. Again he would be whole.</HTML>
