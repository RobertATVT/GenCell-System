Are we all merely test subjects in a great cosmic petri dish?  Soemtimes it feels like it.  Sometimes I sit here and think of what would have happened if, and what won't happen if...  Not that it does any good mind you, sometimes it's best not to ask yourself questions<BR>
that cannot be answered.  Keeps your hair from gowing white... oops, too late for some of us.  In the end, the inevitable happens though... memories float through my mind like small portals to the past, the only real way humanity will ever travel time.  And then one hits...<BR>
	"Where are you running to?"  The youthful male voice calls out with exuberance, a little huff to his words as usual when children run and talk.  <BR>
	"To the maze silly, I have to show you something secret" The returning voice remembered as an enchanting silvery tone, her voice was always so lovely, how it would have sounded if she had the chance to grow older.  The following laughter could almost be seen as shining trails of fae lights.<BR>
	The memory shifted to the depths of the maze, the small marble bench surrounded by lush green foliage.  The girl sat there with a face rimmed in the purest gold locks, lying in loose natural rings across her face and shoulders.  The small face cradled there was like a picture creted in perfection by the hands of Michaelangelo, cupid bowed lips of the softest pink needed nothing to accentuate them against the pale china complexion that layed across<BR>
her face and neck.  She smiled up to the dark young boy that stood next to her, he was large for his age, always had been.  His bright green eyes held happiness and mirth, such a contrast to the emotion held in the same eyes in the future.  Dark close cropped hair framed the youthful bonze fleshed face as he looked at her with love and compassion.  His face was darkly angelic as well, youthful and vibrant, bright and commanding.<BR>
	"I got something for you...  I know how you are about it, but I think you won't mind this much."  A bashful blush spread across her cheeks, her eyes held the need for confirmation.  Seeking aggreeance and acceptance from the small youth.  He stood there quiet for a few moments then smiled down to her and sat next to her.<BR>
	"Alright, what did you get me, and you know I will have to get you something in return." Smiling he places his hand on hers and gives it a gentle squeeze.  Looking to her awaiting for her to show him, he always felt uneasy receiving gifts without having something to give in return.  After a few embarrassed giggles she pulls her hand out from behind her and holds it out to him fist clenched and her palm down waiting for him to hold his hand out.<BR>
