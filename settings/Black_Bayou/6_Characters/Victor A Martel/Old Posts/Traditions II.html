He stretched lazily through the undergrowth that had overtaken the floor of this once finely crafted place and let the rays shine across his fur, though the air was chill the spotlights of sunlight felt amazing on his skin and fur.  He layed there a while, pondering over his situation, and seriously thinking about trying to make a break for it.  Then he heard rustling outside and his head lifted towards the door as a rather large shadow overtook it.<BR>
	"Get up Martel, you aren't out of the woods yet." Gunnar's deep gruff germanic voice rang out through the morning silence.  If a wolf could sigh, it seems that Gunnar has decided to wake up early to teach the newcomer some "manners".<BR>
	"Oh well" thought Victor as he changed into his birth form and got his first morning stretch, groaning into the morning air as he did. ""I'll at least get in a few hits, and I'll for sure clip his satchel before I go down"<BR>
	"Do you Americans always take this long to get ready?"  Once again the resonating voice came from behind him as he pulled on the archaic clothing, surely he looked like the goofiest slot in the Gathering.<BR>
	"Shut up Gunnar, why don't you eat a rather large bowl of my backside.  You are the last prejudiced Neanderthal I want to hear while waking up."  Victors voice came back snappish, he really didn't like the german much, even though they were probably more alike than he'd like to consider.<BR>
	"What's wrong, did I hit a sore spot with the pretty boy?  Sorry I don't have mirror so you can fix your hair."  A chuckling snort was accompanied by a grab as Gunnar grabbed Victor by the scruff and drug him to the door.  "You should be glad that Marie likes you little american boy.  You would have been dead by the time you got changed to the Horus."<BR>
	"Pleasent thought Gunnar, not that I think you are man enough to do it." A smile crossed his lips as Gunnar pushed him forward and released his neck.  Then he saw that Marie was waiting for him, standing there leaning against his bungalow watching him and Gunnar.  Funny thing is apparently Gunnar had even less of a clue because something skin to a whimper came from him as Marie's expression darkened while Victor watched her.  <BR>
	"You will not strike a man in the back Gunnar, what have I taught you?"  Her voice rang out, stern yet beautiful.  She was certainly a wonder to behold, gorgeous and strong.  victor wate for Gunnars response but all he heard was a gurgle from behind him and he was to entranced to turn away from Marie.<BR>
	"Go back to your den and think about how you've treated our guest.  When you have come to a decision, return and speak to me."  Her hand flinched for the most brief moment and gunnar could be heard cursing low and walking away from the two of them.<BR>
	"You didn't have to do that Marie, he'll just hate me worse for it, let him hit me if he feels the need, I'll get better."  Victor tried his best smile, but he was very intimidated by this woman, she used powers that he had never before even heard rumor of.  He walked up next to her, apparently she would be his teacher through all this.<BR>
	"Gunnar feels that you threaten his place here.  You are nearly as strong as he is, and new to the group.  Already several of the others whisper about you, and Gunnar fears that your defiance of him is a challenge to his place.  You see Victor, Gunnar is our...  How's a good way to put this.  He's our general, as well as the one that enforces our ways.  You have no idea what I'm talking baout do you?"  Her face was always serene, and this moment was no exception.  She looked at him like a mother, a teacher, a judge...  her eyes spoke volumes.<BR>
	"I'm afraid not, I just know what I've had to learn on my own.  I've spent time with a wolf pack in Alaska, I learned what i could from them.  We have no real elders where I come from, the ones that are there have taught us nothing. "  Victor walked next to her, and clasped his hands behind his back, not having pockets to stuff them in.  This place was a bit odd, but overall not bad.  He looked around the place and saw that wherever they went the other wolves watched them, watched him mostly.<BR>
	"In our society every pack serves a purpose.  That purpose is determined by the station of the Alpha.  Gunnar leads us in Wartime, Marcus heals us, I am our judge, Antoni was our knowledge keeper.  Now he has betrayed us, and our judgement will come swiftly.  He arrives tonight, and you will assist us in the hunt.  See that's how we survive, we all do our part, and nothing changes that.  We are part of the Cycle Victor, and only through having laws do we maintain our ability to protect that.  Our society is rigid, but it's for a good reason Victor, and your defience towards Gunnar is sending out the wrong ripples.  His pack is ready to tear you apart, but they won't cross me.  I have judged you guilty of no crime."  She smiled at him and continued walking.<BR>
	"So there are laws that we must abide by?  Why is it that none of my people know any of this?  Why are we so seperated from the ways?"  Victor was getting more confused by the moment, how could they allow a goup of wolves, easily as large as they were, be stranded from the true ways?<BR>
	"We aren't sure how that came to pass, we can't watch over every wolf, apparently one got away from us, or someone was wolfed and left to their own devices.  I couldn't answer that question, but I can teach you the ways and you can carry them to your people.  Teach your family and any others that listen, though I don't expect all will want to follow them.  It seems your path is taking another route Victor, I had hoped that you would take your part with us.  I had hoped that the line of Charlemagne and Charles Martel would rejoin us, but that won't happen will it?"  She spoke the last line quietly, almost like she was already in morning for him.  Her eyes watched him as they walked, a deep blue ocean of knowledge and experience bored into him as they walked.<BR>
	"I'm afraid not, not anytime soon.  I have a responsibility to those that remain there, and I won't leave my family.  I can't just turn my back on that place Marie, even though I despise the corruption that eats at it."  Victors heart sank deeply, he had always wanted to feel like he belonged to something greater, and here he had the chance to do so.  But he knew that he couldn't stay here, he would learn all he could from these old nobles and take that knowledge to share with the others in voletta.  Thus his teaching began.</B></I></HTML>
