LexMartel: 	::he is delusional he is doing Pakua in disguise::
Evn Walker: 	still pounding from the incident earlier, the doctor's let him
out of the hospital after a 
LexMartel: 	::shrugs and Tai Chi is a good warmup::
Evn Walker: 	few hours of trying to convince him he was fine.  Dressed in a
pair of faded jeans, a 
Evn Walker: 	metallica tee.  The specialy made double holster shoulder
harness with extra amma clips and 
Evn Walker: 	a handcuff pocket snapped into place, not very concealable...
but with a leather jacket to 
Evn Walker: 	cover it there is no worries::
Victor A Martel: 	Lex, try this... ::Steps beside him and begins the Sweeping
Cross Mantis kata, his loose ~
LexMartel: 	::he stops his routine to bow to his sifu,Alpha, and Father::
Victor A Martel: 	black pants swoosh as his wide movements carry him across
the mat::
LexMartel: 	::nodding he watches him and then copies him::
Evn Walker: 	::Swinging his hand out he tests the door, opening it when he
finds it unlocked he slips in,
Evn Walker: 	allowing it to shut behind him quietly::
Victor A Martel: 	::Steps back and watches:: Try it again... you're close...
LexMartel: 	::nodding he moves to try it again,a look of determination upon
his brow::
Evn Walker: 	::Covering his eyes are a pair of shades to keep bright lights
from adding the the headache,
Victor A Martel: 	::Hears the jingle on the door, his keen ears never miss a
sound and he looks over seeing ~
Victor A Martel: 	Evan entering he nods respectfully::
Evn Walker: 	he brushes across the floor, his boots almost gliding as he
moves towards Vic and Lexi.  A 
Evn Walker: 	single dip of his head is given during the approach:: (s)
Morning.
LexMartel: 	::stopping,heturns and bows respectfully to Evan,low to denote
his station~
LexMartel: 	and respectful position as gamma to his alpha::
Victor A Martel: 	How are you this morning Evan?
Evn Walker: 	(s) Still alive.  ::His face void of any true emotions right
now.  Lips forming a straigh 
Evn Walker: 	line, eyes hidden, arms hanging at his side:: (s) You?
Victor A Martel: 	Anything wrong?  I'm alright... Lex... stand up.
Victor A Martel: 	::looking at Lex with that... "he's taking this far too
seriously" look::
Evn Walker: 	(s) Wrong, maybe.  ::Frowning as he glances to Lexi his head
tilts slightly to the side, 
LexMartel: 	::nodding to Victor he stands gracefully and smoothly,the
movements lithe and nimble~
Evn Walker: 	his knowledge of asian customs such as bowing is lacking...is a
punk like that::
Victor A Martel: 	What's up?
LexMartel: 	he smiles;amber eyes twinkle::
Evn Walker: 	(s) Hmm, where to start.  ::Lifting his right arm he digs his
fingers into his hair, 
Evn Walker: 	massaging at the scalp, hair falling just past his shoulders
about six inches, no longer the
Evn Walker: 	waist length it used to be:: (s) Damian threatened Aton for
hitting one of his 'packmates' -
Evn Walker: 	he things he has the right to come against what's mine.  Told me
if it happens again he'll 
Evn Walker: 	put a silver slug in his head.  ::Frowning at that thought,
along with the headache slowly 
Evn Walker: 	increasing::
Victor A Martel: 	Yeah, Damian's a disrespectful punk like that... calls me a
pup, trys to bully his way ~
LexMartel: 	::Pales slightly at this news and listens intently to him;eyes
showing his concern::
Victor A Martel: 	around with everyone... and beats wome.
Victor A Martel: 	(Women)
Evn Walker: 	::Frowning slightly more he nods and allows the pain to his him
full force as he cringes:: 
Evn Walker: 	(s) If he touched or threatens mine again I'm going to deal with
things.  I am not worried 
Evn Walker: 	about losing a deputy on the force.  I'm handing in my badge and
sidearm later today when I 
Evn Walker: 	go in to see Jason.  
Victor A Martel: 	::blinks:: Well, I can't say that it upsets me... but we
need to go on with what we talked ~
Victor A Martel: 	about.  Dealing with Damian.  I have the perfect solution.
Evn Walker: 	(s) That so?  Whatcha come up with?  ::Lowering his arm back to
his side he allows the pain 
Evn Walker: 	to die down once again as he makes a note to stop moving his
head::
Victor A Martel: 	::looks at Lex:: go hit the auto locks on the doors will
you?  You need some pain meds dude?
LexMartel: 	::listening to the two of them,he heads out to follow Victors
reques and to get a small med~
LexMartel: 	kit with painkillers and a bottle of water::
Evn Walker: 	(s) No, I just need to smack Roland upside the head and tear out
some chic's throat for 
Evn Walker: 	getting in my face tonight... ::Grumbling at the flashback of
the little scene tonight in 
Evn Walker: 	the Symp:: (s) Eh, get this one too.  Roland's started
threatening what's mine to.  He -
Evn Walker: 	doesn't like Omsford Investigation and was going to kill Seth
until I stepped in.
Victor A Martel: 	::chuckles:: I thought you mellowed... <g>  Alright, here
is the plan...  I don't like OI ~
LexMartel: 	::walking out and arming the security system and getting a few
things on a tray he returns ~
LexMartel: 	nodding to Vic that he is done::
Victor A Martel: 	either... he's moving in on my turf... and I won't allow
that... won't hurt him, but i will~
Victor A Martel: 	shut him down...  Sasha told me about the hunt on Aton...
well we can alter it a bit.
Evn Walker: 	::Frowning slowly, disgusted with himself that he even thought
of hunting one of his own, no
Evn Walker: 	matter how much Aton had deserved it then:: (s) Yeah?  Go on.
Victor A Martel: 	Well, ,Aton does need a lesson... so... we allow him to
keep the wolf, and tell him that if~
Victor A Martel: 	he can fight off the offenders, he has proven his worth...
Damian wants to be there for it~
Victor A Martel: 	and I say we allow him to...  The rest of the Guardians and
Warders will be hidden while ~
LexMartel: 	::listens,having his own opinions and keeping them and his own
council to himself::
Victor A Martel: 	this takes place... then someone who shoots damn nicely,
can pop Deputy D in the noggin and~
Victor A Martel: 	the rest of us tear him to shreds including Aton... all out
in the the wild, all wolf ~
Victor A Martel: 	justice... I will take care of things with Rya... but I
don't think there will be a problem.
Evn Walker: 	(s) Hmm... Damian likes Godshead.  He thinks he's safe there.
And out of all of us, I -
Victor A Martel: 	Damian won't fight on Godshead... he views it as "holy
ground" and sacred.
Evn Walker: 	prolly have the past aim... Vic, you know how a hunt is done?
Evn Walker: 	(best not past)
Victor A Martel: 	Not according to your ways... but I know how I handle
matters...
Evn Walker: 	::Nodding his head slowly, waves of pain hit but he shoves them
aside for now...he'll cry 
Evn Walker: 	later:: (s) The Warders come together at the homestead.  Aton
would come before me and my 
Evn Walker: 	Lupa, Sasha.  The rest of mine would take to their natural form
::Has this thing where he 
Evn Walker: 	thinks the wolf is the natural form...when it really isn't as
most are born human:: And line
Evn Walker: 	up according to rank.  Geri to left, Freki to the Lupa's right.
Skoll and Hati... in this 
Evn Walker: 	case my Skoll is Aton... would sit before me.  Only the Lupa,
Ulfric and the hunted keep 
LexMartel: 	::Listens,not quite sre of the ranking system,but can always ask
about it later::
Evn Walker: 	their true form.  -All- the Warders will be there and accounted
for or they will be next to 
Evn Walker: 	come before the court.  
Evn Walker: 	(<thinks that's right.  It's set up like a chess board
really...>)
Evn Walker: 	(<needs to go play chess to be sure>)
Victor A Martel: 	::Raises a brow:: All that to tell him he's about to die?
How do I fit into that? 
Evn Walker: 	(s) The Ulfric has the right to call in two -advisors- non pack
related to assist in the 
Evn Walker: 	hunt.  The reason for this is should the pack feel guilty about
killing another pack the two
Evn Walker: 	advisors bring in outside pack thoughts for the judgement.
Before the hunt itself starts 
Victor A Martel: 	Alright... here's a better plan... Damian doesn't know your
way... make up something new~
Evn Walker: 	Aton presents his case against the court.
Victor A Martel: 	because this is about testing Aton, and kililng Damian...
Evn Walker: 	(Bah!  to...not against...)
Victor A Martel: 	(Killing)
Evn Walker: 	(s) And it will work.  You as one advisor, Damian as another...
I will teach him my way.  
Victor A Martel: 	But I want the rest of the guardians there as well...  This
is for all of us.
Evn Walker: 	When the hunt begins all that participate must take their wolf
form.  I must keep my human 
Evn Walker: 	form the whole time and can not participate.
Victor A Martel: 	To save all of us... Damian is a threat to us all, he is
far too much of a wildcard.
Evn Walker: 	(s) This is my homestead, There are pleny of places for the
Gaurdian to be.
Victor A Martel: 	How do you mean your homestead?
Evn Walker: 	(s) They can come to the court too... they just can't hunt...
Victor A Martel: 	We aren't out for Aton..  we are out for Damian, and we
will get him.
Evn Walker: 	(s) The Warders clearing, the home where we all come to.  -Our-
land in Voletta.
Evn Walker: 	(s) I know, I'm telling you the pack's protcall, in it we will
use it against Damian.
Victor A Martel: 	Using your court you are breaking your rule, Aton is the
criminal, and we are after Damian..
Victor A Martel: 	So this is all show for Damian?
Evn Walker: 	(s) Am I breaking my rule?  Did Damian not come against my pack?
The court is for Aton to 
Evn Walker: 	teach him a lesson.  But it will be used to make judgement
Damian.  My court does not hold 
Evn Walker: 	jurisdiction with other packs.  Damian does not deserve to come
before me in a fair manner, 
Evn Walker: 	he is not mine.  You hunt yours, your way, his pack hunts their
way, and I hunt mine.  
Evn Walker: 	(on Damian...god I can not type)
Victor A Martel: 	Whatever the method, as long as he is dead I'm happy...
I'll wear a bunny suit if needed...~
Victor A Martel: 	but I will tell you one thing...  I won't be in wolf
form...
Evn Walker: 	(s) No need, only mine have to be, before the hunt on Aton.  The
advisors don't until the 
Evn Walker: 	hunt if they wish to participate in it.  They can back out of
the hunt and watch.  And that 
Evn Walker: 	is what you can do.  I know Damian will go for the hunt, or, he
will play unjust and pull a 
Evn Walker: 	gun on Aton, either way...
Victor A Martel: 	Actually I most likely won't be the advisor... we will wait
away from the group in the ~
Victor A Martel: 	Cloak of the Wolf... when you shoot we will diverg on our
hunted... our way.
LexMartel: 	::watching and listening,wishing to learn more of
this;attentively he watches.Eyes moving ~
LexMartel: 	back and forth watching them::
Victor A Martel: 	(diverge)
Evn Walker: 	(s) Would you suggest one of yours to be an advisor?  I would
ask Syn, but I don't think she
Evn Walker: 	likes my form of rule.  She's not who she once was...
Victor A Martel: 	Syn stays out of this...she wants to dance around with
fangers and that nonsense she can, ~
Victor A Martel: 	but I don't see her helping our kind so I don't include her
with our kind.  As far as me, I~
Victor A Martel: 	will wait in the clearing to bring Justice upon Damian in
my lines warrior form.  I will ~
Victor A Martel: 	bring him down with my forefathers hammer... he will be
judged.
Victor A Martel: 	Since I now have total control over the beast inside...
Evn Walker: 	::Blinking a few times at this comment he tilts his head to the
side, the frown once more 
Evn Walker: 	forming on his face as the thought of his lack of control as of
late rises to the surface 
Evn Walker: 	again.  Every full moon since Syn brought the wolf back he has
ended up on the ground in a 
Evn Walker: 	crumpled fetal position fighting for control of the beast:: (s)
How?
Victor A Martel: 	You are an Alpha, you should know by now...  The beast
isn't all controlling... we gain ~
Victor A Martel: 	strength from our family to fight the beast and use it as
we should...  like this...
Victor A Martel: 	##Horus Mastery## (Auto)
Evn Walker: 	(s) I can call it, but it controls me now, as much as it did
before.  I had kept it at bay 
Victor A Martel: 	##Horus##
Victor A Martel: 	::Rises into the Winter Wolf Straining out of the clothing
he wore and rising above Evan, ~
Victor A Martel: 	green eyes look down on him with calm clarity::
Evn Walker: 	for a long time, but with Syn bringing me back It takes me just
as it did when I first... 
Victor A Martel: 	(Get rid of the second Horus, Horus Mastery takes you
there)
Evn Walker: 	::Freezing and blinking.  His body tensing, hands swinging
forward to block a hit:: (s) What
Evn Walker: 	the...
Victor A Martel: 	>>::Evan:: Use the Strength that Luna gave you...<<
Victor A Martel: 	::His mind rings into Evan in perfect clarity and lucidity
deep and quiet, calming even::
LexMartel: 	::Watches almost sagely,he its yoga style in a manner making one
pause to think if the posi~
Evn Walker: 	(s) There is no strength there for me, I've felt like a pup when
it comes to control... That
LexMartel: 	tion he takes is quite natural or how he can possibly be in it::
Evn Walker: 	whatever you do to keep it at bay, I can't...
Evn Walker: 	(s) You are the better Alpha... ::That said with all honesty as
he looks up, head tilted 
Evn Walker: 	back as he slips off his shades.  A tear rolling out of the
corner of his eye as he thinks 
Evn Walker: 	back on the pup known as Victor and now he sees this...yes, Evan
is getting emotinall over 
Evn Walker: 	Vic being all grown up now...::
Evn Walker: 	(Can't....spel..)
Evn Walker: 	(Spell!)
Victor A Martel: 	I guess you now learn from pup become alpha, and you gain
control... ::the voice spitting ~
Victor A Martel: 	and gutteral as he reaches out and catches the tear on a
talon and slices his palm deeply ~
Victor A Martel: 	with the tear stained claw:: Brothers.. sealed in blood..
sealed with your ways... families~
Victor A Martel: 	eternal... 
Victor A Martel: 	::Holds the taloned hand out to him, blood dripping across
the white pads::
Evn Walker: 	::Nodding his head slowly, a faint smile forming over the
previously frowning lips.  He 
Evn Walker: 	takes his right arm, his strongest and most required as it's his
shooting arm, and extends 
Evn Walker: 	his hand, fingers outstretched to Vic, palm up::
Victor A Martel: 	::Rakes the tear and blood covered talon lightly over Evans
palm, enough to bleed and feel ~
LexMartel: 	::Somewhat touched at the display before him,though also not
quite feeling he belongs here::
Victor A Martel: 	then brings the two together his Massive hands covering his
and clasping together as they ~
Victor A Martel: 	seal and the blood mingles, the tight grip holding most of
the blood inside::
Victor A Martel: 	Brothers...  ::nods then turns his palm over cupping it
with the blood, holding it in his ~
Victor A Martel: 	palm:: Now I make blood gem to add to the hammer...  make
it complete.
Evn Walker: 	(s) Brothers.  ::Nodding his head slowly he pulls his arm back,
palm facing up.  He brings 
Evn Walker: 	it to his mouth, and laps at it.  Cleaning away the blood away
to allow the wound to heal 
Evn Walker: 	faster with the healing agents in his saliva::
Evn Walker: 	(Saw it in a book!  Don't think I'm corny or nothing...OK...so I
am <g>)
Victor A Martel: 	::Will lap a bit to seal it farther but will shortly
thereafter  step back to the temple ~
Victor A Martel: 	and pull a crystalline cube off a shelf there, opening the
lid and bleeding into it until ~
Victor A Martel: 	it't coloring becomes hued with deep red::
Evn Walker: 	::Watching as Victor moves off he closes his fingers around his
palm and forms a fist, 
Evn Walker: 	allowing the blood to rush back to the cut to scab over until
the wound vanished.  Dropping 
LexMartel: 	::Watches,and adds a bit more knowledge to what he has learned
and hopes to someday~
LexMartel: 	prove worthy of the great honor he has been allowed to witness
this scared pact::
Evn Walker: 	to his knees now he presses his head against the matts.  The
pain now browing to an 
Evn Walker: 	unbearable limit, having kept it in all that time::
Evn Walker: 	(growing)
Victor A Martel: 	::Pushes on a section of wall and pulls open a secret
section, and from within he removes ~
Victor A Martel: 	a very large red velvet covered item... about 4 feet long
and nearly T shapped::
Evn Walker: 	::Eyelids slip shut as he remains, bowing to nothing and
everything as his head lies against
Evn Walker: 	the semi-soft surface of the matts.  Small words are mumbled as
he slows his breathing to 
Evn Walker: 	pull the pain in his head back undercontrol.::
Victor A Martel: 	::Makes his way back to Evan... the item clasped in one
huge fist and the Velvet falling ~
Victor A Martel: 	away with the swing of his stride.  What is revealed is the
head of a large silver wolf..~
Victor A Martel: 	the mouth wide and the head of a huge warhammer protruding
from it, the opposite end bears ~
Victor A Martel: 	a spike that is formed from the wolf's mane and trails into
a spike::
Evn Walker: 	::Lifting his head as the sounds of movement nearing is heard
once more he throws the pain  
Evn Walker: 	back and straightens his back, kneeling now on the ground.
Slipping out the shades he slips
Evn Walker: 	them on to once more cover his eyes::
LexMartel: 	::Watching in silence and reverance,the scene unfolding before
him::
Evn Walker: 	(out=on)
Victor A Martel: 	::Places the sharpened but of the haft onto the floor and
rests his hand across the top, ~
Victor A Martel: 	white furred fingers running across the textures in the
wolfs fur.  He reaches out to help ~
Victor A Martel: 	Evan to stand holding a hand out to him, not removing his
dignity by hoisting him up::
Evn Walker: 	::Accepting the hand and the aid he rises slowly, pushing forth
the faint hint a smile, the 
Evn Walker: 	most he can form when all his body wants to do is shrink into
nothing::
Victor A Martel: 	You go home and Rest....  you need sleep...  we work on
control later.  We kill Damian.
Victor A Martel: 	::The wolven face winks and smiles, teeth baring::

moving is hardly noticeable he

starts for the door::

around<<
