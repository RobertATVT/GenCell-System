	Torn...<BR>
<BR>
	He was torn in his struggle to fend of the hateful urges that drove him to kill.  A contsant battle, his path leading him down the dark hateful road that overcame his pupil, a path shown to er by Damian Knight.  He didn't want to become like Damian, a cop that used his position to hunt those that he felt were evil, but that evil turns on itself and eventually he would become a desparate abomination.  Vic had a family though, a family that he swore he would die to protect or avenge... he'd been striving to turn over his life.  But then came a rapist, then came Noah.<BR>
<BR>
	Hatred....<BR>
<BR>
	He wanted to do nothing more than flay Noah alive, pull his flesh from his body in small strips until the man passed out from shock and pain.  Then the process would begin again, and again, and again... a neverending saga of misery.  Those thoughts and feelings had begun to overshadow any others that he felt.  Love, caring, morality...  all playing second fiddle to his hatred.<BR>
<BR>
	Preperation.....<BR>
<BR>
	He began to gather his things together, apparently the desire for good had lost this battle, it was time to hunt.  His pistols had been cleaned, loaded, and slipped into his holsters.  He had two extra clips with Silver bullets, just in case someone of his kind interfered and needed to be put down.  <BR>
<BR>
	He pulled out his hunter-pack and checked over the contents...<BR>
		Three wooden stakes - 1.25 inches diameter, 10 inches long.<BR>
		Crucifix<BR>
		Holy Water - Though not charged with the proper rights<BR>
		Bane Water - Charged and ready<BR>
		Wolfsbane - smelly garbage that it is<BR>
		Cold Iron Daggers - though he's not sure what those are for.<BR>
<BR>
	The hunter-pack was looked over to make sure that everything was secure, then rolled up and set aside on his couch.  Once rolled it made into a nice little shoulder sling and would stay out of the way unless needed.  Now for his miscellaneous supplies.<BR>
<BR>
	He had gone out and purchased a wetsuit to keep skin and hair from falling in combat, this particular one specially made for his size.  He had one in the works that was fitted in certain areas with lycra strips that would stretch as his body shifted to his half wolf form.  Unfortunately, that one had not arrived yet.  He threw the diving mask that went with the suit over on top of the wetsuit as well as the footies and gloves.  Suit taken care of especially after having the face refitted with a winter mask covering that has only slits around the mouth and nose to allow for breathing and holes for the eyes.  That should do nicely.<BR>
<BR>
	He pulled out the two sprayer tanks, you know the kind used to spray weed killer and bug repellant, large 2 gallon tanks with a pump on the top that builds pressure and a small hose that you spray with... those are perfect for his needs.  One filled with bleach, the one thing that contaminates any source of DNA so bad that it can't be used... doesn't work for hair samples per se... but the second sprayer is for that.  Filled with gasoline it is, one spray of the bleach and you got DNA destroyed, second spray with gasoline and a little match... no evidence at all... the gloves taking care of any fingerprints that could be left.<BR>
<BR>
	Everything was set, road flares, matches, and other small flammable items set into various pouches and packets as well.  Now it was just time to pick targets... he had a list that was given to him by someone a long time ago... all Vampires.  Noah and Sekmeht would be far too visible at this juncture, seeing that Ceile was just raped and the case hadn't gone to trial yet... but they are top priority and soon would be dealt with... so he looked further down the list to the next group of names... Mr and Mrs Keller... sure thing, he had their address and all, just a matter of driving there and extinguishing two formerly living flames.  All in a days work.</I></FONT></HTML>
