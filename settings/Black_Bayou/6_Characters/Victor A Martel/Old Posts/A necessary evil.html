Another day another dollar, that's what they say anyway.  Have you ever spent ten hours a day, for weeks, watching people on security monitors?  I didn't figure, but let me say this...  you will never have need to watch television ever again.  Hundreds of tiny crimes pass right by your eyes every day.  For instance, Jarred Whittington, that nice and clean cut lab assistant in the medical wing.  Well, I have noticed that he pockets two or three pain killers every third trip to the medicines.  Then over at the clinic you have pretty Ms. Johnson... she likes forceps, and her boyfriend has stolen enough first aid supplies to medic Vietnam solo.  <BR>

	Seems that we also have a little cabal in Accounting that thinks they are wizards of embezzling.  They set up a way that the can syphon fractions of a cent off of all Fairlight transactions.  Each one individually won't be noticed, but with all the mass transactions they add up.  Well, they have been transferring these leftovers to a separate account and it has been working like a charm.  Last I heard him and his little crew of miscreant geniuses talking, they had another three months to go before their great early retirement.  I guess I will wait till the last minute, let the idiots get to where they feel the warmth from the light at the end of the tunnel, then I will collapse that tunnel on them and crush them.  Evil met in kind.  <BR>

	Ms. Johnson and her beau I will put raw fear into.  I will send a security detail to gather them up, right while they are working so that people know something is amiss, and drag them to my "interview" room.  I will have a pleasant chat with them... After the talk I will bet my years salary that they quit within the week.<BR>
<BR>
	Mr. Whittington is easy, I will give an anonymous tip to the police about someone trafficking pain killers and pharmaceutical grade drugs.  Let the pigs deal with that one.  Every one of these crimes is though unnoticed, that they can do it over and over again cause they didn't get busted the first time so they beat the system.  Like hell, I catch almost every one of them.  But these are nothing compared to one that has recently caught my attention.  Seems that a member of upper management is using their position, pay raises and job security as a dating, or mating rather, service.  People like that are the worst scum I can imagine.  Evil is evil, but when a person extorts or outright takes something so precious as the human body or soul ::grits teeth tightly:: that is the lowest.  Tampering with objects unliving and stealing them only hurts the wallet, that can be overcome, but when you take a part of the human soul or psyche and twist or crush it, well that's a sin that can never be forgiven.  For that crime I can think of  only one way to punish.  I can see an unfortunately fatal accident in someone's future.<BR>

	Yeah Yeah, I know what you're thinking.  "Is murder any better?".  No.  It isn't better at all.  There is another saying "evil is as evil does" or some such rubbish.  I never claimed to be a flower child tree hugging free love nice guy.  Well, I have no compassion or sympathy for someone who would rape, and abuse another human being.  I think that those who are stronger shouldn't use their might to hurt people who are weak and unable to defend themselves.  Those of us who are capable should guard over and protect those that are powerless.  Yeah, just give me tights and a cape... right?  What is it all for you ask?  So that I can give my children a chance to grow up in safety, and provide for them the best I can.  To care for my lovely wife and children.  Do you honestly think that all monsters are all bad?  Do you think that a heartless killer has no emotions?  Like I give a damn what you think, this isn't about you.  Unless you are one of the pathetic whelps that I catch on the monitors.  Unless you are one of the slimy rapists and corrupters that need to be put down.  In that event, don't expect mercy... don't expect me to have a sudden change of heart and give you a second chance at life.  For your kind there is one chance only.  I already have my eye on a few of you, soon paybacks will come a calling...  he has fangs and claws, and a family that howls by his side. </HTML>
