Funny how we know that every one of us will die eventually, but for some reason the death of our parents is so unseen.  They get sick, they age, and all the while the seem like immortals to us.  My father was a good man, and I can't help but think that I helped him to his early rest.  You see, I have treated my family extremely poorly in<BR>
the last ten years.  After the death of Suzette when I was seventeen I left home without as much as a word.  For the following ten years I wandered across Eastern Europe and Asia alone and without a word to my family.  The only connection I had was an unsigned postcard from the newest location that I happened to land in.  My grief urged me to hide from anything that could ease the suffering that I believed that I had caused.  You see, not only was<BR>
she killed by one of my kind, somehow the beast who had done it forced the images into my mind as I slept that night.  For ten years I ran from myself, and in doing so I had caused my only connection of blood nothing but pure trauma.  I know, who would have thought that I would do such a thing?  Well, I did.<BR>
<BR>
	After reaching Voletta I had fallen in and out of love, one person being at the deepest reaches of my mind.  Suzette.  When I met Skye Heart I was overjoyed in thinking that somehow I had found her again, my lost love.  But hey, we all have our delusions don't we?  Time went on and I called my family for the first time in what seemed like an eternity.  It was like I was calling across time and speaking to members of a past life.  They were overjoyed<BR>
to hear my voice, having always wondered what kind of man their son grew to be.  Mother cried from the moment she answered the phone until the morning when the exhaustion of her joy and disbelief had drained her.  My father stern as always was happy to hear from me and began immediate plans to see me, coming to this new home I had found across the Atlantic.  Since that time I have kept in constant vigil with my family, swearing not to be separated<BR>
from them again.  Later my cousin which I had not laid eyes on since I was a mere child came searching for me and began his own life here, I will not lose him.  I will make him as strong as myself, carrying my spirit and my wolf inside of him.  Never again will my family be torn asunder.<BR>
<BR>
	Now it comes around that my father died peacefully in the night, having spent a few days in unusual pain.  I guess all he had ever wanted was complete now, his son returned, his family well taken care of, his heart healed...  Only to break in the middle of the night.  And I missed him terribly.  My father was a great man, he lived his life for his family and upheld over a thousand years of tradition.  My father, now dead, now lost to me again.  I<BR>
can't help but think that I shortened his rich full life with my careless and selfish act of stupidity.  I will learn for sure when I'm dead ... whenever that happens. <BR>
<BR>
	I have begun a new family now, one that will never be parted save by death.  I have a daughter and I will forever keep vigil over her and soon I will have more children.  I will use the curse that killed my Suzette to bear forth our lost pups after all, she will be their mother in spirit and I in the flesh.  Recently I found that I will have a grandchild, that has me in a state of bliss.  My life is coming around to bear and for once I am content<BR>
with who I am, what I have become, and what I have started.  Now someone has dared to defile all that I hold dear.  Just this morning I received a call from my frantic mother, she informed me that someone had the daring to burst into my fathers tomb and strip the valuables from its shadowed depths.  The marble bust of my father that is steeped in tradition from the late 1200s was stolen as was the body of my father.  The thieves had scrawled paint<BR>
across the outside and broken the stone lid to his resting place.  Now it is on.  My life is happy now, my existence has meaning and bearing.  I am at peace and woe be brought upon anyone who tries to bring that asunder, for the house of Martel leaves no witness.<BR>
