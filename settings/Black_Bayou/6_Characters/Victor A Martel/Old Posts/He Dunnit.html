The soft glow of the incinerator cast macabre shadows around the man's massive silhouette.  His form stood menacingly in front of Alicia as she lay sprawled upon the worn and weathered recliner just a few feet before him.  <BR>
<BR>
"So Ali?  Are you ready to take full responsibility for your actions?" <BR>
<BR>
"If it will stop a war... aye."  Tears streamed down her beaten and battered face.  Red rimmed and swollen eyes peered up into the eyes of her Killer..  <I>If it will stop a war.....</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>

<I>"Tha Fortea's own me."  Split and bloodied lips had parted to speak, yet the beating she had taken from his hands made it difficult for her to talk. "I"m their ghoul.. their family ghoul...."   </I><BR>
<BR>
Echoes of her confessions still rang in his ears as the Killer stepped up to the recliner. With ease he pulled her broken body up. Her bloodied shirt ripped at the shoulder seams as he drug her toward the heated flames of the incinerator fire.  He inched Alicia closer to the tendrils of flames that flickered back and forth. "-That- will clean the sickness.  Maybe when you finally heal you will be freed? All their poison burned from you."<BR>
<BR>
Alicia cringed away from the intense heat.  Her pale blue orbs rolled back into their swollen sockets.  She steeled herself against the attempt to flee. He had beaten her in combat under the laws of a Wolves Challenge.  It was his right to take her life.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<BR>
Guilt flared in the killers eyes for a momentand with a rough throw he  tossed her away from the heat of the flames and sent her flying across the concrete of the floor.  The cleansing death of the fires would not be done by his hand.  He would not kill her, no... she must live with the consequences of her own choices.  The Killer clenched his teeth as he turned to face the fetal lump at his feet. " Leave our kind Ali..."  She needed to be sent away, away from our kind forever.<BR>
<BR>
Confusion over took her, she had expected the singe of flame not the hard thump of the deathly cold floor. Her voice was but a mere whisper, " Do ye think I asked ta be theirs?  Do ye think I had any choice?"  Alicia raised up on a bloodied elbow and peered up into the eyes of her Killer, her voice gaining strength. " Do you think I liked it when the leaches wouldn't stay away from yer fiance? For one <tosing> minute, do ye think me heart dinna stop when Jade said that yer lover would be one of tha first ta die if it comes ta War?!"<BR>
<BR>
The Killer starred down at her.  The muscles in his neck grew taunt.  His nose snarled up as he all rational thought fled his mind.  The Killers body convulsed as millions of tiny hairs erupted from his flesh.  His head stretched into that of a large wolf, the elongated skull looked out of place until the rest of the body popped and snapped into the completed change of the Horus Beast. <BR>
<BR>
Alicia eyes widened.  Never before had she ever witnessed such a monstrosity as the being that now towered over her.  Her slack jawed gaze could not comprehend the Power that held her life so precariously in the balance.  She could only but register the fact that the Horus before her was not the slavering Beast of Rage that he should be, but instead ~ a cold, calculating, -thinking- Monster of Death. <BR>
<BR>
Her mind snapped.  Sanity lost.  Shock quickly settled in as his clawed talon reached down and plucked her up from the floor by her face with a controlled ease.  In one simple motion, he flung her battered frame into the open mouth of the incinerator.  In one smooth stride, he stepped over and slammed the metal door shut with a resounding -clang-.<BR>
<BR>
*****<BR>
<BR>
With calculated motions he removed the body from the deathly flames of the fire.  The Killer slung the burning corpse down on the floor as tendrils of burnt skin and hair filled the room.  Perhaps it was just his overactive imagination, maybe even his conscience? Whichever it was, the howls of pain from within the fiery pit haunted him even in the now eerie silence of the basement.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next hour, the Killer went thru the monotonous steps of getting rid of the corpse.  He had murdered before, slaughtered dozens with the might of his bare hands.  Yet this time... this time he had killed a woman who had once been his lover.  Sometime during  the sixty minutes he spent looking at her crisped body, a little piece of his soul died.  A part of his heart hardened.  And the seed of justice grew within his mind. <BR>

Victor Martel found himself standing on a hillside overlooking the burning remains of Alica's Jaguar.  He had placed her burnt corpse behind the drivers wheel of the sports car, wedged her foot on the accelerator, then watch the car plummet off the edge of the unused road.  <BR>
<BR>
He stood there, trenchcoat flapping in the breeze that rolled inland from the distant ocean.  The muscles in his jaw clenched and unclenched as the acrid smell of burning metal and rubber filled his senses.  "With the Pheonix there comes a cleansing.  With your awakening there will  come safety."    There was a new coldness in the depths of Victor's emerald eyes as he slipped a pair of ebony black sunglasses on and turned away from the blaze.  "If your rebirth fails Alica,  then be prepared for me to  send you back into the cycle to start anew."<BR>
