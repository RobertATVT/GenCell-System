	Some say that angels float from the skies on large irradescent feathered wings.  They say that they are covered in the shimmering light of love.  I'm here to tell you that angels have many faces, and some angels aren't pretty.  A lot of things where revealed to me tonight.  Started off as another of my crusades of justice, maybe not by your standards... but we already covered just what I think of "your" standards.  Enough retrospect, allow me to paint for you what I am bantering about.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	It was kinda chilly tonight, well...  as compared to normal.  There was another house to my back, this one was the american dream.  Father and Mother, two kids, a pet dog, nice white fence, and two cars.  This was a complete family, happy and loving.  At least on the outside.  The inside crawled with a darkness that light could not send away and it seems that a little girls prayers couldn't correct.  That little girl is the reason I am here.  As I sit here and wait I can hear her voice upstairs, her whispered prayers carried through the calm still night and gathered by my overly keen ears.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Please let that mean bully johnny not try and take my snack cakes at school...  and lord... <vvvvqw> please send an angel to take daddy away so he will stop hurting me."<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	I wonder how many times she has said that prayer?  Afraid to tell mommy cause daddy told her that she was a bad girl?  I heard him in the hospital, telling her that if she was better behaved or got better grades that he would stop.  It as all I could do to keep from tossing my lunch, her pitiful cries carried in my head, her shakey voice saying that same ending to her prayer haunted me, and now I hear it again.  It brings back other memories with it... other things haunting me.  My first service of justice.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	There was a roar in my ears as my mind carried me into memory, the roar of flames and then the sounds.  Popping, cracking, seering whistles as her flesh was being devoured by flames.  Was that her screaming Javins name or was it the air being ripped from her lungs as the fire consumed everything it touched and yearned for more.  I did it for my family, for the web that Alicia had woven us into put us all in danger and at risk.  Especially my Ceile, my one true love and desire.  I couldn't let anything hurt her, I have lost someone before and I swore that I would never live through that pain ever again.  Not over this tramp, this vampire licking harlot.  I knew it wouldn't kill her... she needed purged, cleansed, nothing more.  The pain that she felt a reminder of what her actions would bring to others, how she nearly brought her loved ones into a war that would ultimately spell the demise of my family and the woman I loved would likely be the first to fall.  Not this time.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Damn... my mind got a bit carried away again...  I hate it when that happens.  One quick look told me that only a few minutes went by, which was all I needed.  Pops left his window open in his study as usual.  Good.  A quick jump and I was perched on the window sill, watching him as he looked around.  Confusion was written on his face plainly, then as I suspected he stood up and slowly pulled a bit of bravery from somewhere in his whicked shell.  He made his way to the window to see what that loud noise was.  Little did he know that his very own Angel of Death sat waiting.  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Cause there’s a monster living under my bed<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	"Are you ready to know fear little man?"  My voice whispered out of nothingness as I dropped the mystic concealment that I had wrapped around myself.  His eyes widened in terror as the shroud melted from my body leaving the huge black clad figure to perch in the window.  Whicked green eyes and hair white as snow, the scars covering my face glared like fiber-optic spiderwebs.  With a speedy lunge I was on him before he could gather his thoughts to let out a noise.  Like a panther springing on it's prey I left the perch and barely touched the ground when my hand grabbed him by the jaw.  My mind slithered out to touch his, the touch almost feeling dirty to me... but I wanted quiet.  I didn't want the child to awaken in the night to witness this.  <BR>

	"You may be wondering why I am here, thoughts of robbery, or other ignorant pastimes are probably your first assumptions.  However, let me assure you that I am not here to take anything from you other than that which you have lost the right to possess.  Your life.  In my own vision I have seen the evidence of your corrupt evil, an evil that no confessional can lay to rest.  An evil that has not only destroyed your soul, but possibly the soul of a beautiful child.  I pray that she recovers from your disgusting touch, that the seed of your loathing filth will be washed from her.  For your sins there is but one penalty.  Death."  <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>There’s a darkness deep in my soul<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	My mind realed in the clarity of my words, like I was no longer in control.  His eyes showed remorse, the shred of a conscience, but it was far too late.  I came here to do what our society is afraid to do, to bring true justice without worry of ramifications, without counter suits and appeals.  This man will never be heard from again, he will vanish into the night with his killer, and a childs heart will be set free.  There is another prayer in this house tonight, this one I am not here to answer.  This one is rejected, nothing can save him now...  he is in my hands.  And those hands clasp against his soft flesh, holding him out at arms length, feet dangling above the floor.  Pictures of the child are strewn across his desk.  How could this man sit and look at the pictures of someone he had crushed spiritually?  What kind of sickness would allow a man to surround himself with images of his crime like nothing was wrong?  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	The hatred that flooded my body wracked my mind with memories.  Memories of the fire, her body as I sunk the hook into it to drag her out.  The short time I threw her in hadn't killed her, but all that was left was nothing more than a glob of melting charred flesh.  Nobody would understand my reasons, no court would sympathize nor understand the motives behin it all.  Ceile will hate me and I am sure that I will lose her.  I do what I do for them though, I do these things for my family.  To keep them safe, even though I am the one that gave them this tag of hatred.  I am the one that essentially threw them all into peril.  My curse, is my guilt.  Now it has to be done, they are here and they are now, and I cannot undo what I have done to them.  So I take these lives, to keep others from harm, to make amends.  These are my hail mary's, this is my confession.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	His throat is gurgling out pleas for help, that liars tongue that put guilt into the heart and mind of his own child.  Her picture is taken in my hand with a swipe, there she sits in a little christmas dress, covered in bows and frill.  She is a pretty girl, her face is innocent, like a childs face should be.  Her eyes scream for help though, haunted little eyes that hold within them a secret to horrible to share.  A quick pres of my thumb breaks the glass quietly against the desk and the fragments of glass and her little picture are scooped in my hand...  shattered like the life her father has given her.  It's now time to eat that life... to let that sin end her pain and suffering.  Then the creature is fed, through bulging red rimmed eyes he screams.  The peices of glass and paper shoved into his mouth, cutting as they go.  Once again my mind reaches to his "Eat".<BR>
<BR>
	The feast of sinners didn't last long.  He chewed and began to swallow, the glass shredding everything as it passsed down his throat washed down with his own blood.  Minutes and he was dead.  Silent and internal... the only problem was the blood that would gout from his mouth when I dropped him to the floor.  A good heavy duty garbage bag would fix all that... didn't have to worry about him suffocating now did I?  The body would be set next to the window, all in waiting for my return.  There was just one more thing I had to do.<BR>

	Silent footsteps carry me... soft footfalls of a hunter.  The only difference is that for once, there was no prey.  Her door was covered in cartoon characters and was very befitting a child her age.  So young, so fragile, so undeserving of this torment.  The door barely made a noise when it was opened, the light from a nearby streetlight gave a dim glow to the room when I peered inside.  She laid there amidst a tangled mess of covers, she must have been tossing and turning from nightmares.  Poor thing.  I made my way to her bedside, stepping over the toys that littered the floor in small heaps and covered her up, placing her teddy bear close to her side and brushing her hair from her sweat covered brow.  With a quiet click a dull yellow light beamed to cover the room in it's warm assuring light, the safety of a childs night light filled the room.  I dared another look back at her, I will see her again... I will make sure that she is forever safe.  A trickle of my mind seeks her out in her sleep, a few words that I cannot keep myself from.<BR>
