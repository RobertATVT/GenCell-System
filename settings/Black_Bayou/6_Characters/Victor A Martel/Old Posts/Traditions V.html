	His mind burst open as he awoke from the odd slumber,  his dreams were torn with memories of his past.  He sat up and held onto his face for a few moments, Marie was right but should he expect anything less?  He heaved a sigh and looked around the small den that was given to him, dirt, plants, more dirt, and wood.  Not exactly a resort anymore.  He heard a bit of commotion from outside and gathered himself to stand up.  he was surprised again as Marie's voice purred out of the dark night air to meet his ears.<BR>
	"Are you ready to hunt pup?"  Her voice was full of vigor and jest, he could feel the energy in the air as the conclave stirred.  "You know that I want you on the hunt don't you?  I want you to get used to our justice Victor, you will hold part of every facet of our society.  You will learn all of it, but tonight you learn how we deal with strays."<BR>
	He stepped out of the den and looked at her, her eyes almost sparkled in the night air, framed by the smooth strong face.  Her hair had been pulled into a fairly elaborate braid the curled it's way down her back, she wore an outfit that one would swear was a leftover from some greek movie about the gods.  She wore a breastplate that was almost so highly polished it was nearly mirror finished.  The breastplate was put on over a long white dress that was split up the side to reveal her rather powerful legs, and her feet were covered in knee high strapped sandals.  He almost forgot to breath as he looked at her, she was like a goddess standing there, long spear leaning against the wall of his *den*.<BR>
	"Dear God in heaven... " was all he could manage to whisper out as she smiled brilliantly at him.  <BR>
	"I have something for you, you should like it... it was my husbands at one time.  I think it would suit you just fine."  She almost beamed tonight, which was odd that she was so ecstatic about the hunt.  Victor had her pegged for the non combative type, but then again she was in a battlefield at one point, this much he saw in the vision he shared with her.  She was certainly a sight to behold as she spun around and made her way through the clearing, Victor had to jog a few steps to catch up.<BR>
	"You don't have to give me anything, your teaching are more than enough Marie.  I'm the stranger here, and I've done nothing to deserve gifts and any special treatment." He really didn't want her to fuss over him or anything, already he'd caused enough of a stir in the camp.  Gunnar was already feeling threatened and wanted to off him, none of the other wolves would speak to him, they just watched him as he went about with Marie.  Even those few times her was on his own about the camp they would just eye him, not like they were suspicious... more a curiousity than anything.<BR>
	Finally they stopped in front of what must have been her den, actually den was putting far too much downplay on the rather well furnished pavillion they stood before.  Small bronze lamps shed a dull orange flickering light iside the pavillion and it's sooty smell permeated the area.  She stepped inside, turning around to retreat backwards while motioning him to follow with her outstretched hand, almost beckoning him to her.  He ducked through the open door and stood as best he could in this tent of hers, his eyes taking in the furnishings around the place.  All of the cabinets, small couches, and tables had to be antigues, the pillows that nearly covered the entire floor however were the most new things in the place. <BR>
	She retreated to a cabinet and opened it up, rumaging through it as he watched her.  Finally she turned slowly, concealing something behind her back and smiling at him wit a demure innocence.  She walked towards him, almost seductively as her hips swayed smoothly, which made Victor rather nervous.  When she got almost face to face with him she lifted one of hs hands, locking her eyes with his to prevent him from peeking.  He felt the hard, cold material being clasped over his forearms.  Each of his arms lifted slightly by her without even a glance down, and clasping what he knew were bracers onto him.<BR>
	After a few moments standing there, her hands resting on the bracers around his forearms, she took a step back and looked at him.  He lifted his arms under her scrutiny to glance down at them himself.   They were boiled leather, kept in perfect shape through the ages, the edges had been done in a lacework of silver.  On the outside of each one was a blazing falcon, almost pheonix looking in it's flight.  He noticed an odd set of bands that wrapped around them as well and looked closer to them.<BR>
	"They are for when you change, so they stay on you.  You are a little taller than he was, but you still shouldn't have too many troubles.  Do you like them?"  Her voice was now the one seeking confirmation and acceptance.<BR>
	"They are beautiful... but I can't take these, they are far too much..." He tried to bein taking them of but her hand rested on his and stopped him.  Her skin trembled slightly, that much he could feel as his eyes lifted to her.<BR>
	"Please, keep them.  They do no good sitting in an old womans closet.  You remind me of him Victor, you have a spirit like his.  He was also struggling with himself, and I still think that is what eventually brought him down.  I don't want to see your wife go through what I have, and I dont want to see yor spirit die so early.  You keep them, and you wear them, and when you are alone and feeling troubled, you think of me and what I have taught you.  When you are in battled, you remember tonight."  her face was proud, her chin lifted at a most elegant angle, giving her the stance of a queen or other form of royalty.  She was beautiful, truly astonishing, but she wasn't Ceile.  He smiled and nodded, leaving the clasps alone and tapping the silver falcons together.<BR>
	"Then I will wear them with pride." He smiled and turned his head slighty, sounds came to him from a distance away.  The sound of a howl, met by other howls... they came.</B></I></HTML>
