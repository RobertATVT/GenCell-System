	Long strides carried him from her Pavillion, she followed at his side as he moved, silent in the night air.  His ears picked up the howls long before hers did, after stepping out he could eve hear the paws slamming against the ground as the other pack raced towards the conclave.  His head bent a bit to the side as he listened, screams, yes he definately heard screams.  There was battle in the distance and he could feel the icy chill of the virus<BR>
begging him to join, pleading for him to shed blood.<BR>
	"Marie... they come, and they fight.  They are attacking us...."  His words were never completed as a black form leapt from the shadows at him, tearing at his flesh.  He spun and backed to cover Marie as he grappbed the wolf around the neck and began squeezing, holding the creature in his left hand like a toy.  He took a deep breath and began seeing without sight as his body began shifting... growing... readying itself for what was to come.  His mind cleared as the sounds of another wolf's flesh rending behind him was followed by a horrific yelp that slowly changed to the cry of a woman.  Opening his eyes he saw the firey half wolven shape of Marie standing there as he was, her form sleek and feminine but no less powerful.  She stood above another wolf, her great spear thrust into it's chest, and the wolven body melted away into that of a girl of Italian heritage...<BR>
	He looked down to his own hand and witnessed the last dying breaths of a young boy in his own hand... fodder.  This hunted Alpha must have filled his ranks with children to send in first, to try and wear us down.  Even now he could hear great roars of leadership rising into the night air, Gunther wasn't far away.  He looked at Marie, her face stern and resolute, children or no, the product of this creature will die.<BR>
	"Let's get to the fray, Gunther sounds in trouble... Antoni will pay dearly for this." Her voice was almost clear as she spoke and began moving off towards the growls and rising commotion.  Her steps were lighnting fast and silent as death, Victor was racing to catch up to her, he felt naked without his hammer, guns, all his hometown battle gear. Oh well, it was time to wing it, he could manage that, he always did.<BR>
	The two of them passed in near complete silence, passing the bodies of both Conclave and hunted alike.  Ahead they could see the din of battle, Two great forms being hammered by what seemed like hundreds of black wolves.  The large black form of Gunnar holding the more peaceful and badly batterd form of Marcus, his broken body coated in blood, most of it his own.  Gunnar was fending off the hoard of wolves the best he could, but Victor saw the panicin his eyes, he was about to break...  <BR>
	Victor altered his course slightly, enough to cause the unsuspecting Marie to tumble off into the brush getting her out of sight of the wolves.  He stood tall and roared into the night, the attention of the other wolves drawn to him as their gleaming eyes turned towards the new threat displaying himself to them.  Another growl roared into the night and and he heard a new voice enter the fray...<BR>
	"Kill him... I want him dead... NOW!" The thickly accented voice yelled as the huge pack of wolves turned and ran after him.  Victors legs moved off into the night and carried him away from Marie, Gunnar, and Marcus... his form slipping away as he got a few hundred yards from the three, giving the wolf leaders a chance to regroup with the waking and assembling allies.<BR>
	Victor looked around and saw the circling wolves surrounding him... they couldn't see him, but they knew he was there.  He took a few deep breaths as he heard Gunnar and Marie shouting orders in the distance, readying themselves to attack from the other side and come to his aid.... With a horrendous snarl he broke his cover and gave a claw filled backhand swing to the largest in the gathering, moving forwards and grabbing another around the neck and then sinking his teeth into yet another one.  The surprise of his brutal assault caught most of them off guard and gave him the chance to finish off those in his grasp already.  He knew of the others leaping at him, almost with a prenernatural degree of awareness, his body twisted and bent to avoid the first two lashing at him.  The third and fourth were beaten away in mid leap by the unconscious wolf in his hand.  More leapt and gnashed at him, only nipping and causing minor scrapes and cuts, but over time these would add up and he would eventually fall.  He ripped into more of them as they failed to attack him, more and more got little nips and he could feel the blood flowing from the wounds.  His claws dug into the flesh of the enemies and more reverted to the naked form of children and teens... Victor displaced the thoughts... this was not the time nor place, they would live... think of the battle, think of survival... his mind carried him into a sort of battle trance, the faces of his foes forgotten and his body moved out of intstinct.<BR>
	The sore, tired muscles in his body refused to relent, suddenly he felt the tide alter and Marie and Gunnar rushed into the fray.  The battle soon ended with that unfamiliar roar bellowing over the combat...<BR>
	"Stop this... or I'll kill the mortal Martel...."</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>
