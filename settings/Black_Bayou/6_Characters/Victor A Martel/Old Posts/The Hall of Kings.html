</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>	I invite you to walk with me through a vision, brought on by passion, madness, or the distant mind of a megalomaniac, I can't tell you the source.  I am simply a narrator, retelling tales of a life less ordinary.  The human mind is something of a mystery that scholars and scientists will never understand, and the greatest of philosophers underestimate.  Such workings, dreams and vision seem like mystical revelations and fragmented pieces of puzzled wisdom.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>	With a startled jump the figure in bed wakes, he is covered with a thin layer of sweat, his dreams apparently causing him much worry.  Strong scarred hands run through the long wisps of white hair that cling to his back, gathering them into a tail and quickly tying it off with a band on the bedside table.  Lean muscles stretch and groan, bones pop releasing the pockets of air trapped between them.  Typical sounds of waking for this near giant of a man.  Rough scarred feet are placed quietly on the floor as he carefully stands as to not disturb the fire crowned goddess asleep in the bed next to him, her tendrils of flame spread across the pillows and sheets like molten rivulets.<BR>
<BR>
	Long quiet steps carry him to the kitchen, the near full moon shining through the large series of picturesque windows that fill the far wall of the loft.  An eerie blue glow covers the place, making it appear ghostly and unreal, the air seemingly thick and misty, all discarded by the still unawake mind of the occupant.  A glass is taken and filled with cold water from the faucet the sound muffled and unearthly quiet, more the sound of a small brook bubbling as it winds it's way through a long forgotten hill.  Soon the glass is emptied and the figure moves over to a dresser, grabbing a brush and running it through the pale colorless locks, putting it in a better tie as he checks the scars across his face in the mirror.  Weary eyes almost discount the figure standing behind him... almost.<BR>
<BR>
	A well practiced spin brings him face to face with the figure, but there was nobody there.  For that matter there was nothing there, no Loft, no Ceile, no children, no Voletta...  nothing around him but grass, glistening in the moonlight and a small hill.  He was dressed, in his usual attire of a black tunnel neck shirt, black leather pants, the specially made Longcoat with the kevalr lining and strips.  Standing alone in front of this hill, with a small monument built into the side of it.  A mist flowed across the ground, nearly concealing the grass that glistened under the pale light of the moon.  A low rumbling growl rose to break the silence, his growl, his displeasure shown as his hands moved to verify that the twin Desert Eagles were of course left out of the picture.  Nearly weaponless, he hated having to rely totally on his beast, but his kind always had one weapon up their sleeve.<BR>
<BR>
	The thick granite door to the monument was pulled aside, the earthy grind whispered across the mist like a shriek in the night.  It took all his strength to move it, and judging from the growth around it, no man had passed this door in decades, perhaps even centuries.  The darkness inside echoed space and distance, he didn't feel the closeness of walls and knew that the monument went farther into the barrow.  Think, think...   a check of his coat proved useful, the snaplights and shoulder light were in place on the inside.  With one hand a snap broke the silence again and a cool blue glow made it's way from the plastic tune in his hand while the electic light was clipped onto the coat.  He would wait until needed for this light, it's powerful beam had a short duration that would last no more than 10 minutes before slowly going out.  Stick to the snap lights...  Already he heard an odd pulsing sound, less than a sound as one would think, but a feeling... like something force was beating into him, calling him, drawing him...<BR>
<BR>
	He checked the floor for any signs of tracks or movement, but the inch thick later of dust was completely undisturbed.  This place is ancient, a look around the place startled him for a moment as the looming faces of several statues stared back at him.  Each one holding an ornate sceptre in their hands, held to their chest.  The statues were of men all dressed in archaic armors and each of them held a resemblance, strong features eyes carved to great detail holding a feral look as they stared down on him.  The desire to smash his fist into one of the relics made a brief surge of anger flow through him, but it was soon quelled with the control he had developed over the past year.  A look around re-affirmed his suspicion that this was no small monument, the back opened into a stone corridor that sank downwards, the range of the light made out a few large stones that had fallen from the ceiling, probably long ago.  Just his luck to make his way down and find nothing but a collapsed corridor.  He might as well go, this was wierd enough already.<BR>
<BR>
	Careful footsteps carried him down the corridor, and the odd feeling that hit him as he entered got stronger, and with it the whispers of voices came drifting from the mist shrouded depths of this stone pathway.  The voices were familiar, long misunderstood but now he heard them clearly, he understood the ancient tongue they spoke.  They were calling to him, they were the voices that passed through the air each time he created a new member of his pack.  The same distant voices, but this time they were close, they were here.  His mind crawled, a tingling feeling ran through his skin like he was lying in a pool of insects.  A deep breath was taken as he steeled his will against this distraction and made determined and unafraid progress to the bottom of this tunnel.. this ancient monument to some long past warriors.<BR>
<BR>
	Suddenly the passage ended and he came into a large domed cavern, the wall cut smooth and propped with immense pillars.  More statues lined the walls, huge figures, the dress starting in full plate armor and as he made his way between them the dress got more archaic until they came to a single figure.  This large man was standing dressed in furs and some small amounts of armor, chain and leathers mostly, his face was sharp and feral looking, half wolven almost.  His ears were nearly pointed and the great detail of the carving showed tufts of fur at the tips, his fingers were clawed at the tips and his teeth were more fanged.  As he looked around he noticed the designs of wolves on the armor of each of the men, devices with hammers and wolves, and behind each of the statues ad the light created shadows, the shadows were of huge beasts, the forms of Rage.<BR>
<BR>
	All around him were the leering shapes hanging over him, shadows seemingly animate and watching him, following as he moved forward.  Watching his approach to the central figure, the man-wolf holding something in the massive clawed fist.  Closer he moved tot he staute and the object became known, the statues upstairs weren't holding sceptre's they were hammer's like this one.  This enormous hammer, the source of the pulse he felt.  The head of it shaped like a large maul inside the open mouth of a wolf, glyphs of long forgotten origin carved along the haft, and it called for him to take it.  Another step closer and he cought movement out of the corner of his eyes, the shadows come to life.<BR>
<BR>
	He was surrounded by the beast forms of all these men, apparently ancient heroes of some family line.  They circled him, these ghastly shades of a time long past, eyeing him with faded green flamed eyes.  Immediately his guard went up, ready for a strike from anywhere, his eyes nearly closed as his keen ears drew in the whispy echoes of the shadows, yes they made noise as they whispered to him.<BR>
<BR>
	"You think you are worthy?....  You can't have it... you are weak.... " The voices called to him, one beginning as the others ended, a taunting whisper.  <BR>
<BR>
	"If I did want the thing, what makes you think you could stop me? Go play ghoul and scare some children, I think I'll take it just for Spite." Vic's voice jeered out at them, taunting in return, the old parlay before a batlle... challenges.<BR>
<BR>
	Before he noticed on of the shades moved and tore at him, and it was all he could do to spin and let the coat take the shot, which it did in three slash marks.  Holy mother, Vic's combat senses went on overdrive as another lunged at him, and he moved in time leaving himself ample room to punch at it, and as he suspected his fist passed right through.  When he pulled his hand back it felt cold and numb, like frostbite had set in, but that was quickly forgotten as a searing pain shot through him and he felt claw marks above his kidneys.  They want a battle, they got one... with a small leap and a roll he moved past several while summing forth his battle form... but it was different this time.  His body popped and grew as usual, however his mind didn't pass into a haze of anger.   Somehow he had managed to gain total control of the beast, and the pale wolf let out a victorious howl.  The Shades backed up as this huge beast roared up, not out of fear it seemed however.  That didn't last long before they began their assault again.<BR>
<BR>
	He danced the steps of war with them, Alpha versus these creatures of shadows, the vengeful spirits of long dead heroes.  However valiantly he fought though, there were too many of them..  his pristine white fur was reddened with blood and then the call got stronger.  He felt the pulsing physically now, and it began beating in rythm with his heart, then he peered over to it...  a quick rush past them brought him to the hand and the hammer it held, but perhaps that was his biggest error.  The mad rush past them left him open to numerous slashes and hacks and he began to feel weak...   He'd made it here though, and his hand grasped the hammer and held it aloft as the Shades stood watching him.  Though he knew that he was done for he let out another howl, this one a mix of victory, defiance, and summoning his family to see his final moment of rage.  <BR>
<BR>
	Behind him the statue smiled and stretched the hand to rest on his shoulder, and his wounds began to close as before his eyes The Guardians stepped to his sides.  His head reeled as he saw his lifemate step beside him, her hair like the raging fire she held inside her, a mask of defiance on her face.  Ceile, his wife and love came to his call and stood at his right ready to fight with her mate.  To his left came James, his cousins face was calm and knowing, secrets of destruction for many breeds locked in his mind... his Beta stood at his left fists ready to do battle with his Alpha.  Then his eyes caught more movement to his right and Ann's furious angered face moved past Ceile, her eyes burned with rage and hate that something would dare bring such harm to her recreator.  They were all coming to him, Travis stepped up beside James his head bobbing from side to side sending crackling pops through the deathly silent chamber.   Laura cam up behin James, her soft faced grim with determination and resolute will.  But where was Lexi?   Look around as I might I didn't see my little Lexi, my pup who would be son.  Then came a crack, a booming sound to break the silence and one of the shades exploded in whisps of steamy darkness.  Then I saw that from behind one of the statues at the other end of the corridor a small brawny figure stepped holding a rifle easily as tall as he was... My boy made it...    And with another bellowing howl of defiance I led a  charge of epic quality, swinging the hammer with terrible fury as we stepped into war.  <BR>
<BR>
	All around I saw the Shades solidify into the shapes that surrounded us in stone, manifesting in their once living shapes.  And before him stood one of the greatest men in history, Charles the Great, Charlemagne himself.   Well, Charlemagne is in his face with a broadsword and goin down.  The now refreshed and overjoyed wolf swung the mighty hammer down on his shield over and over as others ran to aid the timeless hero, only to be caught by the slashing claws of one of the Guardians or to come on the recieving end of the hammer.  The battle was led verbally by Victor as he battled the great conquerer, each slice of the kings sword met with a brutal blow of the Hammer.  Soon the numbers were evened out and the pack was winning, the fury that Vic felt fed his pups, the lines of creation flared as his stregth was both given to his pups and bolstered by them.  They would have victory.  <BR>
<BR>
	Then it happened, the sword of a King slid through Vic's abdomen, pressing out of his back with a gout of blood.  Sword trapped this was the only chance Vic had, with a howl of agony he stepped forward and hammered down on the King with the hammer, the blows smashing against his chest and shoulder and driving him to his knee...  The rest of the Shades were dispersed and the pack stood around in various forms, and states of health.<BR>
<BR>
	"You are truly one of us, Welcome Victor Martel...  You have brought our line back to us and won the right of the "Hammer", take your namesake and do Justice.  You carry in you all the blood of Kings, great Heroes and Warriors, and I see that the heart the beats in you all is fitting to hold it."  With that the Shade of the great Charlemagne passed into the mist as did the rest, leaving Victor and the Guardians alone in this cavern, this Hall of Kings.  Then it was all gone.  The pack wasn't there, the hall wasn't there, he was again standing in the loft, naked and sore bleeding from a wound in his side and a huge hammer in his hand.  Justice....  will be served.<BR>
