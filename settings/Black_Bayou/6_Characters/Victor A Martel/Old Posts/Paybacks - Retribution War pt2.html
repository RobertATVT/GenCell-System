The day was kinda dreary and the two days that Vic and Alexi had already spent working on this sojourn left him kinda bleak.  Not to mention that he had killed four people the other night.  That was the hardest for him to grasp.  He knew that the killer instinct was inside him now, but to this extent?  It worried him.  Not because he did it, but because he almost liked it.  He like the feeling of power that he got from knowing that these men were his<BR>
lessers.  HIs eyes had a cold look the next morning when he awoke.  Alexi hosed one down with the automatic weapon.  The one that had shot Vic in fact.  Alexi was too innocent for this, but it is his revenge.  How coul I stop him?  Was it fair?  We got the hummers the other night, right where the KLA Captain had told them they would be.  They killed and stolen.  What were we being reduced to?<BR>

VicMartel: 	::Enters the Airport and walk calmly to the baggage claim, his eyes a distant cold green as he peers for Ann and Blake having already sent Wolf  with Lex.  After few minutes he sees them and approaches, calm... almost too calm::<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>AnnLMrtl: 	:: Her long hair now pilled back into a tight French braid, keeping it out of the way.  She reaches out and pulls her bag off the conveyor belt as it nears.  Her eyes fall quickly onto the stout form of Victor.. hard to miss::<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BlakeExavr: 	:;he slings his bag over his shoulder and adjust his shades as<BR>
he looks around, his eyes land on vic as he draws near and give a nod with a grin:: hey<BR>
bud<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
VicMartel: 	Hope the flight was fine...  if you have anything, lets get moving. ::With that he spins around and begins to walk out of the terminal to the hummer::<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
AnnLMrtl: 	::she smiles the energy in her green eyes:: Victor.. ::she smiles with a quick nod, she turns on her heals and steps after Victor::</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BlakeExavr: 	im ready...::follows victor sliding off his shades and tucking them in his<BR>
jacket pocket::</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
VicMartel: 	::his quiet and cool demeanor seem to be a compensation for something flashed in his eyes, something very unlike him...  without a word he unlocks the doors<BR>
and slides inside and starts it up waiting for them to unload their gear and take seats::<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>AnnLMrtl: 	:: Tossing her bags into the back, she slips into the back seat:: (s)Victor, what are we up against?<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
VicMartel: 	::Pulling out he sighs a bit and heads off::  Alright, here is the deal...  I sent Wolf and Alexi into the city to get a few supplies, they wil be back sometime tomorrow evening.  Alexi, although filled woth rage is unready...  I have picked a couple bunkers near our HQ that are too dangerously close to us.  Tonight we will hit one or both of them and gain what supplies we can... use as little ammo as possible, I wll not be using a<BR>
gun and will be doing mainly recon and silent hits.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>AnnLMrtl: 	:: Her green eyes watching the landscape as she listens closely to Victor, a smiles touches her lips:: (s)Silent is the only way to go.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BlakeExavr: 	::nods::(s) i use my hands...so what ever ammo i find i will<BR>
save for ann and the rest<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>AnnLMrtl: 	(s)I rather use my hands or dagger Victor.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BlakeExavr: 	::reaches up to his ear and switches on his ear piece::<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>VicMartel: 	That is why I have the two of you with me... we are the first to<BR>
go in...  we clear sentries and bunkers, I can move totally unseen and strike from nowhere,<BR>
while you two come up once I have raised attention but taken out what I can..  then the rest come in with the blazing gun VicMartel: 	thing going.  tonights targets I have already scouted out... there are four Serbs per station, we can easily route them...  Ann and I in Wolf form on the entry, Blake you get thebike...  once the initial attack has taken place you jet up and assist.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BlakeExavr: 	::nods:: (s) just radio me and i will be ther in no time...but if it gets to thick you guys get out...<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
AnnLMrtl: 	(s) We will be fine Blake.. We are Martels are we not?<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>VicMartel: 	That is where you come in...  even should we drop I need you to mop up...  drop a grenade if you have to to do it... it won't kill us.  Nobody gets left behind.  And if it is deep we will need a hand.  ::Reaches into the console and pulls out two black boxes and two black straps:: These are Lash mikes...  I figure you both know how they are used.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
AnnLMrtl: 	:: she smiles:: Yes, we do.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BlakeExavr: 	::nods::<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>VicMartel: 	Alrighty... for the most part...  we think to each other...<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>And thus the plans began... we routed how we would enter, what time... all that jazz.  I was amazed at what a decent leader I was.  They listened to me and did what was needed.  The ride to Sunset Staion was a bit bumpy but taking a Hummer over open country would do that for you.  We soon arrived.  Sunset Station was nothing more than a very large barn on the outside.  Stacks of Hay all along the walls<BR>
and even a few critters roaming around.  Inside however was a different story.  One quarter of the 50 x 5 bar was taken up by a huge Steel Vault that the armament was kept in.  Another Quarter sered as sleeping quarters, walls lined with bunks and a few lockers for personal items.  Quarter number 3 was the mess and lavatories.  Last but not least was the war room, set up with a satelite dish and a CPU, stolen maps from a UN briefing room and a few<BR>
other needed items.  Of course this was all the upper floor...   The bottom floor held stalls where the vehicles were parked and the walls lined with Ballistic Plating.  The place would do... a good attack on us would end up wiping us out... but that just meant we had to stay secret.<BR>
<BR>
