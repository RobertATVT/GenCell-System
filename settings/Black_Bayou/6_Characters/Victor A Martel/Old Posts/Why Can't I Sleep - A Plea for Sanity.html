</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	It was a typical day for Vic.  Meditation and self sacrifice had become the staples of his life.  He was torn between two women that he would readily give his life for.  One was his creator, the Golden haired goddess that gave him his animal.  The other a raven haired mystery that tantalized him and brought that animal to the fore.  The first was fully alive, vibrant and breathing life every moment.  The second was a creature of night and shadows who slept cold and unbreathing.  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	They both touch his soul in places that have been locked and closed for over a decade, and it hurts. How they have managed and when it started is shrouded in the fog of lost memory.  He knows what he feels...  he is a man of emotion.  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	When Victor got into Voletta and began meeting people he met Skye Heart in the first couple weeks. From that day on he was smitten by her likeness to his long dead love, and was enraptured by her gentle loving kindness.  She was fair haired and appeared like an angel to lift the sorowful burden from his shoulders.  Only to be replaced by the weight of his unreturned love.  In a fit of pain he went as far as to shoot himself to keep from hurting her, to keep his rage from taking over.  boy did that hurt.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Victor met Cleo in the Symposium and offered her a job since she was leaving town to find one.  He didn't know her at all, a complete stranger, but victor had always poured his heart into the world to try and help those who had not.  He also saw something else in her, from that first moment he knew that he would see a lot more of her. More than that, he knew that he wanted to see more of her.<BR>

	Now it comes to bare that the  thing holding him from Skye was gone.  He loved her to the center of his being, he suspected tha he always would.   Cleo's coldness was shattering around her like fragile glass, and she was becoming even more dear to him.  He loved Cleo now more than ever, he vowed to never leave her side.    Skye was in love with her vampire and Vic with his, he recalls the irony of how he berated Skye for her :unnatural relationship<BR>
with him".  What a two faced, pompous jerk he had been.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Yesterday he had the chance to sleep in Skyes arms, to hold her, to protect her.  He had the chance to feel that  blissfull warmth of another warm body next to his.  He turned that chance away though, he went to Cleo.  He spent the night wrapped in her room temperature limbs, feeling no pulse or breath.  Sometimes if he thought about it it kinda freaked him out.  The realisation that he was in essence sleeping with a dead body shocked him awake on occasion.  But he loved her, and this dead body would wake up when the sun went down and love him.  She wouldn't admit to it, but he could see into her heart.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	So now what was he supposed to do... he is the one who got evan to run headlong into some plan to split Skye and Deimin apart.  He was the one that professed undying emotion, loyalty, and devotion to Cleo.  His darling, cute, loving, angry, argumentative, stubborn, thick headed, antagonizing, trouble making, hateful, spiteful....  nevermind, he still loved her.  Call Javin, talking to him the other night eased him to no end...<BR>
 even when Cleo busted in and made a frightful scene...  I'm going to call him now...  who cares if it's 6:45 am...  He is family now.  ::ring::  ::ring:: <BR>
