The silent murmuring of my children tinkled across the air like small chimes.  Such a relaxing sound, that of the cooing of children enjoying life and jus the fact they are alive.  if I could only save them from the hardships that would hit them in the future.  How I pray that they won't go through the same misery I have, the same tragedy that has turned me from a cheerful exhuberant youth to a cold, grave, man.<BR>

	... Her hand sat there frozen in mid air for a few moments before the feeling of warm metal landed lightly in the young man's hand.  The feeling was accompanied by the light sound of a chain unfurling and the coiling of that chain in his palm.  When her hand was withdrawn the sunlight caught the metal and left a starry yellow glint blinking up to his eyes.  A Locket.  A simple golden locket perched there, it's gold chain coiled around it like a metallic serpent.  A fluttering warmth sprang in his chest, that giddy nervousness that one gets when they recieve a keepsake.  He flipped it open and there she was, captured in filmed perfection.  Golden hair blending into the locket, and her face smiling graciously up at him.  All he could do was smile.<BR>
	"Do you like it Victor?" Her light voice carried to him as he sat there looking at the locket, gazing at the beauty of her in the small dainty picture.<BR>
	"Yes, how could I not... it's... it's beautiful, it has your picture... how could it be anything but?"  He smiled, barely able to choke out the words past the lump that was growing rapidly in his throat.  His hand fumbled for hers, finding it finally and closing around it with a soft squeeze.<BR>
	"I love you..." her voice wasn't much more than a whisper, they had always known that was how they felt, but until now it had never been said.  How those three words could affect him, the lump grew even larger and threatened to strangle him... but he fought it.<BR>
	"I love you too Suzette... But my father...  He has plans for my marriage, or so Mother tells me.  I don't want to marry anyone else Suzette... I want to marry you.."  How hard this was to say... all their lives they grew up together, played together, and had fallen in love together.  They snuck around as children and spoke quietly about running away together, but as they grew older the responsibilities to their families took precedence.  Now his father has plans to marry him off to someone... someone he's probably never met, and it all came down to family business.  His bride to be would come from a family who owned shipping companies like his father did, and it would cause his own to grow.  Then when Victor got older his father would pass both businesses to him to run, all as it had been for the last 300 years.  All in tradition, all in the family, all in the old ways.  Victor hated to old ways for that reason alone.<BR>
	" I know Victor, my father has similar plans for me... he'll probably marry me off to some old man, someone I'll hate.  Let's run away Victor, just you and I... I don't care if we are poor... just as long as we are together..."  Her voice was pleading, her eyes were practically begging him to say yes, but he couldn't.<BR>
	"Let's just see what they have planned... surely our parents know how we feel, surely they won't do that to us."  With a slight lean his lips were brought to hers and he kissed her ever so lightly, and he then stood up.<BR>
	"I have a meeting with Father, I will call you tonight... don't worry, if worse comes to worse... we will run away. I promise." With another smile he turned and began making his way back to the house, wanting to maintain his composure before he both burst out in joy and crumpled in terror of losing her.  Such simple worries they were then.<BR>
<BR>
	That day was remembered fondly... he carried that locket for a long time, he doesn't any longer...  He let that crutch slip long ago, he gave her memory to freedom, he cut loose the pain he carried.  It was perhaps the hardest thing he had ever done, it was also the second worse day of his life.  The locket now rested on the marble bust that held her image in the mausoleum where she and her family now rest.<BR>
