Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Vic has been going through a series of changes since he bacame an Alpha, the spirits of his ancestors call to him.  When he was young in the ways of the wolf he possessed the knowledge of how to use his for to his advantage in combat.  This Art is called Lycanjitsu.  Victor began to doubt and distrust the wolf until his Cousin James came to Voletta and he began to build his family, tired of the isolation of the other packs in Voletta.  But it was a bit late, he had passed into doubt and left his fighting form behind for more mortal styles.  With the resurgance of power because of his true Alpha position he has become infused with control over his form and control over his own Horus.  Because of this change the old Arts call to him to complete his learning and become once again one with his Warrior.  Because of this call he has contacted Damian to show him some things about the Art... this will awaken the knowledge that he once possessed.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Because of the surge in wolfen power that Vic has gone through as a result of becoming an Alpha, he will once again turn to the wolf and learn Lycanjitsu.  The purpose of the SL is to allow him to begin his retraining where he left off at Level 4.  He has never forgot the form, just repressed it in denial of the wolf in himself.  Damians teaching will re-awaken it due to his strength in the mystic art and Vic will begin his studies in earnest.<BR>
