<BR>
	The call came from his son, his mind frantic and thin as it stretched across space like a mystical bond.  The message was mostly unclear, but Victor knew how to make sense of Lexi's usual frantic banter.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="0"><I>Fear..<BR>
<BR>
	All of Victors worst fear rose into his throat, the ill feeling threatened to make him sick again.  He rushed out of the new dojo, grabbing his guns and a t-shirt as he nearly flew down the stairs.  Seconds later he was busting through the front doors and to the lot and to his LM002.  Pulling open the door he tossed the guns and the shirt onto the passenger seat and slid inside, the keys jabbing into the starter and a slight twist bringing the engine to life.<BR>
<BR>
Anger...<BR>
<BR>
	The LM002 had never been opened up like this before... his path leading straight for Voletta.  The trip would normally take thirty-five to fourty-five minutes, but at his speed that time would easily be cut in half.  He'd spent his days and nights living by a strict code, trying to overcome his killing urges... trying to live up to the promise he made seven months ago as three angels brought his son from deaths grip.  The shock of Joe's death bringing the vivid reality of who he had become to the forefront of his mind.  He'd become a monster.  He came to this island filled with grief and loss, hating all things holy for the loss of his first love... that hatred would end up being directed towards the living in some vain noble cause.  In reality, he was no better than those that had succumbed to his justice.  Now this... his wife, his love had been attacked and injured enough to warrant Alicia's medical skills.  Once again he wasn't there to protect his family... what would it take? <BR>
<BR>
Madness....<BR>
<BR>
	He hadn't seen the visions in a while, the had cleared when his path had become clear.  He had joined the Sheriffs Department so that he could try and repay his debt to society by doing the right thing and bringing justice the correct way, using the laws instead of claws.  They begun again... he could see people screaming in agony everywhere he looked.  Bodies laid bloodsoaked in the road,  they hung from the trees he passed, and they smacked against his vehicle only to burst into a spray of gore.  He was losing his mind again, he was loing himself to the rage and hatred that lived inside him.  This time he might lose the fight, this time he might lose to the monster and there would be no return.  He could feel himself slipping away, he could feel himself being smothered by the hatred and killing urges.<BR>
<BR>
Revenge.....<BR>
<BR>
	He would kill him... he would strip out his insides and feed them to his family, then he would carefully peel off the mans skin and use it to wipe himself every day until it fell into tatters.  The mans bones would would be ground to dust and spread through the sand for all the denizens of Voletta to trample, and his eyes would sit on Victors desk so they could forever watch the man that destroyed his wifes assailant.  Hopefully he was a vampire... that way this misery could be revisited a thousand times, a never ending saga of destruction and pain. Victors claws would drip weekly in the mans gore... and eternal life of torture.<BR>

Arrival......<BR>
<BR>
	He was there before he knew it, Lexi's last message was as direct as needed... the lab next to the beach house, he knew it well enough and was on his way.  Moments later he was there, and rushing towards the front door after skidding to a stop on the sand in front of the former home.  He pulled on his shirt and strapped the twin .50 cal holster across his lower back and began to sniff the air.  His enhanced sense of smell would ferret out if there were any intruders hidden in the shadows or using Dispas to hide and wait to strike again... that's when it hit him... the severity of the crime against his wife.  he could smell Ali in the back, as well as Lexi and Ceile... but the scents that struck him the hardest were fear, blood, and sex... her sex... her blood... and her fear.  The wave of madness washed away like sand in a rainstorm, leaving nothing but agony and pain.  He went to the back room, seeing first her feet... covered in splattered blood... then he saw her body, bleeding and curled into a fetal position, tiny wimpers escaping from her once beautiful lips, now they were split and bleeding.  He stood and looked at Ali, his mind stretching out to her.<BR>
	>>Was she raped?<<<BR>

<BR>
	That was all it took, he was broken... this was far beyond anything he could have feared in his worst nightmares... then Lexi gave him the description of the last man she'd been seen with... Noah Slater... slowly he stumbled outside, his head swimming in confusion as his slid down the outside wall and began sobbing.<BR>
