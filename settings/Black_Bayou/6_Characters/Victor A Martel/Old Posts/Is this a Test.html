He took a deep breath and walked to the front door, bag in hand and gave Ceile a kiss as he went... he kept his lips sealed for the most part, wanting this all to be a surprise for his family.  <BR>
	He walked the short distance to his vehicle and got inside, the engine purring to life with a simple twist of his wrist, and off he went.  The drive was easy, across the bridge to the new SD Headquarters, people milling about and doing their jobs... most of these people Victor has come to despise, but this was a job now... his job.  It took a lot of years to come to this decision, and he felt that it was the right thing, time to get on track and get things in order.<BR>
	The loneliest steps carried him deep into the heart of the new building, his resolve building as he walked on... how the maighty have fallen...  He made it to the gymnasium, a human spectacle if there ever was one.  The largest man in the building... he takes a breath, used to being the freakshow.  He walks over to the trainer in charge, perhaps a big man to the rest of these guys... but he doesn't worry Victor in the least.<BR>
	"Victor Martel, I'm here to go through my admittance tests, I believe I'm a few minutes early."  His deep voice rolled out, a polite tone kept at all times.<BR>
	"Yeah, I don't care if you're the queen of <TOSing> England, get your big ugly <TOS> over there in line with the rest of the recruits before I kick you over there."  The shrill southern voice wipped at him like a Scorpions stinger, actually it was kinda humerous.  Here's this little man, up in Victor's face... or chest to be more specific and yelling like a drill seargent.  A brief flash of imagination wiped through Victors mind... a flash that would leave this little man split into a few different pieces and thrown about the gymnasium... but then it passed and Victor smiled and walked across the Gym to the others... giving the recruits the proverbial... "Yeah, go ahead and smile... I dare you" glare.<BR>
<BR>
	"Alright girls, it's time to go through the worst day of your pansy existances... time for you to prove that you aren't cheerleaders... you see those teeter totters over there?  Hop on them you pansies and let's see if you <female dogs> have any balance."  Victor rolled his eyes, just knowing that this guy is going to get older, and die long before he would made him unendingly happy.  He stepped over to one of the boards and climbed one, evening out the boards and crossing his arms over his chest.... and stood like a rock, unwavering and the board never moved.  The sounds of the other recruits falling around him and retrying was laughable, but he remained.  Even when the schreechy hic came up yelling at him to distract him, he simply cocked an eyebrow and looked down at the man.  Another flash... more blood, then the visions cleared.  <BR>
<BR>
	The rest of the "tests" Went equally well, easilly passed and in the end Victor was top not, not even breaking a sweat or breathing with slight exertion.  Bicycle speed was constant and a breeze, sidestepping... Come on... Victor was a world class Martial Artist... that was real tough let me tell ya.  Sit-ups... Vic did more than that every morning for himself... no challenge.  So he passed the athletics and endurance part... now for the next step.<BR>
