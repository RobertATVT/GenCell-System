The difference was subtle, new knowledge that sat in the corners of his mind.  He was different, he had powers granted by his blood, powers to remove the wolf from his pups.  He also realized that he had gained yet another step in his control of the Horus wolf.  He was truly an Alpha now.  His control over himself and his lineage was solidified, as was his position in the pack.  He felt it shortly after he had taken Ceile as his mate, sealed the<BR>
lifing of two wolves together.  Forever bound together, his Alpha female.  With the wedding added to it his life was nearing completion.  Now he simply needed peace with Skye, his life would merge into what he had hoped.<BR>
<BR>
He was once again practicing in the dojo, building his fighting skills to a keen edge, they will soon be needed.  Rumors of war filtered through the air and perched in his ear, whispering its tales of death and hatred.  His own kind hunting themselves like the snake eating it's own tail, ternal struggle and suffering.  His arms moved with unnatural speed as the sword twirled around him, his eyes focused on nothingness, his mind allowing his body to<BR>
go through the movements independant of it. Instincts.  The wolf.  All came together in a serene fluidity as he moved.  All to be shattered when he heard her voice.<BR>
<BR>
"Vic?" Her voice came like the lilt of a flute carried on a breeze, from the door she made her way inside.  His hands dropped and he moved her way, sword in hand.  Her blonde hair cradling her face, the cupid lips drawn and formed in perfect sadness.<BR>
<BR>
"Hello Skye."  Closer to her he walked slowly ptting the sword away. "How are you?"<BR>
<BR>
"Fine, I wanted to thank you for the present."  The small teacup monkey he bought her held above the curve of her belly.  She cradled it like a baby, like her baby.<BR>
<BR>
"Of course, even though I tend to screw up and I hurt you, I will always be here for you." He stepped forward again, drawing closer to her.  Absently she stepped back, not wanting to be so close to him.  A pain ripped through his heart, how could he have hurt he so badly.<BR>
<BR>
"Are you afriad of me Skye?  I won't hurt you, my feelings haven't changed." Stepping closer again.<BR>
<BR>
Another step back, she moves carefully. "I am not scairt Vic, you now things can never be the same again."<BR>
<BR>
With a heavy sigh he drop to his knees showing submission to his sire,  head down in shame and grief. "I am so sorry Skye, I never meant to hurt you.  What can I do to make it better?"<BR>
<BR>
"But what you did will always remain, I can never forget." Her face attempting to hide the grief she feels, mixed feeling tearing at her as tears fall down her cheeks.<BR>
<BR>
"I have found happiness Skye, but I cannot be complete without you.  With everything I have there is a void where you used to fill."  Sobs tear through him as he speaks... breaking his words.  "I love you Skye"<BR>
<BR>
With a few steps she clears the distance and place a hand on his head, running it through his hair.  "Victor, I am suffering conflicting emotions here."<BR>
<BR>
"How can hate and distrust conflict, they go together well" tears drop down his cheeks, and his back is hunched and trembling.<BR>
<BR>
"I want to hate you Vic... but I can't.  I forgive you." Her hand stops and rests on his head lightly.<BR>
<BR>
He stands and looks away from her, never bringing his eyes to her.  "I should go"<BR>
<BR>
"Where?  This is your home" A hand reaches out to his cheek and runs across it lightly.<BR>
<BR>
"Work, anywhere. I just need to get away" He turns towards her slowly, still not looking her in the face.  "I still love you Skye".<BR>
<BR>
"I love you too Vic." She stands there hand falling off his face as he walks away from her.<BR>
<BR>
Halfway out the door he looks back at her, sadness and joy conflicting in his eyes. "Have you ever thought about what we could have been?"<BR>
<BR>
"I don't think we should be thinking about that." She smiles at him kinda uncomfortable.<BR>
<BR>
"You are right, I will see you later." With that he is gone, off to work, solitude, lots of thinking.<BR>
