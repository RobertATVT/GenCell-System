	Life continues after the long silent pause as I lied unmoving on the rocks.  I could hear the voices and feel the movements around me even though I am sure that I was dead.  Shortly after the world went black and once again I am floating through that solemn darkness.  It's not a cold darkness that I float through, but a warm smothering void.  Not an uncomfortable feeling actually, more like once again being enclosed within the warm loving embrace of your mothers womb.  <BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover:<BR>
My arms shall welcome you when other arms are tired:<BR>
I stand to wait for you, patient in the darkness<BR>
Offering forgetfullness of all that you desired.<BR>

	I can see the remnents of my life flying past me again, the usual frenzy of memories and reality.  This time however something is different, they are shattering before they reach me.  I scream and reach out for them but they disappear before I can.  I can just see their shadowy contents before they splinter into millions of tiny needles stinging my mind.  As each silvery pane shatters before me I feel an emptiness growing inside me, like something is being removed from me.  No!  Something is taking my life away, my memories...  everything I knew is leaving.  Please God leave me something, something to know... someone.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>I ask no merriment, no pretense of gladness,<BR>
I can love heavy lids and lips without their rose;<BR>
Though you are sorrowful you will not weary me;<BR>
I will not go from you when all the tired world goes.<BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>She stands in the garden with golden hair kissed by the sun.  Her laugh is like the sound of a thousand silver bells as it echoes through my head.  The light dances off her porcelain skin and gleams from her rose red lips.   The sight of her is like and Angel sent from Heaven.  Her small Skye blue dress cathcing all the depth of her crystaline eyes.  The flower in her hands seems to be alive from her touch and all of nature beckons to her to stay.  But for some reason I know that she will fade.  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>I am the Dark Cavalier; I am the Last Lover;<BR>
I promise faithfulness no other lips may keep;<BR>
Safe in my bridal place, comforted by darkness,<BR>
You shall lie happily, smiling in your sleep.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	For some reason the feelings of being smothered became feelings of security when I felt that one.  I wonder who she is, she is such a beautiful girl.  I must have known her, I hope I see more of her.  I wonder if she is my sister, what could her name be?  What could my name be?  That is curious, I should know who I am but I can't quite recall.  OH GOD!  Please make them stop shattering and stabbing my mind!  Please let me see them and find who I am.  Let me find out who she is, she is so pretty and I feel so.....<BR>

Whether your feet tread stone or grass,<BR>

<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	I looked around the room to see who was all here, there was Alexi,  and that Black headed girl...  I think this is her place.  With a relaxed turn I look at the large window and there she is, the beautiful blonde woman.   She stands there with her golden locks falling about her shapely shoulders, the red shirt making her face vibrant and alive.  Her lips so serenely shaped like cupids bow, like they eternally wait for that special kiss.  Her eyes seemed to drink everything they saw and reflected only beauty and purity.  She seems like an angel, another gorgeous angel.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Whether you've pence to spend or gold,<BR>
Whether you've toil or time to weep,<BR>
Comes the one pain that may never be told<BR>
And may never sleep;<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Ah, Alexi...  I remember him, the lonely Gypsy boy from Europe.  He came here with me, wherever here is.  There is that secure feeling again, it comes from that golden angel in the light.  Her sight makes me warm and safe, if I only knew her name.  I would give everything I own for her, I know that much.  I know that I have given much to her already, and she has given me more.  I just know that I would die without her, I think  may have already.   For a brief moment I feel my body shake and quickly jar, like I had convulsed or was bumped.  Where am I?  Who am I?  Who is the Angel who walks these dark visions.  That Angel that holds me to this void corridor and promises hope and happiness.  I am floating without rhyme or reason, without time or space.  The emptiness around me is only filled with my thoughts of her, there is no Skye in this world and nothing to lie on.  Just space, just shattering memories, just a life gone by and thrown away.  The blackness is coming...  I feel it's dread hand pulling me, no please let me stay with her...  nothing but her.... nothing but......<BR>
<BR>

Whether you tell or still deny,<BR>
Comes the one scar that your heart shall hide<BR>
Till the day you die!<BR>

(All voyages seem slow and full of peril, but if we never take that first step we never see the wonders beyond our vision.  In all things we must seek the purest moment and keep it in our hearts for that is the food on which hope grows.  This is a Journey and a Vacation for me and I hope that it's duality may be enjoyed and some measure of entertainment may be gained from the pain gathered within.  My journey is just beginning.
