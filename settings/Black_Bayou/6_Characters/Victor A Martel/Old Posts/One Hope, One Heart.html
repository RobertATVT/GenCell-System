	There was something fresh about Ceile, not flowery or light and airy, but with a dignity and strength that I admired.  An air of confidence covering layers of doubt.  for once there was a gal that I didn't want to try and save or help, just Love.  There was a genuine feeling there this time.  Of course the feelings were always genuine with the rest of them as well, this time it was just her though... no other reasons.  With Melanie it was a youthful<BR>
vigor that I felt I needed to regain and be a part of.  With Kim it was innocence that I tried to recapture, having felt that I had long lost my own. With Skye it was a different story, at first it was as if I had found the one love that I had truly known and lost.  Then after I was created by her the bond that was created between us strengthened that yearing into thundering force.  But it wasn't all for her.  Don't get me wrong I do love Skye with<BR>
all my heart, but it is more a family love now.  It is understood unlike before when my control matched that of my understanding of my own kind.<BR>
<BR>
	Ceile however is a different story. I am looking for nothing in her but what is there.  No trying to recapture a lost youth, no trying to forgive myself for past misdeads that I have done.  Nothing, just love in its most basic and instinctual form.  I offered to take her to Los Angelas for the weekend, I wanted to get away and do something nice.  So we did, and it was.  We got a suite at te Beverly Willshire Hotel, then we spent the rest of the next day walking rodeo drive.  She loves to shop...  that is one thing I learned quick.  But it is alright, she is worth it.  Why not have the most beautiful woman in the bayou have the nicest clothes as well?  Makes perfect sense to me.  So I led her along, not having been here before myself I was in absolute wonder at the sight of it.  The weather so pristine and beautiful, the buildings elegant and class all around.  I was so happy.  Ceile by my side and all the world paled in her wake.<BR>
<BR>
	The shopping went grand, and by the time evening rolled around we were ready for some fun.  I checked around and found out about this dark dance club with a high goth and rave element to it.  The walls and columns throughout the place covered in black marbel with black lights and deep blue neon coursing over them.  The floor being made of slabs of black and purple marble fitted in what seemed to be this large soling mystic symbology.  The club had the feel of magic and mystery, yet completely hidden to the mortals that played like things they weren't.  The fangs were fake and the lightskin was an illusion brought on by makeup.  But I felt alright here.  We danced until our hearts would explode, setting the dance floor ablaze with a primal passion that most of these wage slaves and part time freaks could never muster.  We were the real deal, we hadn;t sold our souls to boredom and falsehood. <BR>
<BR>
	We were two flames dancing amongst the icecaps, but hey... keep the fire going and the icecaps melt.  And so they did.  It was wonderful.  Finally we were both exausted so we returned to our rental and then to our suite.  And you would be amazed at what even tired fire can accomplish... I sure was.<BR>
<BR>
	And now we are back in Voletta, things haven't settled since I left, like I honestly expected that they would.  But all in all this town lacks something.  It lacks heart, it lacks faith, it lacks hope.  Well I have enough to share...  maybe by example I can shed some light into the unaturally dark corners of Voletta.  As long as she is by my side I can stand strong, with my new family behind me we can do things that are needed.  The time is now, and<BR>
love is afoot.<BR>
