The car sitting in the drizzling rain, the headlights catching the small drops ahead of him like tiny fairies falling from grace.  His eyes were stinging from the tears and the<BR>
smoke of his cigarettes but his mind was frightfully clear.  After his talk with Skye and the humiliation by Deimin his mind was horribly lucid as to what was  left to do.  The engine of his sleek black sportscar growled in the rain, the lights blaring over the angry dark void of the cliffs.  No notes, no warnings, no chance that he would get out of this intact.  This is where it all began, where Melanie and Madeline Boudreaux once lived, where he<BR>
first met Skye.   He remembers that day with clarity, her standing in Melanie's room staring out the large window, the sun carressing  her like an angel.  Now all he saw was the night, all he saw was her pain, his world was on fire and he lit the match.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

With his incredible hearing he can hear words floating through the wind.  The voice is of one of the twins, but it's not telling him o scram or get lost, must<BR>
be Melanie.  He shakes his head clear of doubt not needing her to witness this while carrying their child but those are the breaks he can't stop now.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

What do you need?" The small form begins walking faster to the car, but she can only make it halway before the engine roars and the tires spin in the grass and begins to race forward.  Maddy runs towards the car fighting to keep her step in the slick wet grass, she<BR>
knows that she cannot reach him so she lets her mind open and send him a message.  The contact is made but it only reaches the eerie silence of hatred.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

For Maddy it fell in slow motion, the doors never opened, Victor never even moved...  what's worse is that he even seemed to be smiling happily.  The car smashes into the rocks below and still no body<BR>
flung free, even as the body of the car rips and twists apart. <BR>

To finally be free of the pain he feels for the hurting of Skye, the loss of Suzette, the loss of Cleo, the loss of everything<BR>
he has very loved.  He smiles serenely, now giving himself the rest he has searched for the last ten years.  He has never allowed himself to think of killing himself, but now he doesn't feel any more options.    He can see the ocean before him as he takes everything in slow motion, his mind absorbing every detail.  The ocean had always been one of his favorite places to be, it reminded him of his youth.   His youth, and Suzette.<BR>

He could feel his body lunging forward as the dash board and stearing wheel smashed back into him.  The whipping of his body caused a horrible crunching sound that echoed in<BR>
his ears.  He felt the pain in his spine as it snapped, right as the wheel broke into his face.  His legs buckled under the dash as they mangled under it's pressure.  A rapid popping and tearing shot through his chest as his rib cage collapsed.  Then there was the light, the sudden burst of light coming from the exploding gas tank.  He would never feel the burning as most of his body was already dead and unfeeling.  Then nothing but blackness and<BR>
warmth .<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Feeling the heat come from the wreckage below Maddy can only think "Mon Dieu".  Victor is down there, he is burning and broken.  What would bring him to do something so horrible.  She pulls out her cell phone and dials 911, I hope theat there is something left for them to find.<BR>

(Thanks to Skye (Skyexxxxxx), Cleo (LoraleiC), Maddy (MadelineVB), Melanie (MelanieDL), and all the rest of you.  This is goodbye to the Victor that you all knew.  This is his end.  But like the Pheonix, lets hope that his new beginning may be as glorious as he rises from the ashes)<BR>
