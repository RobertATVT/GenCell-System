</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>GI Joes or Transformers?  That is the question.  Whether tis nobler to suffer the lasers and machinactions of Cobra, or to take up against a raging Megatron and end all.  Alright, so Ceile whipped my butt when we were playing.  She cheated.  Plain and simple.  Darn woman had three decepticons hidden under her belly and another tucked neatly behind her elbow...  devious.  Plain devious.  But then again,<BR>
what woman isn't?  <weg><BR>

Ceile laying on her stomach on the tile floor with her head back laughing gleefully.  With a point at her admiringly he walks closer to the cameras.  Watching her frozen there with her luscious red hair spilling across her back and shoulders::<BR>
<BR>
See that?  All the devious in the world couldn't make me stop loving her though.  ::Winks and lowers his voice mving to the camera to whisper::  And she's a hottie to boot.<BR>
<BR>
de*vi*ous (adjective): not straightforward : CUNNING; also : DECEPTIVE<BR>
de*cep*tive (adjective): tending or having power to deceive : MISLEADING<BR>
<BR>
I think you get the point.<BR>

::Throws his hands up with a "I give up" Stance:: Granted, we have had rough times... ::Mumbles something akin to DAMIAN KNIGHT:: But those have been resolved and like adults we moved on to the next phase...  Making up... Oops, I mean Marriage.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>::Slips back to his pre-freeze pose and the scene moves again.  Vic begins chuckling and throwing a mock tantrum on the floor:: You cheated!  Bah!  I want a rematch woman!<BR>
