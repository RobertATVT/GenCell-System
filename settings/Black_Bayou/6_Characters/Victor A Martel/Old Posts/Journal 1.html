	Been a while huh?  Well let's see if I can fill in details since last I wrote here.  Ceile and I are back on track, I told her that I would stop the Justice killings.  Of course I can't actually do that, but if it keeps her with me I have to at least play like I am adjusting.  There are two overwhelming passions in my life, my love for her and my desire for Justice.  I've already ended the lives of the 23 individuals that I had intended to, all normal people who were disgustingly corrupt, the child molester, the rapist, the playground pusher (Is still dying as we speak, it's been two months for him), the armed thief, the slasher, the AIDS infected whore who knows of her ailment but seeks vengeance, the pimp that has forced young runaways into prostitution and his Porn merchant partner that films them all without their knowing, the executive who uses his position to coerce his secretary into sleeping with him....  the list goes on an on.  So many tragic souls needing to be removed from this battlefield earth.  <BR>
	Yes, I do see the earth as a battlefield.  So many of us simply try and live out our lives as best we can and exist in harmony, but you have all of these vile ichorous abominations running around killing and torturing the innocent without any TRUE form of justice.  Real Justice is banned by the corrupt legal system that has been bought off by the men with the most money so that they can use these crimes and destitute wastrels to make even more money.  The law has been taken out of the hands of the people and given to the chosen few allowed to uphold law and order in their communities without say by the people.  Anyhow, I'm ranting like a Zapotista Freedom Fighter.  There are more people around here that need to visit Justice of sorts.  I'm not going to mention their names in true... but you know who I am talking about.  Here's the list of next victims:<BR>
	#1 The Faith Stealer:  A man so base as to try and steal a good man's religion from him.  Granted I am no devout follower to any religion, but I feel the same way about my Justice, and those that want to take it from me.<BR>
	#2 The Lost Child:  One of my own kind who has forced himself out of his family, alienating himself with deep rooted paranoia and a total lack of respect for authority.<BR>
	#3 The Ravager:  Yet again one of my own kind that seeks to create with the virus without permission or want.  This is one of the most tragic and hate filled acts I have witnessed, to create against someones will and even knowledge is deplorable.  This cannot continue.  Lone Wolves must be destroyed.<BR>
	#4 The Rogue Knight: Once a noble and proud honorable figure, this individual has perverted truths and ideals long held sacred to many.  Like the black knight of long ago a call to arms has been issued for the destruction of one who would bring dishonor to his kind.<BR>
	#5 The Innocence Thief:  Innocence is the last shred of goodness that exists in many of us, something that should never be betrayed or stripped from someone...  but this pathetic, disgusting, betrayer has done so to a wonderfully beautiful creature.  For that his death will last for the offendeds years in months...  a possible few years of dying agony.<BR>
	#6 The Coward: Like the Innocence Thief, this wretch has brutalized  a soft, caring, tender, and fragile beauty.  What kind of MAN could take advantage of someone weaker than him like he has done.  No excuse warrants pardon, and his lack of importance will warrant him a quick death, lucky for him.<BR>
<BR>
	I am sure that more people will join the above list, some are in mind right now... but I am watching them...  waiting for them to be as obvious.</HTML>
