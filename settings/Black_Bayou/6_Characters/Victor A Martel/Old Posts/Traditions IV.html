</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Once agin it was Marie the broke the silence between them, her presence was strong and commanding as always, even as the tears rolled down her perfectly preserved cheeks.<BR>
	"Victor, tell me about the rest of your family, you have a wife?"  Her curiousity seemed endless, and why she wanted to know so much about him was still left unkown.<BR>
	"Yes, I have a very beautiful wife.  Her name is Ceile, you remind me of her actually.  She has hair like yours, like its almost spun from fire, and her eyes are incredible.  She has your strength to some degree, though she doesn't understand our ways like you do, I hope that some day she will.  I don't think that she was ready for this kind of life though, I don't think she quite understood what it would mean when she made her choice."  He almost felt like slapping himself for being this revealing, but in Marie's presence he would tell his darkest depths without fear.  Something about her brought out truth, something in her her made him just want to tell everything about himself.<BR>
	"What do you mean she didn't quite understand?  You made her?"  Another question, always another question.<BR>
	"Yes, she's one of my pups.  I gave her the choice to be one, but I used the lure of pack and family to get her to choose.  I warned her about the beast in us all, warned her about the rage, but all the while holding the belonging over her.  I stole her from under the nose of two others that wanted to make her into something else, one of which I know is a vampire.  I wanted her though, so badly to be with me forever."  He broke his contact with her eyes and looked at the glyphs across the table, his free hand tracing a few of them to distract his attention for a few moments while he colected himself again.<BR>
	"You've both hurt each other haven't you?  You more than she.  Am I correct?" He felt like she was stabbing inside him, each question cutting out a small piece of him to lay onto the table for examination, like she see's every little piece of him inside.<BR>
	"Yes.  She cheated while we were dating, while we lived together.  I took it real hard, it's one of my biggest issues with a relationship.  It took a while for us to get over it, I just recently got over it myself.  Then not too long ago, I was weak and cheated on her with a wolf from another pack.  We were married at the time which made it worse, I'm still not sure that we are out of the woods with that yet.  I want to blame everything on that horrible little town we live in, but that's not the reason."  He didn't want to say anymore, he forced his lips closed and picked another glyph to start tracing with his hands.<BR>
	"That's not all you've done is it?  I can tell that there is more, but I won't pry any farther, it upsets you to share like this doesn't it?"  She reached out anf lifted his head by his chin to look at her.<BR>
	"Yes, I'm not used to having someone to confide in, and I'm certainly not used to going to confession.  I really try to be the best person that I can, and I try to be the best Alpha that I can.  I struggle like anyone else, but I have more to struggle with than your average mortal father does.  It's hard for me to hold back the desire to avenge and kill, I want to slaughter those that harm innocents and betray us."  he could feel his neck begin to burn with anger, that slow dull throb that always happens when he thinks back to some of the things that he's done.  The Lucesco's, the drug pushers, the thieves, the rapists, the filth around Voletta.<BR>
	"Why do you do it Victor?  Is it for them, or is it to satisfy a need that you have and they just seem to be the best cause you can think of to justify your actions?"  Her voice wasn't accusing, it was simply asking... digging maybe.<BR>
	"Does it matter?  Does it matter if I like to kill so long as the cause is just?"  His voice came out almost a challenge, at least he tried to get it that way... after looking back it seemed a pathetic challenge and almost like a plea for an answer.<BR>
	"All the killing in the world won't fill that emptiness Victor, and it certainly won't bring her back.  She's someplace else Victor, she's doing what was meant for her to do.  Maybe someday soon you will find her killer, maybe then you will be able to lay her to rest for good.  Do you think she would be happy with what you have become?  Have you ever thought that she can see what you are doing to yourself? " Her words spoke harder than any punch could ever land.  He reeled to some degree as he watched her looking at him like a caring mother would console a child lost in the midst of a winters depression.<BR>
	He tried to stand to break away from her powers that wrapped his mind in this numbing blanket of openess.  He wanted to crawl away and hide from her insight, never before had someone thrown his life back at him like this.  His legs buckled and he fell back down, clambering to hold himself up by one of the trees surrounding the table.  Finally the effort was too much for him as his chest heaved and like he was unable to breath.<BR>
	"How... How do you know these things"  He leaned there in shock, unable to find the strength to move away from her as she watched him.  She could feel what he was going through, the guilt of what he's done, the shock that she knew, the regrets, the doubts, the fear, the shame.  Everything came crashing down like she knew it would.  Her plan was simple, in order for him to learn he had to have a clean slate.  He had to be able to forgive himself and forget any old ways that didn't coincide with what they believed.<BR>
	"Just sleep now Victor, we'll talk again in the morning."  Her voice was the last thing he heard as a roiling blackness crept across his vision.  Dreams took him....</B></I></HTML>
