	Pretty day.  I like it that way personally, no rain or snow...  just pretty.  I also like kids, and don't even go there...  Kids are wonderful, so open and blunt, not a care in the world.  This one I promised I would watch over, and I will.  Shall I rewind?  Not too long ago a certain miscreant found himself faced with someone who would proceed to enact justice on him.  What was this justice over you ask?  This man happened to have been caught on film molesting his daughter, a young lady of nine years.  Maria.  Who was this deplorable reprobate caught by?  Take a wild guess.  The following morning, Marias mother would wake up alone, no trace of her husband.  Maria said a special prayer that night, this time she thanked God for taking her dad away so she wouldn't be hurt anymore.  The police found an unusual lack of evidence, the only thing that appeared to be missing other than Mr. Molester, was a picture of Maria...  You really have to hate those runaway fathers.  What does all this lead up to?  I made a vow to myself that I would watch over Maria, and guess what?  Here I am, sitting across from the school playground in my Diablo.  A lot of the kids seem to like it, but Maria's class hasn't let out yet.  Just a little walk over to the fence sets the kids into a flurry with tiny whispers about the big creepy guy in the black car.<BR>
<BR>
	A few short moments was all I had to wait, then here came Maria.  Jubilant and bouncing it seemed, like the weight of the world had been removed from her shoulders.  In a way that is correct, a great weight was removed.  I couldn't help but smile as she bounded out, but then that smile would fade... here came Billy and his crew of ruffian low brow playground bullies.  Of course, my usual plan of action would be scaring the last three years out of someone, but these were just kids afterall.  Instead I made my way over, that alone stopped the group.  Maria was half afraid herself, but she had a little spunk and looked at me challengingly, tough little cookie.  Billy and his cohorts stood in awe, to a child of none or ten I must seem a giant.  To the imagination of these children I must seem a monster, the scars about my body giving me a freakish appearance.  Oh well.  They aren't far from the truth.<BR>
<BR>
	"Maria, I take it?"  I said with as much softness to my rather deep voice as I could muster.  "My name is Mr. Martel, and if any of these boys wish to keep pestering you, please don't hesitate to ask my help."  With that a simple stand and mild glare was all it took.  Despite the awe held in the boys eyes, the fierce bravado that I child can take in this all to invulnerable state, the darkening of little Billy's trousers belied a different message.  Maria smiled though, not a smile of glee per se, more of a smile of whicked revenge and with a lightning fast spin... you know that speed that always catches us adults off guard...  she planted a foot square in Billy's groin, wet spot and all.  Now I've heard all sorts of howls in my days, from kids mewling in agony, to grown men with bullet wounds, to wolves at the full moon.  Billy's was like that of a five year old girl that just got her pigtails yanked.  Truly a sad and pathetic sound.  What happened next was nothing unsuspected, Billy's ravenous pack of jackals soon turned their leering jests and taunts to Billy.  What did surprise me however was the large hug from Maria, which I carefully returned with a smile.<BR>
<BR>
	"Thank you Mr. Martel" Her tiny voice carried to my ears and not a million gunmen could bring me down at that moment.  All the money in the world couldn't compensate for that one thank you, for that one hug.  However nice, and however much it confirmed that doubting part inside me... I knew I had done the right thing.  Whatever risk I had taken was worth it to see that little girl happy, to free her from the perversion and sickness commited on her.  <BR>
<BR>
	"I have to go now Maria, I don't think Billy and company will be bothering you anymore.  I am sure that you will see me again, this is a small town after all. "  The two of us walked a little ways, nobody paying us much attention now, they were all having too much fun at Billy's expense.  "Do me a favor, go back over there and stand up for Billy, show him that you are a big girl and can forgive...  I'll be around, but I want you to be good...  You have a lot of potential, and I'll be keeping an eye out to see some of those drawings of yours get famous...  but for now...  farewell."  <BR>
<BR>
	With the last word I made my exit, walking to the car and starting it, the window rolling up in it's blackness...  Maria standing there waving, then bounding off to Billy's defense like I asked.  Yup, she's a good kid... this is her moment to shine.  This was my moment to look for the next Justice...  </HTML>
