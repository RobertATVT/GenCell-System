He had caused Evan to go forth and break Skye and Deimin up, which I guess is better than killing him.  Evan was so hot-headed, but like me he just wanted to see her happy, you couldn't tell him anything without him going on a tangent.  I have tried to be there for her, I have tried to love her, I have tried to be everything that she has ever wanted.  But I am not Deimin.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	I bought her a car this morning and drove it to where she would be with a big red bow and ribbon around it.  That cost him just under fifty thousand dollars, but she is worth that one hundred times over.   His legs begin to cramp as he sits in the floor lotus fashion for the 6th hour today.  His thighs scream in agony and his back is straining to keep him aloft, but his supernatural health is no match for his sef loathing<BR>
torment.  He will sit here until he either passes out from exposure or something looks up for him, some answer to his torment.<BR>

She was furious but tried not to hurt him, the pain of the struggle inside her was obvious, but the torment of not receiving her blessing tore at him.  He sat in the floor that night just wanting a slight answer.  He almost flew into frenzy that night,<BR>
he almost attacked her in nothing more than rage.  He could feel he change lying right beneath his flesh, he quickly ran into the kitchen to calm down.  He tried to supress the rage, but it was beginning to take over he flung things off the counters, pushed the fridge over on it's side.  He knew that it was too late so with the last shred of his rational mind he stopped it.  The loud powerful crack of the 9mm pistol ripped three times through the building.  She ran through the dojo and stopped at the kitchen door to see him lying there in a pool of his own blood.  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	So I can take things too far, I knowhow much I love her and I dont want to hurt her...  I would do anything to keep from hurting her.  Anything.  Now the guilt is killing me, I caused this all to happen to her, I caused for Lazarus to control Deimin and drive him away from her.  I went over to Evan's crying and blathering about how much I loved her and he went nuts and made a plan... the plan.  It has thus far worked perfectly as planned, and I am starting to hate myself for it.  Every time I have seen her since then the pain in her eyes stabs my soul.  Every time I see her eyes glazing over from the misery, the torture that I feel inside rips harder and harder at me.<BR>

	Sometimes it sucks to be in love but in the end, if you get through the trials and the tribulations,  it's all worth it.  Love is the fuel that keeps some of us running, I know it is for me.<BR>
