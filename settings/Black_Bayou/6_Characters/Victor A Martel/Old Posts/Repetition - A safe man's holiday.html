	Things were beginning to start as planned.  My pack was steadily growing into the family I had dreamed it woul be.  My own family disrupted by a tragedy years ago, and now it is hard to believe that I have called this tired, quiet little town home for almost a year.  I relax and sink into the plush King Edward victorian chair and look out over the soft rolling water past the large winows before me.  The sight is breathtaking, of course it isn't<BR>
Barcelona, but what else could compare?  The waves rolling and lapping at the sandsbelow, the wind singing against the glass...  beauty.  All things seem at peace in this twilight moment with the sun setting, sending its warm glorious rays out for all to see one last time.  The act seeming to be a call for one more bit of attention before he sleeps.  Aahh, this place has far more secrets then Helios would ever know, his arms never reaching some of<BR>
the more dark and twisted denizens of this bog infested Isle.  His faced turned on those wicked and vile creations that burn at his touch.  Unnatural things, dead yet walking, talking, loving, scheming...  These beings are similar in several ways to me, unnaturally strong, healing faster than science could explain, changing our forms at a whim, similar...  yet a world apart.  Me and my family being a part of the natural cycle of things, these<BR>
blasphemous abominations cut from the very life of the world itself.  Parasites.  A sigh is all that escapes, spreading through the empty loft like a whisper of the past.  Now don't get me wrong, I know several of these things..  I have even loved a few and made love to even more, but it doesn't make them right.  <BR>
<BR>
	Bracing myself on the arms of the chair, my hands sinking into the soft velvet, I rise to crossthe raised platform that makes my bedroom and den.  With soft slow steps I cross to the old crib next to the bed.  So small in comparison, the tiny raised crib next to the double king canopy bed.  But he and I are a similar contrast.  His small sleeping body laying in the crib, tiny, so fragile I fear for him every time I raise him from his miniscule<BR>
shelter.  I know that I could never hurt him, but still I fear.  I hurt so many others, I only pray that I will be the father he deserves.  Like my father was to me.  That hurts.  Now he is gone, but I vow that I will never leave my boy,  Little Victor will have his father forever... no matter what it takes.  Every time I look at his blushed face and those eerily similar green eyes my heart seems to expand, pressing against my chest threatening to<BR>
burst free.  Such a wonder he is.  I still can't believe that Kimberly left him to me, I can't believe she left.  That was shocking, our time together so short, the love there, but not like it was...  not like she wanted.  We weren't right, it could not have been meant to be.  Even as hard as I try and how much I love Skye, once again the fates hae other plans.  But this gift, this joy...  this is the purest and most precious thing I have known.  So<BR>
small as he can curl into both of my hands...  I know love now, real love.  I spend my days with Little Vic, every waking moment I am by his side.  Not that I know much about raising a pup, but hey...  I am a fast learner.   <BR>
<BR>
	Here comes Alexi, always diligent to care for the Dojo, to watch Little Vic when  Ann isn't available.  I try to get him to do something more than sit around here cleaning the floors, but I guess he has this learning through suffering complex.  People must think I am horrible.  Every time they walk by there is little Alexi, cleaning the floors, polishing the statues...  always busy.   I guess everyone has to have a hobby, I just wish his was one<BR>
that made me look less like a tyrant overlord.  But hey, Alexi is the Closest thing I have to a little brother.  If anyone layed so much as a finger on him unwarranted I would tear them in two.  But that isn't gonna be easy since he never leaves the dojo.  He needs to get a date is what he needs to do...  Oh well, his perogative.  I have to get dressed anyhow, so I bid him farewell after a few words of encouragement sounding more like pressing him<BR>
into finding a woman.  I pull open the walk in closet to a seeming void, all the clothing black and pessimistic, but hey... someone has to keep black in style.  With a laugh I get dressed and walk out to the garage...  ready to commit to yet another repetetive night... go to the Symposium, get half buzzed, flirt with any female available, run into some trouble, then skip out with the woman I love...  Maybe it's me that needs the hobby.  Alexi may<BR>
have the right idea after all.  hmmmm, I think I am going to clean when I get home tonight.... <BR>
