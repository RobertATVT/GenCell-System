The Central Computer, in all aspects, has a <B><editted until Phase 2 is complete and approved will resubmit then>.</B>  The Central Computer can track all Fairlight employees while they are on Fairlight Teritory by their ID badges.  Split along the sides of the badges, underneath the lamenation is a small monitorring microchip.  Fairilight has set up a web of sorts between its buildings.  The badges work only within this web.  The web stretches from building to building (Omsford Investigation, Jameson, Moiriarti, Imagica, Magi, the Bugle, WKRV, the Symp, etc etc).  If someone were inside this "web" or if a security badge was inside this "web," Fairlight would be able to pinpoint where.  This would not work if they were outside the web's zone  by as much as 10 miles. (ie. Washington DC, there are no Fairlight buildings in DC, hence, not able to track them.) This monitorring is done by the security team.  The computer uses Optic wiring scatterred about the building for monitorring purposes and is connected through a direct sattelite link up to all Fairlight branches and is exclusively within an intranet.  Fairlight holds several phone lines for modem and T-1 access for the Internet, but that is seperate from the Intranet access.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> But, more specifically, the badge (no matter what the level) is an industrial strength, fire resistant and tolerant, all-weather device that could withstand a hurricane or a Blazing inferno and still survive it.  The Polymers used in it are unique in a fashion that it cannot be broken (like a credit card can be), chipped, etc and the swiping of it can never wear off.  If said badge is found, it cannot be used to gain information unless the encrypted program within the Central Computer is used (same hacking TN for it is used.) The Central Computer also manages all power, lights, water, etc of Fairlight.  In all aspects, the computer can respond to simple voice commands and has devices all throughout Fairlight which it can hear these commands which allows the computer to register the voice, know its meaning, and do as requested in as much time as it would for a human to think about it.<BR>
     <BR>
     For example, a two-way intercom is placed in a room.  Joe Schmoe has fallen unconscious, a person with the adequate Security protocals can state "Call 911" and the computer will dial 911.  Although, the computer willnot tell what is happenning, it will report in a computer voice an automated response using a male voice stating "Fairlight Inc., located at <so and so> is having a medical emergency, please send an ambulance."<BR>
     <BR>
     This sort of Techno-magick can also work for the lights. Like the Clapper does for clapping, he computer will do for the lights.  Working off of a sensor, if a person with the propper security calls "Lights on" The lights will indeed come on.  <BR>
     <BR>
     More complicated verbal commands like "Computer, hit Nick the Brick over the head with a cone" will not work.  <BR>
     <BR>
     This technology is readily available and the users of Microsoft use it all the time in their corporate Headquarters in Renton, WA.<BR>
     <BR>
     If power is cut off, Five sperate generators will kick on automatically to power the computer and the rest of Fairlight's essentials.<BR>

    <BR>
    An Open Security Manager is a standalone application enabling network managers to centrally manage an enterprise-wide security policy that can be enforced on a variety of network security devices, including those from Cisco, Nortel (Bay Networks), 3Com and Microsoft. Using the ireWall-1 GUI, administrators can reduce configuration and management time by eliminating point-to-point router and firewall configuration. Instead, a single enterprise security policy is automatically deployed to all enforcement points. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>OPTIC CABLE</B><BR>
    Optic cable, itself works off of a more secure cpabaility, in and of itself.<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>THIRD PARTY SECURITY</B><BR>
    With Open Security Manager, existing Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be imported and compiled into object-oriented security policies for easier management. In addition, Open Security Manager can receive Syslog files from third-party security devices to deliver centralized logging and reporting capability. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>INTRUSION DETECTION<BR>
    </B><I>The system will:</I><BR>
    Detect intrusion attempts and network misuse in real time. Respond to unauthorized or suspicious activity automatically by logging, recording, or terminating actions.  Prioritize network events in flexible, intuitive reports.  Monitor enterprise-wide networks from a central location.  Enable dynamic reconfiguration of routers and firewalls based on pre-defined policy<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Protection Against Common Attacks </B><BR>
    <BR>
    There are several common types of attacks that hackers employ to gain access or damage a companys network. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>IP Spoofing -</B> A technique where an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access through a false source address to make it appear as though communications have originated in a part of the network with higher access privileges. For example, a packet originating on the Internet may be masquerading as a local packet with the source IP address of an internal host. FireWall-1 and VPN-1 Gateways protect against IP spoofing attacks by limiting network access based on the gateway interface from which data is being received. <BR>
    <B>Denial of Service Attack - </B>There are many types of denial of service (DOS) attacks. One type of DOS attack is a SYN Flood attack where a TCP connection is initiated by a client issuing a request to a server with the SYN flag set in the TCP header. Normally the server will issue a SYN/ACK packet back to the client. The client will then send an ACK packet to the server and data transfer can commence. When the client IP address is unreachable (due to a false source address for the client), however, the server cannot complete the connection, but it still reserves system resources in anticipation of the connection. <BR>
    <BR>
    <I>When the server receives hundreds or thousands of connection requests that cannot be completed because the client is unreachable, the server will be unable to service legitimate clients and will deny all service. </I><BR>
    <BR>
    <B>USER AUTHENTICATION</B><BR>
    User authentication services securely validate that the users attempting to make a connection are who they say they are before the communication is allowed to proceed. Modifications to local servers or client applications are not required. Authentication services are fully integrated into the enterprise-wide security policy and can be centrally managed through the graphical user interface. All authentication sessions can be monitored and tracked through the Log Viewer. <BR>
    There are three authentication methods:<BR>
    <B><BR>
    User Authentication <BR>
    Client Authentication <BR>
    Transparent Session Authentication </B><BR>
    <BR>
    <B>User Authentication </B><BR>
    <BR>
    FireWall and Gateways include transparent User Authentication providing access privileges on a per user basis for FTP, Telnet, HTTP, and RLOGIN connections, regardless of the user's IP address. If a local user is temporarily away from the office and logging in from a different host, the security administrator may define a rule that allows that user to work on the local network without extending access to all users on the same host. <BR>
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Client Authentication </B><BR>
    <BR>
    Client Authentication enables an administrator to grant access privileges to a specific user at a specific IP address. In contrast to User Authentication, Client Authentication provides a mechanism for authenticating users of any application, standard or custom. Client authentication is not transparent, in that the user must first connect with the FireWall or Gateway to be authenticated. It does not, however, require any additional software or modifications on either the client or server. Client Authentication is done via a Telnet or a Web browser where the user accesses the firewall, and is then authenticated before being granted access to network resources. All authentication schemes (e.g. SecurID token cards, RADIUS-based solutions, static passwords) are supported. <BR>
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Transparent Session Authentication</B> <BR>
    <BR>
    Transparent Session Authentication can be used to authenticate users of any service or application on a per-session basis. After the user initiates a connection directly to the desired server, the FireWall or Gateway, located between the user and the destination, intercepts the connection, recognizes that it requires user-level authentication, and initiates a connection with a Session Authentication Agent running on the client. The Session Authentication Agent performs the required authentication, after which the FireWall-1 or VPN-1 Gateway allows the connection to continue to the requested server if permitted by the security policy. All authentication schemes (e.g. SecurID token cards, RADIUS-based solutions, static passwords) are supported. <BR>
    <BR>
    ALl may be expected to appear, including: <BR>
    <BR>
    RADIUS (v1.0 and v2.0) - The user is challenged for a response, as defined by the RADIUS server. <BR>
    TACACS/TACACS+ - The user is challenged for a response, as defined by the TACACS/TACACS+ server. <BR>
    S/Key - The user is challenged to enter the value of requested S/Key iteration. <BR>
    OS Password - The user is challenged to enter his or her OS password. <BR>
    Internal Firewall Password - The user is challenged to enter his or her internal FireWall-1 or VPN-1 Gateway password. <BR>
    Axent - The user is challenged for the response, as defined by the Axent Defender server. <BR>
    SecurID - The user is challenged to enter the number displayed on the Security Dynamics SecurID token card. <BR>
    <BR>
    Computer passwords are based on a 10 symbol alpha-numeric system, never any common words, dates, etc. <BR>
    <BR>
    ie. ZZX0-94-SDRF or Zzx0-94-sdRf <2 different passwords> <BR>
    (note, caps does matter in the password)<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>SECURE...<BR>

     There are two top security clearances, only three people have both of the top Security Clearances: Arius Zaven, Kil Schmidt and Zion St. Croix.<BR>
     <BR>
     The Alpha controls all building access.  With this ability, a person can go anywhere, at anytime and no security measures will respond.  A person with Alpha Clearance and only a person with alpha clearance may grant people Beta Clearance and anything lower. <BR>
     <BR>
     The Omega controls all computer access.  A person with Omega clearance, has the ability to do whatever it wishes with any and all computers within reason.  A person with Omega clearance may add, delete, and program computers and programs.  A person with Omega clearance may grant people Beta Clearance and anything lower.  <BR>
     <BR>
     </FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Beta Clearance<BR>
     </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>Top Security personnel have this clearance. With it, they can use the computer to track personnel, observe all security measures; have complete computer access and the "techno-magick" abilities of the Central Computer.  They can move easily thoughout the building, but are still monitorred.  They cannot change any computer directives.  Beta Clearance grants the ability to give people Sigma Clearance.<BR>

     </FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Sigma Clearance<BR>
     </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>Typical of most of Fairlight, most personnel use Sigma Clearance.  In order to gain access into any restricted areas, they must have at least Sigma Clearance.  In order to log into the Intranet, they must have Sigma Clearance.  <BR>

     </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Retina scans, complete fingerprinting and background checks are required for all members of the Fairlight team.  If they have been hired, it can be considerred that they have  had the above done to them. A dossier is kept on Fairlight employees which would include medical background, education, personal history, references, their picture, and criminal background (if any).  Also, all contracts, etc require the same amount of information.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12> Internal Security of Buildings<BR>
  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>	All Fairlight buildings are fire resistant with sprinklers that will automatically go off when a fire is sensed.  Sprinklers are scatterred through all buildings with fire extinquishers at every few hundred feet and fire blankets as well.  The sprinklers work off of the Central Computer as well as independent sensors in case the computer or power goes down.  Fire walls come down every few feet and are controlled by the Central Computer.  They're airtight and used to "squish out" a fire between two tripple thick steel fire walls.   <BR>
  	Retina scanners are at the entrance of all "Alpha and Beta Clearance" points.  A securitry check point is there as well where the person must sign in.  If at any time someone is not supposed to be there, security is notified.  A list of who is enterring and leaving each room is recorded and storred for future analysis.  Panoramic cameras, fire resistant work under all conditions.  They cannot be turned off and each work off of individual baterries as well as being connected to batteries.  A spliced connection allows the cameras to lead to Secure Radiuses (see Symp SL) as well as Eclipse and the main opperating system, the Central Computer.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><BR>
  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>	Devices in buildings allow security to know who is in a room even if they haven't gone through a propper way of enterring. (ie. going from myst form or spirit form to normal, it's immediately registerred).  Knock out gas can be engaged at any time by flooding a room with it as well. Security personnel are armed with nonlethal weapons. (Licensing for all items have been granted already by the state and federally, if neccessary).<BR>

 </B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Fairlight helicoptors are armorred and armed with nonleathal weapons.  Those that patrol the ground have weapons that will fire rubber bullets.(propper licensing has been recieved).  The windows are bullet proof as well.  Fairlight ground vehicles act in the same manner with double thick metal and bullet proof shieldingEach also carries emergency supplies within it and carry cameras on the outside of each that is tapped into Eclipse Security. Fairlight's logo is on the sides of said vehicles and on some there are no symbols and, hence, unmarked. (I may submit a seperate SL to add more details to this),<BR>
