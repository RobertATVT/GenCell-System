	Have you ever had one of those nights where your dreams seem just a little too real?  Like you are dreaming about being in a trench in WWI and cannons are going off around you, but they are just too real sounding?  Well there I am last night, sleeping all cozy with my baby Ceile, Little Vic in his crib and here I am dreaming of cannos.  Seeing as realistic as they are I begin to shrug off the nice numb veil of sleep and sit up in bed looking out the<BR>
window, when BOOM and this flash of friggin light goes off...  Next thing I know that goofy Rasta is spilling into my head...<BR>

	Pirate ship at the Docks?  You gotta be kidding me...  With a long sigh I get dressed and leave a note for Ceile telling her where I will be in case she wakes, and head out to the docks.  As if the cannons blaring weren;t enough of a tip off,  I get there and kinda just stare in amaement.  A real, honest to God pirate ship.  No dingy with a skull and crossbones, but an honest to goodness Erol Flynn, 3 masted, Captain Hook would be jealous of Pirate<BR>
ship.  And there is Roland in a pirate hat, Jerod looking like the Crown Royal Mascot...  Otis like Napolean...  All I could do was stare in awe.<BR>
<BR>
	I know 10 minutes had to go by before I trudged up to the gang plank with Lexi Wolf my new pup at my side... After the other night we kinda gave him a make over.  It was cool, he looks like me in wolfie almost..  silver brendel stripes up his back and eight Big honkin silver earings...  course he is more wolfish, I kinda look pit bullish sorta... Oh well, he still looks like a kickin Urban Primitive like his Alpha...   So there we go following that<BR>
Mammoth that Roland calls Dad... I think Bear is his name or something.  All I know is that if the boat can withstand him on it...  it is very worthy...  I mean... look at him, he's a darn human spectacle...  like 8 feet tall and a good volkswagon in weight... and I thought I was a tall boy...   <BR>
<BR>
	Well the party started in earnest, Ceile soon showed up, and the ice queen Cleo was there...  Jeez... what a mood killer there.  But hey, I wasn;t there for her old room temerature backside anyhow, I was there to Party with Roland and Jerod and Admiral Otis.  The Goon squad.  And to be honest with you, it was the best time I have had in a very long while.  Bear and Cleo swinging from the mainmast and into the water...  Rolnd diving from the cross<BR>
beams, Me and Chance swinging into the water...  Then Lexi got smashed On Vics Green, a nice little beverage I concocted and poured into the doggie autofeeder water bowl...  Raven showed up and got kerplunked... Brownies flying around with Mama Deshcains special "Oregano", Dr. Mike was obliterated and high as a cloud...  Cleo got dressed in a tight, and rather revealing vinyl nurse outfit...  two girls had been wrestling in Jello (Rolands obsession),<BR>
Chase showed up, Chance was without underclothing and smelled kinda...  well.... animalistic...  What can I say the night was one big blur of fun and comeraderie...  Cleo and I patched things up, at least till one of us shoots off at the mouth again (Like that is a rare occurance for either of us huh?)  By the end of it all...  Crew was picked for Her Majesties Royal Naval Vessal "The Spliff", Jerod in his funny hat and cape was the King, Roland was<BR>
Ships Captain, Otis was Admiral, Sandra (one of the Jello babes) was first Mate, Bear was the Lookout in the crows Nest, I was Ships Cook (Aka. Bartender), Raven became Navigator, Mike was Ships Surgeon, LexiWolf is Captain of the guard, and I think that covers most of it...  oh...  wait...  Cleo, how could I forget poor pantiless Cleo...  She is the ships Cabin Wench <weg>  I didn;t make that call... <g>  <BR>
<BR>
	Well after casualties were counted or carried off the rest is to become history...  Maybe Urban Legend if we are lucky...  Yeah, I figure Urban Legend with this one cause nobody in there right  mind would write this down as history...  funny thing is?  The Legends are just beginning... We got a whole Mythos to write here.  Keep your eyes peeled and your ears perked for the sounds and sights of the Spliff, cause we intend to have fun, and you never<BR>
know...  you might be lucky enough to see the fabled boat pulling into your docks...  and better yet...  You might een get o see The Captain, The King, and the Admiral...  and better still...  You might get to have one of the best drinks in Voletta while doing it.  So, here this fable ends, only to cntinue with yet another volley of decadence and wild fun, let the satyrs and nymphs of Voletta carry you off in the dream boat "Spliff"<BR>
<BR>
	See ya kiddies... <g><BR>
