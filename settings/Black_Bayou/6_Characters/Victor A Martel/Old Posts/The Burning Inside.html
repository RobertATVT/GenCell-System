	It was dark outside.  <BR>
<BR>
	The skies were coated with a thick layer of clouds that hung like an oppressive gloom over the island.  He could feel a small trickle of liquid running down his cheek as his eyes drifted lowly to his hands.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="0"><BR>

<BR>
	Blood was splattered across his hands and forearms, small amounts but enough for his mind to register the consequences.  Once again, in agonizing lethargy his eyes moved to the body wracked with spasms in front of him, the life kicking free from the man that Damian held.<BR>
<BR>
	The life he just took.<BR>
<BR>
	"NO!" his voice cried out, the still night air shattered in it's slumbering peace by his outcry.  He sat up and looked at his hands, and blood-soaked set of clawed finger clenched in the darkness.  He was covered in sweat, the sheets pressed against his body like a layer of skin unshed.<BR>
<BR>
	"Victor!  Wake up ... it's all right baby ... it was just a dream."  Ceile's voice helped to lull him back to reality, the blood on his hands began to rise and fade away like a crimson steam.  The clean, manicured fingers were once again his.  Free of murderous talons, free of innocent blood.  She was holding him, her face pressed to his like a mother comforting a child who's sleep was shattered by the darkest of revelations.<BR>
<BR>
	"It's not just a dream Ceile.. I wish I could claim that." <BR>
<BR>
	His voice was broken and filled with grief and anguish, his eyes still locked onto his hands as if he's expecting the claws to break free once again.  He sat there for moments that stretched on and on, like a museum tour through guilt.  His mind ran through that day over an over, the shock, the grief, the agony ... he had only hit him once.  One punch to the chest was all it took to send his spirit fleeing into the afterlife, to remove this innocent man from the cycle.  His promise to God broken, his honor and integrity thrown into the gutters of Voletta.  <BR>
<BR>
	He was Cursed.<BR>
<BR>
	Days he'd spent in Saint Michaels, praying for forgiveness, searching for an answer.  But none came, no voice creapt into his mind, no angel came to rescue him from his suffering, no radiant bath of light to ease his guilt ridden mind.  Each night was another face, each dream visited the screaming agony of his victims.  They all came to cast dread upon him while he slept, all of them getting their vengeance in his mind.  Phantoms cursed to wander his subconscious until he died.  He could no be redeemed, he could not shed this burden and let it pass into the fog of time.  He wasn't like Damian, he couldn't kill for sport or pleasure, he had a purpose.  He had a purpose.<BR>
<BR>
	Purpose, the justification for madness.<BR>
<BR>
	He leanded over and laid his head on Ceile's lap, curling his body against hers like a child seeking comfort in the radiant heat of a mothers love.  Her hands ran through is hot, sweat soaked hair, her voice soft and soothing and she leaned over to kiss his forehead.<BR>
<BR>
	"It's going to be alright Victor...  I love you." Maybe he was sent an Angel afterall.  His hands reached up to touch the fire kissed curls that brushed his cheek.  Every muscle in his body trembled, every sound in the night cried...<BR>
<BR>
	Murderer!<BR>
<BR>
	"I only hit him once... once... I don't even know his name... " his voice came out in a soft crackle.  His face was wet with sweat and tears, his chest wracked with trembling sobs.  A shadow of who he once was, an Alpha.  At one point in time he was the strongest on the isle, he was a man that many of the wolves revered for his strength and ferocity.  As one rogue wolf had told him, he was like a Legendry King, he was a Leader.  Now he was obsolete, a weak man driven to sobbing in the middle of the night who's lack of integrity and self centerdness drove away those closest to him.  He has become a hollow spiritless shell of his former self.  He could see it in his wife's eyes.<BR>
<BR>
	Pity.<BR>
<BR>
	Even as much as she tried to hide it, he could see the pity in her eyes.  He could see the shame everytime she looked at him.  He was once a strong man, once upon a time he cared not for consequence or measure.  He met each challenge head first, tearing through troubles with strength and determination, nothing could stop his resolve.  Her feelings about his turn towards the church in this time of need didn't set well with her, but she wouldn't pass judgement and she certainly wouldn't attempt to turn him from his chosen path.  There were few things he did that she wouldn't support, one of which was his endless hunger for death.  She never agreed with his taste for destruction, no matter how he justified it, no matter what cause and banner he lifted in it's name.  Maybe she saw this day coming, maybe this wouldn't be the end of his suffering.<BR>
<BR>
	Suffer.<BR>
<BR>
	How long can a man suffer? How long can a man be destroyed by his own inner hatred?  <BR>
