	He expected to wake up in Ceile's arms... all this madness of wolves living here in Europe like some secret society left behind him as a bad dream.  His body did ache a bit, just residual soreness... perhaps he slept wrong or Ceile dug her head into a nerve too hard making him lose feeling in his arm... come on, we've all been there before... waking up in the middle of the night with this incredible pain in your shoulder, no feeling in your arm, it just hangs there lifeless and unable to function in any capacity.  You sit there a while, wishing it to start feeling better, refusing to do the one thing that will solve the problem... wake up the woman you love that is at that very moment digging her blissfully sleepy head deep into your skin and cutting off not only the flow of blood to the appendage, but the very nerves that serve to give it life and feeling....  well that's all well and good, but if that was the case, why does it feel like he is being watched?  Is Ceile already awake an unaware of the pain he is in?  Just gazing on her sleeping husband with love and admiration...his eyes began to open, slowly the world around him began to take shape... the shape of.... a man?<BR>
<BR>
	He quickly sat up in bed and looked around, at first having no idea where he was at all...  his mind still covered with the webs of sleep... OUCH... holy crap... what was wrong with him?  His side felt like someone tried to rip off a chuck, his arms were covered in fresh pink skin, and his head felt like someone had just used it for an anvil.  His eyes wandered over to the man, he was half alseep and not even aware that Victor was awake... Jordan?  What in the hell was he doing here... in this... tent... with all this old stuff all around?  Spears, shields, armor, swords... what was all this crap?  Marie... was this Marie's tent?  No, too... too manly for that, her tent was plush and regal, he was in more... spartan and manly surroundings.  Gunnar?  He nearly jumped out of bed, looking to make sure there wasn't an ill tempered germanic next to him... his sudden movement and wheeze of pain awoke Jordan, who nearly fell out of the chair he was propped in.<BR>
<BR>
	"Jesus Victor... calm the hell down... I'm the one that's supposed to be all gun shy and scared here.  What's up?"  He looked around, half expecting more black wolves to spring out of nowhere... but there was nothing other than his older half brother standing there... mostly naked and amazingly healthy.<BR>
<BR>
	"Jordan... where am I? Why are you here?" Victor sat down and looked around, seeing a wooden cup with his name carved into it, some eating utensils with a wolf's head crest on them, plates with a wolf's head emblazoned over top of a warhammer down the center.  Now that he looked closely, everything here was specifically his size, or with his families crest on it.  He didn't own any of this stuff before.  Hell he was brought here naked and made to sleep in a briar patch in an old run down cottage with speghetti for a roof.  Speghetti... Italians...... Antoni.... he growled and tried to stand again, but the pain in his side ached and burned.  He took a deep breath and looked at Jordan, his face healed completely and he was wearing the same archaic style of dress the rest of the Conclave wore, but his hair was a tangled mess of dredlocks, and his ears were pierced... no bad dream... this was unfortunately as real as life could get.<BR>
<BR>
	"You're in that... Conclave thing... whatever the hell that's supposed to be.  You're also in your tent in this "Conclave" thing... after the battle... after I saved your big hairy backside I should remind you.  They carted you off like some long lost hero and erected this pavillion in your favor.  Since then they've been pouring in with gifts, all day and night I get to sit up listening about how great the Martels are... how wonderful our family line has been since it's beginning.  Then I have to remind these simple creatures that I am only half Martel and I only saved you so that you could fly me back home and I could get out of this wolf pit.  But noooo... seems that Antoni had some crazy *ability* to cause wounds so ferocious that it even took your kind of freak almost forever to heal.  We've been here for six and a half weeks now while you lay on your butt and get better, and I have to listen over and over again about your kind and your family."  His arms crossed his chest as he stood up and began walking towards the door of the tent.<BR>
<BR>
	"Thank you Jordan, thank you for saving my furry butt.  Thank you brother."  Victors voice was calm... why fght the madness after all, he'll just sit it out until he wakes up from this menagerie.  He surely didn't expect the reaction from Jordan that he got, and he sat there wide eyed and mouth open.<BR>
<BR>
	"What do you know about brothers?  I came to you for help because my mother died, my sister is a druggy in some college some place, and our father is dead.  What do I get?  Some big furry jackass that talks in peoples heads and likes to gather all his friends around... who let me remind you, are also a bunch of big fuzzy werewolves..... and play "Sscare the normal guy"!  You, are a freak... you are unnatural and an abomination.  I can't believe I though I could come to you for help... but did our father say "goto your big hairy wolfhead flee ridden butt sniffing peeing on the carpet brother in America if you ever need help"? NO! He said that I have a half brother in America that would help me... didn't say what half!  Now I get beat up, drug BACK to Europe, stuffed in a sack and carried around by more furbutts, after they give me my daily serving of butt kicking, then have a knife put to my throat by some grease drinking pasta neck, only to have to svae you from getting your butt pulled through your shoulders... what's next?  You gonna tell me that Unlce Mo is a vampire?"  He took a deep breath and looked at Victor... desperately needing answers and it showed in his eyes.<BR>
<BR>
	Victor just looked at him for a few moments, he was mildly depserate, definately afraid, and it looks like he hasn't slept well at all this past month and a half. <BR>
<BR>
	"Jordan, please come and sit with me, I need family here more than ever.  We are all we have in this place.  I might be different, I might not even be human, but the blood that flows through me flows through you just as strong.  We may have seperate mothers, but our fathers blood flows heavily in both of us and you are as much Martel as I am.  I'm not asking you to accept me as some furbutt, but I would hope that you could come to accept me as your brother, as family, as our fathers son."  He had hoped for some resolution,but Jordan simply threw the door to the side and stepped half outside.<BR>
<BR>
	"Your fan club approaches mighty Hero." his tone sarcastic as he walked from the pavillion, Victor strained to get up but it was useless... he closed his eyes for a second, hearing the footsteps approach and one set enter.<BR>
<BR>
	"Victor, are you awake?" Marie's voice split the silence like a small sliver of sunlight cutting through the morning air.  He opened his eyes and looked to her, dressed once again in the sheerest white cloth draped across her body in true ancient greco-roman style.  Ceile... he had to think of Ceile... and the children all alone and worried about him in Barcelona.<BR>
<BR>
	"Yes Marie, I'm awake... finally.  We need to speak... I need to return home to my family and send Jordan wherever he needs.  I've been here too long already.  I th..." His voice was cut off, by Marie touching his lips with her finger in true motherly fashion.<BR>
<BR>
	"Victor, I have travelled your trail back to Spain... I took word of your condition to your family myself.  Your family waits for you, and your beautiful wife cried when she heard that you were still alive, though she never doubted otherwise." She smiled and pulled her finger away, kissing the tip of it where it had thouched his lips.  "I will miss you dearly Victor, as we all will."  Her head turned and her glance moved to Gunnar and Marcus standing there with two other black haired people, one male, and two females.  Gunnar stepped forward with a bundle wrapped in black velvet.<BR>
<BR>
	"We will all miss you Victor, and we hope that you will join us next Conclave.  Bring your pack, bring all your people that you trust... all are welcome if they are half as honorable as you are. My pups have spent some great deal of time looking for these for you, something for you to wear as you rejoin the world you live in." He untied the small knot at the top of the bundle and the velvet fell away to reveal a set of clothes and a longcoat...  the longcoat fashioned in an archaic styling, yet put together with a modern cut.  The pants were black, as was the shirt... all of it looked italian made.  Victor chuckled as he took them and smiled at Gunnar.<BR>
<BR>
	"Thank you friend, I will wear them with pride." He set the clothes down beside him and looked at the other three that stepped up to him, they were all carrying something wrapped in more black Velvet.  The male got to his knees and held his bundle out, Victor recognized him as one of the Hunted, and nodded to him as the man lowered his head in submission.<BR>
<BR>
	"You bested my alpha, and rightfully so... you fought with dignity, honor, valor, strength, and wisdom.  You were right, and he was a traitor to us all... we forever hold no grudge against your line and you may call on us if you ever find yourself in need.  I have become Alpha of the Reclaimed, to take my Father's seat in the Conclave and make right the wrongs that were done.  Most likely my entire life will be spent in this effort, but I will spend it and I can only hope to be a mere shadow of what you have shown to us." His fingers nervously tugged at the knot and the wrappings fell o the side revealing a book.  It was bound in black leather and edged in golden trim.  On the center was a golden wolfs head, and the pages must have been an old parchment.<BR>
<BR>
	"This is our history, I have spent the last six weeks scribing it for you.  It is the compilation of our laws and how we came to be.  Please use it with wisdom, and keep it safe for us all, so that we shall live on in the new world." He spoke the words and no sooner rose and stepped back, head still bowed.  The oldest of the two women stepped up and kneeled next to Victors bed... Victors face was getting blushed by all the hub bub... he wasn't royalty, he wasn't a hero... he was nothing more than what Antoni had called out... he was a monster.. nothing more.  But he would let them have their revelry, and their ways.<BR>
<BR>
	"Victor, I am Lucinde... new blooded Alpha of the Healing Way.  We thank you for freeing us from the shackles that we were bound into and giving us a new choice for our lives. For that we offer you this humble token of our gratitude.  Keep this as a reminder of your victory, and if you feel corruption enter your life, look upon it as a reminder of what you might become."  Her eyes were cold as steel, and there was not only admiration there, but the calm of a surviver.  She pulled back the wrapper and there sat the prepared and tanned fur and head of a black wolf.  Surely it wasn't the black wolf he though it was... but even if so.. it was a punishment suited for his deeds.  Finally the youngest girl stepped forward and boldly sat on the edge of the bed, her face was precious and beautiful... so out of place for the past events.  She couldn't be older than sixteen, so young to be brought into this war... but there she sat, hair wreathed in flowers and a light tunic about her.<BR>
<BR>
	"As the new Alpha of the Childrens Song pack... I, Selene would like to thank you for avenging the misjustice that was done to my pack.  Children should not be used as an instrument of war and I'm afraid that some of us will never regain the innocence that was lost that night.  We don't have books, furs, or fancy clothes to give you.  We just brought you this, take it and give it to your wife, some amount of beauty to help ease her worries when times are dark.  They will never grow old, and their beauty will never fade, like her's it will live on to be a blessing to you and your children." With that she leaned forward and kissed his cheek, and pulled out a handfull of flowers from behind her back, and holding them out to him like children do.  Her smile nearly healed him completely all by itself, and he reached forward and hugged her... his eyes welling at her innocence and beauty.<BR>
<BR>
	"Thank you all, I don't feel that I deserve this honor and praise, but I'll not cheapen your happiness and thanks.  I'll never forget any of you, and I will gladly return to you all.  Thank you so much... " <BR>
<BR>
	He left them there, children of the woods all gathered together to see him and Jordan on their way.  Dressed and taken to the outskirts of some Austrian village, they could manage from there and get home.  They stood at the edge of the woods and waved, smiled, cried, cheered... all manner of farewells were said and the two set out... time to go home.  Time to take the flowers of a childs innocence to his wife.<BR>
