<B>Sept. 27th 2013<BR>
Hall of Kings Compound, Voletta<BR>
9:15pm</B><BR>
<BR>
	A figure sat in the darkness of the damp hall, water dripping in the distance filling the air with the sound of its repetitive madness.  Nobody noticed it though, the large dome shaped structure long ago setup like a visiting chamber for kings.  Tall statues placed around the circular chamber as reminders of a lineage, and a huge chair at the head of the hall dwarfed by the statue of a wolfen man.  The statue holding a huge maul aloft in the air triumphantly over the makeshift throne.  Gloom clings to every corner of the hall, the high ceilings crossed with stone arches which support a massive light, broken and dead for years now, it hangs as a reminder of the loss.<BR>
<BR>
	The white beast sits slumped in the throne, the great Hammer resting on the floor held by the creature.  Wolfen head looking to the floor, the figure nearly as motionless as the statues that surround him.  Memories flood through his mind again, as they always do when the Creature that once was Victor Martel sits here in this mock of history and success.  The madness brought on by the war and the betrayal of his pack and that of his sire, he had already gained the full control over his beast before all of this war began, but now he simply cannot bring himself from it.  His only comfort through all of this has been Rya, someone who has felt the grief along with him, someone who suffered the same loss.  The bones of victims, the teeth and fingers that he now wears like a trophy around his neck, the skull he bats around out of boredom ... the remains of Malcom McVey and others that had foolishly joined with the Dark ones.  Soon the betrayer will be displayed for all to see, his death brought slow and painful, brought closer with each new valiant warrior that falls before the Dark Ones, his will be an existence of misery and he will still have Hell to look forwards to.<BR>
<BR>
	A small sound filters through the darkened haze of his memories, the sound is very familiar, it's the signal created by his Son that he is approaching...  His adopted son Lex.  His Blood children killed before they changed, the twins killed by the Dark Ones and his namesake taken and created into one of them, later to be killed by his fathers hand.  This war would leave him a shattered inhuman thing that would perish at Wars End.  Lexi was all he had left, always faithful, always by his side and loyal to a fault.  Lexi Cried with him as Little Vic's body crumbled away ... the only remnants were the ivory fangs, those too kept as a reminder...<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>       Lexi walks in, smooth as night and silent as death to stand near the brooding form of his father,sifu, and mentor Victor Martel.  Clad in leathers, urban primitive, tribal tattoo's and piercings dotting his form as he were now a living work of art.  Sniper rifle over his shoulder as well as the metallic warclub, backup pistol in the small of his back, sidearm and assault weapon slung in quick draw holsters.  His face stoic and unmoving, almost in a zenlike state.<BR>
<BR>
        He stood there, motionless as his father, mirroring his moods and demeanor; he had become the hunter and his prey was anyone that Vic or Rya chose for it to become. His heart had become like the stones and bones that decorated his neck, a trophy and relic of his numerous kills; much like the American GI's had in Vietnam. He had continued this age old practice, count growing as time went on; soon it would hold no more grisly trophies and needs be replaced with a new one.<BR>
  <BR>
    The test of time had come upon him in an odd way, the wounds physically had been etched upon his diminutive form only to slowly fade with time; his regenerative qualities denying him something yet again. He was to all appearances the same as the day he was brought into the Martel pack. As if time was naught to him,though his form was now much bulkier;a lean suppleness akin to a great jungle cat. His humor there, but dormant; more likely now to come out in some truly sick and perverse manner...a new way to kill someone and yet to humiliating way.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
	As his son enters the chamber his large wolfen rises to look at him, his eyes grieving for the loss in innocence that this war has caused on his once humor filled and loving son.  His mind reaches out to link with that of his son, the language created for the wolfen forms difficult and too timely for his patience right now.  Finally the tendrils of his mind clasp with that of his son and their thoughts flow to each other easily.<BR>
<BR>
	"I have your next target son," his lean muscles lift the massive body from the throne to move to a steel panel set into the wall filled with mired blinking lights.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	"As you wish father, who is the lost soul to be then?"  Sinuous movements carry him to follow his father to the panel, the short brutal body moving quietly and watching him.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
	Taloned fingers press a few buttons and light flows from the holographic image generator, the form of Blake Exavior stands in miniature beside Victor.  A low growl rumbles in his chest as the communication of thoughts continues.  The image of the Betrayer bringing memories of Laura's death to vivd reality, her body crushed and battered, pinned standing to the wall by a silver spike filling the bullet wound where Blake killed her, right after turning numerous Wolves over to the Dark ones and fleeing town with the money they paid him.<BR>
<BR>
	"The Betrayer has returned to Voletta, I want you to drop him and bring him to the hall for judgment and punishment" The silence of the chamber broken by the hum of the generator and the maddening drops of water.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	"You wish the betrayer alive?"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
	"I want him however you feel like bringing him, but I want him to be made an example, yes, however close to death however is for you to decide.  I reserve the slaying, however."<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"I will show him some of the pain he has inflicted, drag him back here after breaking a few bones and scalping him.  The worm will face your judgment father."  His face grim, the light of cold vengeance burning deep in them.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"So be it" This was all that needed to be said, Lex was loyal and would do exactly as he asked, and he had never failed Vic before.  Never would while he drew breath.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>With a quick step Lex moves before Victor and kneels before him offering his warclub in both hands for Victor to bless it and give him power for his mission.	"I will only use this, my claws and teeth, and the gifts that our Mother Gaia and Luna have permitted me to be blessed with, Bless this mission father and send me out with your power"<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Tears of pride begin to well in the creatures eyes as he stands looking down on his son, so much like him ... so full of honesty, valor, honor, and loyalty.  The time was right for the father to pass on the final gift to his son, and the taloned hand snakes behind the throne to pull forth a maul made exactly like the one he carries, only smaller.  Made for his son, and the warclub is removed and the hammer placed in his upheld hands instead.  Linked minds activate again "Carry this with you my son, this is yours, The Hammer of Vengeance and bring down the Betrayer,"<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Lexi's eyes mist over as he opens them to see the Maul in his hands, his heart leaping to his throat as his minds seeks out his fathers.  "You do me great honor father and I will see to it that your wishes become a reality.  I will strike down from the very heavens above, Swift and sure will be my hands and fire in my eyes.  Wrath and Rage are my companions and righteousness is my cause"<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>"You make your mother and father proud, Gaia is with you and Vengeance is ours" His voice finally breaks the silence as Lex backs away moving into the shadows and summoning the wolfen spirit around him, making him vanish from mortal eyes.<BR>
