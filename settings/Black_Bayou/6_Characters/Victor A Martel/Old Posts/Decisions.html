	Decisions are never easy, especially the ones that a pack Alpha has to make...  especially when you have a fistful of pups that are hard headed and tough to manage.  I mean, I tell them what to expect, I lead them kindly and with respect.  What do I get though?  Nada.  I spent a whole night while in terrbile pain from the fire telling Raven what to expect and what was coming up.  I warned her that night what would happen, but you know what I get? <BR>
"You never told me anything, you left me aloe in the woods, you this, you that... ".  Yeah, I left her in the woods, like I left them all, that is our way isn't it?  They have to be strong enough to survuve, they have to make it on their own, that is who we are.  Nobody walked back and carried me out of the woods.  We just don;t do that.<BR>
<BR>
	If that isn't bad enough, last full moon she goes apenuts and pops Horus in the Symposium parking lot and acts like there was nothing wrong...  what does she expect?  I told her to control herself or to run her backside away from there and to some place secluded...  But nooo... that was too easy.  That would have been the right thing to do.  I mean, what did she expect me to do, let her rampage across the lot and hurt innocent people?  I drive my<BR>
pups into having their first change raging on me so that innocent people aren;t hurt, I give myself to their rage for the safety of Voletta.  So what did I do?  I beat her unconscious so nobody was hurt too bad.  Now I am a cold, careless, Evil man.  I told her that if she did loose control that I would have to do it... and it happened.  And what did her stubborness get her?  Locked in jail with another packmate that did nothing but try and help us<BR>
out and was then driven to lose control by the Cadet hero Nate.<BR>
<BR>
	Now I hear that while she is in jail she has nothing better to do than talk about what a monster I am....  Yeah right.  I go out of my way to help any who needs it.  I feed the poor at the Dojo, I give homes to those who have none regardless of how temporary, they still end up having a place to crash.  I give free self defense and martial arts classes at the Dojo... I even died saving eight people from a burning building.  Now does that sound like a<BR>
monster?  Nahh...  <BR>
<BR>
	Let her have her delusions, maybe I was the one who made the mistake, maybe for once being nice bit me right back in the keister...  Maybe being nice has gone too far.  Oh, but I am also a nit-wit that doesn't realize who I have in my pack...  I realize that I have a good pack except for one dangerous mistake.  I love each of my packmates, and would give my life for them... heck I already have matter of fact... they have all sated their rage with my<BR>
flesh and blood.  Ah, but who cares right?  Victor Martel is nothing but a cold hearted, cheap, cheating, low blow taking, ruthless, uncaring, pathetic mistake.  Someone who doesn't deserve the wolf spirit given to him, a thorn in the side of his grandsire.   He has no control, he is a vile cheater who takes advantage of people and their weaknesses and cares for nobody but himself...  Power, that is what I am after....  Yeah, you go ahead and believe<BR>
all those press releases, but when you are down on your luck, when you need a friend or a bite to eat...  the Shao Tei Tung Dojo is always open, and always has a place for ya.  That is the fact...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B></I><BR>
