Small changes mostly, most people woudn't notice a small photo here, a new arrangement of flowers, or the more subtle details that go in the transfer of control of the Dojo from one person to the other.  Victor noticed though, he could smell the changes.  He sat the baggage down for a moment, and took in the scenery, his mind mulling over the uneasy feeling that he wasn't sure he was glad to even be here.<BR>

	It started after the Protectorate came to town, most people hardly noticed the presence of the new strangers, others conveniently forgot.  Victor wouldn't forget however, the visage of the Dying Wolf Hunter was still fresh in his mind... it hung there like an old tapestry.  The same hunter that had killed Jason's wife, and had his head delivered in a like manner to Jason.  Silver Platter Service all te way.  He's killed before, don't get the picture misconstrued here, but for some reason these events dug deeper than anything had affected him before.  What kind of people gun down a child that's barely 1 year old?  Yet another haunting memory, he has so many... ghosts flying around everywhere he turns.  That's why he went away, that's why he went back to his birthplace.  To see his mother, to take his children to safety, away from the corruptive hellish den named Voletta.  Such a sleepy little town, yeah right.<BR>

	A shake of the white maned head brings him back to reality and the bags are once again grabbed and carried upstairs.  His solemn steps sound quietly up the boards to his loft, his home... slow steps.  Each step wrings his gut into a knot, each sound fo the footfall resounds in his keen ears, and is matched by a surge of blood through his body.  Each surge of blood threatens to blacken his vision, the anxiety grows and his mind begins to race.  Will there be anyone to even greet him?  The Great Alpha, the Father, the Husband, the Betrayer, the Cold Blooded Murderer, the Homewrecker, the Liar, the Failure... The Lie.</B></I></HTML>
