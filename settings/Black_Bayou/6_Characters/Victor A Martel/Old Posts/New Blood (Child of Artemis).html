	Mellina heard the phone ring, and set down the copy of The Tao she'd been reading, reaching over for the phone and picking it up.  "Kyriakos residence, Mellina speaking."<BR>
	"Mellina, this is Vic... are you ready to do that drawing thing?"<BR>
	"Sure am...where should we meet?:<BR>
	"Would you like me to pick you up?  I know a nice place on the beach that was out of the way and kinda hard to give directions to, but I can take you there.  It won't be anything out of my way."<BR>
	"Sure, that'd be fine."  She gave him her address.  "I can have my things gathered up in a few minutes and be ready to go right away."<BR>
	"Wonderful...I'll see you there in a few minutes."  With that, he hung up and moved to the door, grabbing his Leather Longcoat, then headed out to the brand new Lamborghini LM002 outside.<BR>
	She hung up the phone and set the book aside, rising from her seat on the futon that doubled as couch and bed to grab her art bag and a blanket, then slid her bare feet into sandals.  Before long, the quiet Hummer-like ATV pulled up in front of her pad, and the horn was loosed in a single quick tap; he stepped out to open her door for her.  She locked the door behind her as she stepped out, smiling at him serenely as she moved down the sidewalk to the vehicle, loose smock and cotton drawstring pants comfortable for the temperatures.  "Good to see you again."<BR>
	"The pleasure is all mine... you look lovely as usual."  He smiled as he waited by the open door for her to get in and settled.  She slid into her seat and fastened the seatbelt, settling bag and blanket on her lap, then smiled up at him.<BR>
	"And you are as charming and dashing as ever, Victor."<BR>
	He smiled and winked at her as he hopped in his side, the vehicle much more comfy for his abnormal size, and looked at the bundle.  "Care for me to put that in the back for you?  And thank you, I'm a bit of a flirt, I admit."<BR>
	She chuckled calmly.  "I can carry it; it's not heavy.  And yes, I realize you are...it's just fortunate for you that I'm immune."  She winked mischievously.<BR>
	"Unfortunately, the is no true immunity, so I will just have to try harder." He turned to face her, his eyes sparkling and full of mischief as well, perfect teeth bright in the dark night, and his eyes flashing with a deep green radiance as the light catches them a certain way...very much like a wolf's eyes.<BR>
	A soft laugh rose from her lips and she just shook her head in wry amusement.  "You're welcome to try, I can't stop you...but I hope you take disappointment well."  He was, after all, a married man, she reminded herself, and she was not one to poach.  She raked a few stray locks of black-cherrywine silk out of dark-forest eyes and nodded as the vehicle pulled away.<BR>
	"Ahhh... how you wound me fair goddess...so unmatched, am I?  So mortal in the presence of beautiful divinity... solamente los cielos llevan más maravillas que sus ojos."  The car was put into gear and slowly moved through the street as the radio kicked into a soft techno ballad.  Lush lips curled in a smile as she tries to puzzle out his final words--Japanese and Greek she had command of, but not Spanish--and finally gave up, listening to the music with an appreciative ear as he drove.  "Only the heavens carry more wonders than your eyes... that was what I said."  His eyes flashed like they were backlit by green neon as the streetlights caught them and his eyes studied the road.  Occasionally he looked over at her and smiled.<BR>
	"Ever the charmer."  The fingers of her right hand tapped out a rhythmic cadence against the door's frame, hand trailing along the exterior of the vehicle through the rolled-down window, and she smiled in response, then added a fluid, darkly-lilting chain of syllables at the end of the sentence.<BR>
	"You do know, that if I was single I would be all about you, you know that right?"<BR>
	One finely-drawn dark amber brow archeed slowly, and she half-turned in her seat to watch him, almost able to feel the surge of hormones that could link her to him with a single electric shock.  "You realize if you were single I'd be sitting in your lap right now and this car wouldn't be being driven, though it might well be rocking?"<BR>
	He smiled and chuckled.  "Fascinating...  too bad you left when you did."  He nodded and looked at her with a more serious look on his face.<BR>
	"I trust the Universe to guide me along the path I am destined to take.  If that means a lover or a mate, then it will happen for me in the time and place that was right for such a thing, and all my chasing after it will not bring it to me an instant sooner than it was -supposed- to be."  She nodded serenely, quite calm, quite assured.<BR>
	"Universe huh?  I don't believe in that fate crap... I think you have to go out and take what you want and who you want... I think you make your own destiny."<BR>
	"That's true to a certain extent...certainly I don't simply sit around and let the Universe do my paintings for me.  But there are some things that are simply beyond our control.  We do not state when we're born, for example; that's decided for us.  And so too when we die, in the end.  As for love...  she looked thoughtful I've seen a lot of men and women both rush themselves into unhappy relationships because they'd convinced themselves they weren't complete without a lover.  I know I'm complete just as I am; I don't need another person to complete me.  If and when I find someone, that'll be wonderful...but I'd rather take my time and make sure rather than rush into something with someone I barely know who'd turn out to be all wrong for me."<BR>
	A deep chuckle emitted from his throat.  "Well for the dying bit...  I'll choose my end days thank you very much...  and I don't validate myself by who I'm with either... though I am loyal... I'm still a animal like anyone else... and we make mistakes."<BR>
	She smiled, warming to the conversation; it's been a while since she'd found anyone with whom she could have philosophical debates, after all.  "How do you choose your end days? Oh, I know you can stay away from dangerous situations, eat well, all that...but how do you know that you might not get hit by a car tomorrow night, or develop cancer five years from now?  Some things you just can't control."<BR>
	"I'll never get cancer... I've not had as much as the sniffles for over a year... and if you hit me with a car...well, did I mention that I've been in a horible car crash and had 3rd degree burns over 99% of my body.   I was pronounced dead for 35 minutes and then got better?  If you look closely at me you will se tiny scars all over my skin...that was caused by being tortured in a POW camp in Kosovo for three weeks.  I'm hard to kill."<BR>
	She blinked at that, rather startled by the long list.  "Your health and constituation are...admirable.  How on earth did you survive such a crash?"  Not getting colds was one thing; she can claim the same.  But she could hardly claim that she could survive the burns he described, nor the torture, much less being pronounced dead for that long, then simply getting up and walking away.<BR>
	"I refuse to stop... I made a vow years ago that I would repay a debt, and until that debt was repaid, I refuse to die... I refuse to let anything stop me.  Granted, I spent a few weeks in intensive care...  and even when I got burned up and nearly died pulling people from a burning building... it still wasn't my time.  There was a trick to it, more than just an overwhelmingly stubborn will to live... but you wouldn't believe me... you probably think that I'm a delusional crackhead as it was."<BR>
	She arched a brow, then shook her head.  "Medical records could be checked, I'm sure.  You wouldn't lie to me when it'd be so easy to find out and prove or disprove what you say."  Fascinated now, she turned wholly toward him, curious; she had spent many years honing her body to become a fine tool, many years in which diet and exercise combined to keep her in near-perfect health, but even so, she was subject to the occasional sprain or flu bug.  Her dark eyes gleamed with curiosity.  "Tell me more."<BR>
	"Very true, I have the records at the loft...  kinda like a memorial to life.  I could share the secret with you, but it's more than a diet... a vow...it's a total change in life.  you will never be the same and the secret will overwhelm you and drive you to bouts of near madness.  It's a combination of religion, rituals, belief, and control.  It's not for the weak.. and it's suredly not for the timid."<BR>
	"I am neither weak nor timid...and so long as the change doesn't involve anything illegal, nor drugs--neither of which I could believe you'd stoop to--then I'm interested, to say the least.  She pauses As for the secret...well...there was nothing in life that controls me; I control myself...and I fear no madness."  She was confident in herself and of her abilities, but calm--not arrogant.  "Can you tell me more, or show me?"<BR>
	With a rather sharp turn, he took the LM002 off the road and onto the beach with a few bounces;  she was thrown towards him and then he straightened and headed over the beach, away from the town.  A hand lifted and caught her preternaurally, and he looked deeply into her eyes, hand sliding through the loose silk of her hair.  "Are you sure you really want to know?  This secret <B><I>Will</B></I> drive you to madness... it <B><I>Will</B></I> test every ounce of control you have...  and you <B><I>Will</B></I> lose to it... it will tear at you and fill you with a rage that you have never before felt...  and it will drive you to a violent fury.  And only death can relieve you."<BR>
	She must pause, then, to consider this; not out of uncertainty or hesitation, but simply because it would be unwise to rush into any decision without proper reflection on the simple truth that she might, indeed, fail.  She was confident in her abilities--but as she pointed out to him herself, there were some things that were simply beyond one's control.  Could she face this thing, and fail, and eventually perhaps master it?  And could she live with herself if she could not?  She pondered it for a moment, peripherally aware of his hand laced through her hair, and finally looked up at him and nodded, her curiosity--that one sole driving flaw--too great to turn away.  "I want to know."<BR>
	"Very well, let me warn you; to my knowledge, I am the only person that has ever truly mastered the secret."  Finally, the vehicle slowed and pulled into a small grove of beach; tall trees loomed over it in a near ring and small tiki torches ringed the area.  "We're here."  With a wink, he opened the door and swooshed out, going to the rear of the vehicle and popping it open, pulling out several easles and pads of paper, and a small trunk tucked under his arm.  She slipped out of the vehicle, bag slung over her shoulder and the blanket under one arm, and waited for him to lead the way.  He pushed past the brush to the clearing and moved to light the torches.  "This was my little secret place...pretty, isn't it?"<BR>
	"Very nice.  The sound of the ocean is soothing."  She glanced at the flickering flames of the torches for a moment, then set her bag down before spreading the blanket out on the sand to sit on.<BR>
	"So who shall start?  Shall I draw you first or shall you draw me?"  >>Or shall we get down to the secret?<<   His eyes focused on her, once again gleaming and glowing in the lights as he set up.<BR>
	She lifted her head to stare at him, having pulled the sketchpad, pencils, and charcoals out of her bag.  The MS was no shock, she had heard it from others before, but one dark amber brow arched as she watches him set up.  "I think it's my turn to play model...I've been the artist for long enough.  And then...the secret."  Her eyes offer up a questioning glance, as if wondering if her choice meets with his approval.<BR>
	"Very well..."  He stepped behind the drawing board and got his charcoals and pencils ready.  "As soon as you are ready pretty one.  This is perfectly fine with me."<BR>
	She nodded and set her own art supplies aside, then kicked off her sandals and curled up on the blanket in a casual pose, comfortable enough to hold for a while in case his sketching should take any length of time.  She looked up, watching him, dark-fire hair spread out on the blanket, and nodded.  "Ready."<BR>
	He looked at her with a mischievous gleam in his eyes and shrugged.  "Not exactly what I was hoping for, but I will manage... Turn your head just a bit this way..."  He motioned with his one hand as the other was already at work, pulling the line of her long tapered neck across the paper and moving on, changing areas as new places of her body caught his eyes and inspired him.  Mellina turned her head in the direction he indicated, a light smile on her face, quite comfortable on the blanket.  After about 10 minutes, Victor looked at his sketch and stepped back, judging it, then turned it to face her.  The picture sketched was a rough of her laying as she was, with wolves all around her, one of them lounging across her lap; a large white one behind her looked protective and rather fierce.  "What do you think?"<BR>
	"It's lovely...you're an excellent artist."  She sat up a little straighter, then tilted her head curiously.  "The addition of the wolves was interesting...you must be very good to draw them from memory like that.  Where did you see them, to practice sketching them?"  She  was fairly sure there was no zoo closer than New Orleans.<BR>
	"I see them all the time dear...now, your turn and the secret.  We can do this all at once if you'd like; just whatever happens, don't be afraid and don't worry.  You are safer now than you may have ever been in your life.  Promise?"<BR>
	She nodded, and gave him a quiet smile, that confidence in her own skills making her quite serene.   "I'm not worried, and I promise.  I'm ready."<BR>
	He chuckled, hoping she wouldn't freak out.  The longcoat was removed, showing the rippling muscles under the tight t-shirt, which was then pulled over his head as his shoes were kicked away and his hands moved to the waistband of the tight leather pants.  With one quick look over his shoulder, he asked her once more.  "You sure you want to know?"<BR>
	Her gaze, flickering quickly over his naked form, was appreciative, but somehow she sensed that he had not brought her all the way out here and built up a story about a big secret just to get naked in front of her, so she nodded.  "I'm sure. Whatever it is...show me."<BR>
	He dropped the pants and stepped away from them, then began to change into the fierce white wolf in the drawing, his body shrinking in spots, growing in others, a fine white fur sprouting all over him.  When the change was over, he turned to face her.  Her eyes were wide, very wide...but not with fear, only with wonder.  She sat very still, lips parting in an amazed, silent, "Oh."  She had seen it, yet she could barely believe the evidence of her senses--yet, if she could not believe her eyes, what ccould she believe?  At last, she reached out with one hand to touch him, hardly daring to believe this was real.<BR>
	His backside dropped into the sand and the large wolven head tilted to the side, her fingers stretching to his fur; he moved a bit closer to her.  >>This is the cute side of what I am.  There's a much more horrifying aspect as well...shall I show it to you as well?<<  Her only response was a silent nod, feeling the silken plush of that snowy fur, and a half-mused, desperate wish for a camera.  But it was his secret, not hers, and photos are out of the question--even unknowing, she knew this much.  With a wolfish smile, he nuzzled against her thigh and then stepped back again.  His body began to change once again, and it grew to immense size, that of the Horus Wolf, the creature of Rage and anger.  In most, there was an unintelligent hate in the eyes of the beast, but in Victor there was a serene control, a firm grip on what he was, and he looked down on her, standing calm and white.  >>This is the form of rage.  None other than I have learned to master it and control it...when angered you will be likely to turn to this and desire to kill... this is the flipside of the pretty wolf, this is the test of wills.<< <BR>
	And now, recognition snapped into her eyes, and her mouth dropped open in surprise as she saw in him a mirror of the thing she fought on the beach months ago and defeated with her bare hands.  She will have to tell him about that later, she noted, but she nodded in answer to his mental speech, silently vowing that she must learn more about this.<BR>
	"If you want to know more about this, you must become my childe, my pup... you will join my family... my pack...  you become a Guardian."  The voice uttered was rumbling deep and gutteral, broken, and took intense concentration to form the words.<BR>
	"A Guardian..."  Her voice was dark, low, silken-soft.  "What do you Guard?"<BR>
	"Those who are weak, those innocent and good.  We pursue the destruction of villainous scum, and grant them no mercy."<BR>
	And with that, her eyes shone.  She had spent her life honing her body to be a perfect tool of battle; for what cause, she never quite knew.  It was the one missing piece of the puzzle that was her life...and now that missing piece of the puzzle fitted neatly into that last empty spot in her soul.  She rose from the blanket without a sound, nodding; why should she not use the skills she had trained at for so long in such a cause?  "I'm yours."<BR>
	"I told you, I choose when I die... I choose my fate, I forge my destiny with the Hammer of Justice, passed down my line from the first Martel.  Welcome..."  With that, he shifted back to the mortal form and couldn't help but grasp her by the hair and kiss her deeply.  "I'm glad to have you as one of mine, Mellina..."<BR>
	And something in her...just this once...forewent her strict code, and kissed him back, ever so briefly.  He had, after all, kissed her first...and she knew that there would not be another chance.<BR>
	With her acceptance, he walked to the small wooden trunk and opened it, pulling out several clay pots, then brought them over to her, then he looked at her and began building a fire.  "I need a little blood and you should remove your clothing.  What will occur is that when the ritual is over...in six hours or so... I will hunt you and bite you.  When the moon crests full after that, you will change.  You must be near me because your first shed blood will be mine or my Beta."<BR>
	"Very well."  She was already barefoot, and now reached up with dark hands to hook the hem of her shirt, pulling it off over her head in one easy tug, then dropping it on the ground.  The moonlight gleamed silver over her dark skin and in her darkfire hair, and her hands went next to the waistband of the drawstring pants she wore, untying the knot and shoving them down over her rounded hips, then stepping out of the pool of beige cotton that sat atop the blanket, standing naked before him.  There was a small knife in her art bag used for trimming brushes, and she used it to slice a tiny cut in her thigh for the blood he needed.<BR>
	After the fire was built and blazing, he grabbed the small pots of paint and began tracing glyph styled patterns across her flesh,  then marked his own in a similar fashion.  "Are you ready, Mellina?"<BR>
	"I'm ready, Victor."  Her gaze was steady now, calm, having made her decision and not about to back out.<BR>
	With a deep breath and an admiring look over her strong and well-built body, he moved to the fire and circle, his voice chanting low as he danced around it, and beckoned her to join him, his dance primal and rather fluid.  Before long, the sounds of ancient drums passed eerily from the woods and other long past voices joined his song.<BR>
	Ah...and now, this was something she could join in, easily; she raised her voice in a lilting cadence of liquid Greek notes, and moved to dance around the fire with him as her tones flowed forth in a song of praise to Artemis, goddess of the moon and the hunt, so often portrayed in Greek art as companioned by wolves.<BR>
	>>When I become the Horus, run...<<  Slowly as he danced, his appearance took on a more wolven appearance.<BR>
	It took six hours for such a thing to happen, but slowly, he changed.  And almost instinctively, her feet broke away from the circle around the fire and she tore off, heels and toes digging into the sand, her energies barely sapped by six hours of dancing.  If nothing else, her workouts had kept her fit, and her concentration was now totally focused on the hunt...and the chase.<BR>
	Victor's body finished changing, and for the first time, his hunt was more clear and controlled; he could smell her as he moved, large furred legs pounding against the sand, his hands used to increase his speed even more.  Before long, he could see her running ahead of him.  She breathed, arms and legs synchronized, eyes narrowed to slits, able to hear him cutting the distance that separated them.  A few more moments, and he was within distance to leap and knock her to the ground.  In slow motion, he saw his maw bite into her, teeth sinking in and holding her shoulder to let the greenish froth sink in and mingle with her blood.<BR>
	Then he was gone, running off into the brush.<BR>
	There was pain; but she had felt worse.  It burned, and she could feel something racing within her veins.  Above all, she knew she would never again be the same.</HTML>
