	Corporate Executives.  One has to wonder about how they manage to get where they are.  Sure, there are old adages about selling you soul to the devil, but is that far from the truth?  I know that the devil doesn't come to you in a red tuxedo with an old parchment contract and makes you sign it in blood.  I do think that there are small steps to how one would do it.  Take sleeping with your boss for instance, that is one way.  Other things that I am sure that you are smart enough to understand and know about.  My mind is rambling over things while I wait for the future Obituary to arrive at his home.  This pathetic piece of scum covered river sewage needs to be taught a lesson, he needs to know what he has done to other people.  Then he needs to be removed.  Oh please, don't give me that bleeding heart "He's just misunderstood" bull-garbage, or better yet the infamous "maybe he needs another chance".  I have his chance.... hangin.<BR>
<BR>
	Hangin... now that might work... make it look like a suicide while I watch him strangled, choking on his own saliva while he tries to force breath past the sheets.  Nah, I want to feel his flesh tearing underneath my claws.  I want to wear his blood while he watches it flowing onto my hands.  Yeah, that is what I want.  I'm sitting here waiting, my stomach is filled with butterlfies... dancing in glee.  Kinda like when you getting ready to go fishing with your dad, you know it will be a great time and you are soooo looking forward to it.  Not nervous as in fear, this guy will be two smacks minumum. Oh wait... what is that?  Could it be?  Yes it is the sound of a luxury sedan heading this way, and look... it is pulling into the driveway.  How grand, thi smakes me so happy.  I am almost shivering in glee, standing here unseen to any mortal eye.  I am just waiting to follow him through the door, then my fun will really begin.<BR>
<BR>
	Ah, like planned, so easily I slip in... the stupid filth left his door wide open while he went to get the paper from the front lawn, how pleasent of him.  A few steps and I am in his Foyer, at least that is what I am sure he calls this little tiled area in all his blue blooded uppityness.  Waiting for the perfect chance, oh... there it is, he just shut the door and turned on the lights.  Poof, out of the shadowed veil of my supernatural hidey-hole I come, and with the most minimal effort I wrap my hand around his face.  With a firm grip I clamp his jaw and lips shut, preventing anything more than a wide eyed whimper from escaping him.  The terror on his face was exhilerating, darn near made me giggle.  Another unnaturally quick movement and I had him by his belt and the hem of his pants and lifting him off the ground.  He was a sprig of a guy, no more than five foot, ten inches.  He was a little heavy, but you get that when you sleeze your way the top, by abusing people and walking on the efforts of others.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>His words are spoken softly, mumbled through the large mans fingers, half whispered and half thought. "Oh dear God help me, who is this?  What does he want with me?  Is it Sophia's boyfriend?  No, no... he is too tall... Oh God, why is he doing this?  I payed that guy his money back, it couldn't be him, that was too long ago.  Why would Mickey want to hurt me, I always buy from him, nobody else... so it can't be the drugs...  Please God, just this once hear me... please!  I am pissing myself, Oh dear God I am pissing myself, please don't let me die.... please don't let me die... please don't let me die."<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	The bottom feeder here is quietly mumbling and whispering prayers, how quaint.  Let him get all his prayers now, he needs them.  My question is this.  Does he really think that God doesn't see through this sham?  Praying only when he needs something?  Bah, he's going to hell, no Angels are going to waltz through that door and carry him to the happy places...  he is going down on a ship of guilt, greed, lust, envy, sloth, pride, gluttony... the only one I haven't witnessed this jerk commiting is wrath, and that is probably because he doesn't have the balls for it... well... judging by the trail across the floor, I would say he certainly has the bladder to make up for it.  Pathetic, truly pathetic. <BR>
<BR>
	"Go ahead and pray, it isn't going to help you in this life.  Maybe you will come back as something with a conscience."  My voice came out undecidedly cold and cruel, not that I minded of course.  Just didn't really plan it that way.  I will have to remember that sound, so I can do it again.  He tried to mumble something, but I clenched his jaw so tight I could almost feel impressions forming on the bone.  I despise this man.<BR>
<BR>
	"By the way, if you try to say anything above a whisper... I am going to keep you in pain and misery as I burn your body to ashes centimeter by centimeter, day by day.  I will of course keep you painfully alive and aware for this months to year long process.  You can count on that.  Now when I count to three...." A quick motion brings my gun to my hand and jabbinmg painfully into his eye "I am going to let go of your rediculous face and you are going to sit down... and remember, nothing above a whisper.  You know, about the volume you used when you told your secretary that it was time for her monthly evaluation in your office."<BR>
<BR>
	With that one warning I release him with a little shove by his face sending him crashing into his couch to crumble.  His hands immediately seek his head and he leans over to cradle his face, rocking back and forth.  He has to be planning something, some escape plan...  but they all do.  They all think they can get away.  Maybe he will.... Nah, he's a goner.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>His voice came across shakily, frightened, twisted cause he thought of a plan.  Money.  That has to be what this is all about.  I will pay him to not kill me.  If that doesn't work I will act like I am crying, then punch him in the nuts and run.  This []hole doesn't know who he is messing with.  I will have him thrown in jail for the rest of his life.  This stupid, street rabble.  This thug that thinks he can come in here and have his way.  How did he know about Sophia and my little codewords for... "how do you.. know about... Sophias Evaluation?"<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Oh this was rich, I couldn't pass this up if someone payed me Bill Gates' bank account.  I knew he would just flip with this one, so I walked ominously to the stereo and flipped it on, low enough to cover gasps and hushed whispers.  Then I locked his gaze and glared into his now red eyes... mine colored their brilliant green and fierce with the contempt I felt for him.  I moved like a hunter towards him with a cruel sneer on my face grabbing him by the shirt and raising him to his feet again.  A whimper let loose, like I knew it would... but here came the grand slam.  I brutally opened my mind to his, letting venom filled words pour forth into his thoughts >>Because I can hear your thoughts, I know your every sin.  I watch you through the walls, I hear your nasty little talks with her in the office.  I listen to your sickening threats to coerce her into touching your nasty little body.  And I have seen your 5 minutes of victory.  I hope it was worth it<<<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Scrambling backwards is all I could do, what is this thing?  This is no man.  How can he speak in my mind?  How does he really know?  Dear God he is really going to kill me.  I have to get away..  Oh God please, please save me... I will do anything, I will never speak to Sophia again, none of them, I swear.  <BR>
<BR>
	"If it is money that you want, I have a little over three thousand in my safe over there, please take it.  I won't do it again I swear, please don't kill me."  My voice rolled out frantic and sporadic... please let this end.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>To be continued....<BR>
<BR>
	Laughter filled the air as I followed the fearful executive crawling backwards on the floor crying pathetically.  I am sure that the look on my face was frightening, the gleem in my eye at the knowledge that this mans life rested in my hands.  I could kill him at any moment, any second, it would take nothing for me to change into the rage and rip his face off or disembowel him with my claws.  This wasn't about murder though, this wasn't about me getting my jollies over killing a defenseless wretch.... This was about Justice.  This mamby pampy SD justice is no better, they do the same trick.  I have heard about their prisoners "escaping" from custody.    Our prisons are over crowded, rapists and cold blooded murderers get off scott free because a glove "didn't fit"...  justice is a mockery in this country...  I think things need to change.<BR>
<BR>
	" You think this is about money?  You think that I am here to scare you into getting some quick cash or blackmail? " A menacing chuckle breaks free, menacing from the madness contained within.. "I'll tell you what, I will take your money, but only to make it look like a robbery.  I'm still going to kill you, just need to decide how.  How would you like to die Mr. Jenkins?  How would Sophis want you to die?  Now stop that, I know what you're thinking, no she didn't hire me to kill you.  I'm killing you because you forfeit your right to live when you degraded another human being... when you raped her.  Call it vigilante justice, the courts are corrupt and you would get away, so I am gonna make sure you pay.  Welcome to paybacks. "<BR>
<BR>
	The look on his face was priceless, raw fear and confusion.  The fear wasn't just from what I said, but from the unnatural speed as I snatched him up by his shirt.. he was a light guy, maybe weighing in at 150 lbs or less.  I was growing tired of this game, he was soiled and rather a pitiful sight, and even the self indulgent satisfaction that I was in total control of this mans life was stretching thin.  Then he did it, he made up my mind for me, all it took was a kick in the nuts.  Next thing I know the rage is coming, and I let it.  I used as much control over it as I could but his death was at hand.   A few swipes at him shredded his booth tanned skin across his chest in scarlet and pink ribbons.  The blood sprayed across the rages huge white fur covered chest and soaked the taloned fingers as they continued to rip into the soft flesh, shoving bones aside or breaking them out of the way...  The Rage dropped the man, who staggered back whimpering until his eyes rolled back into his head and he slumped into a heap on the floor.  Job done.  Cleanup time.<BR>
<BR>
	The carpet was gonna be tough, but luckily the guy had a carpet cleaner, so I cleaned it after rolling the jerk in some towel packed plastic thank heavens this jerkoff lived on the fringes of town and there were woods and scarce houses around.  After the carpet was cleaned and swept of all fur, hair, and fluids were stripped, a well placed with a utility knife allowed me to clean any mess under it... good, no padding, straight wood.  Leave it to a friggin yuppie to cover up a nice wooden floor with tacky carpet.  Ahh, all that's done, prints wiped from the doors and walls, and my shredded clothing picked up.  The next part would be tricky, how to get rid of all evidence left.  Good thing I already thought of that...  a quick trip through the house and all pilot lights would be blown out setting the natural gas free to fill the house.  A good six hours later and the place would be prime to blow, all it would need is a little starter.  The body was disposed of, rather neatly and one trip back under the cover of wolven concealment and the paper covered in hair gel and pool cleaner would be folded and shoved through the mail slot.  After a good 5 minute run unseen across brick and pavement I could hear and feel the explosion, Justice served with a bang.<BR>
