I have noticed lately that the Spirits have begun to speak to me more in my dreams.  Their disconnected whispers carry to me in veiled bits of knowledge and power.<BR>
<BR>
Blackness, that familiar warmth of dead sleep.   Nothing but the encroaching void of unconsciousness.  But as usual it did'nt last long.  Next thing I know I am standing in the middle of street in horus, my body is bathed in blood and the Guardians are ringed around me all of them fighting as I bark out commands and direct the battle while shredding anything about to harm one of my pups.  The acrid and metallic smell of blood permeated the area, and<BR>
the mangled bodies lying around were far too maimed to be identified, but the seemed,  pale and cold.  With a start he woke and set bolt uprght in bed.  Sweat dripped from his brow and he looked to ensure that Ceile was safe and she was there, sleeping sound as usual.<BR>
<BR>
He stood up and slid out of the bed noticing that it was terribly low to the floor.  With a sleep laden shake to his head he cleared it from mind and moved to the kitchen to get a drink. The tappety tap of nails on the floor resonated as he walked to the kitchen, he'd better not scratch the tile or Ceile would kill hi...  hi...  With a quick look down he sees the Blood slpattered white fur on his rather canine shaped legs, then up to his abdomen and<BR>
chest.  He gazed at his hands and saw the long black talons... with a quick scramble he made his way to the wall mirror and peered into it.  The reflection was astounding.  He was in Horus and not ticked off nor raging, he was normal.  The first time you se yourself like this is astounding, checking out all the differences in YOUR body.  He was filled with a childish joy, like he had just gotten new Unde - Roos for christmas and was wearing them for<BR>
the first time.  Then as the excitement washed away the residue of anger and worry, he slowly opened his eyes.  Ceile all snuggled up to him with her gorgeous red hair splayed about the place like it lived of it own accord.  This was life.<BR>
