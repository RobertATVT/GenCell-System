  Things were in order, papers signed and a location found.  The second part of my goals was now a reality.  Things have changed so much since I first showed up here.  In the one and a half years that I have lived here I have changed in so many diferent ways.  I just flipped back in my journals to look for myself.  Yes, there it is.<BR>

  Well Alexi and I are here, Voletta, some small island off the coast of Louisiana.  Only here because that is where my trusty lucky dart landed.  Yeah, so I leave the decisions of where I will move to a map and a dart.  That isn't so strange is it?  Okay, maybe it is, but it works for me.  That's how I met Alexi, in some piddly town named Kurov in Romania.  He was a good kid, always reading and staying to himself.  I think I got him his first beer, and I wouldn't swear to it...  but I think I was the first person he had talked to in years.  The regulars had thought he was a mute, so they didn't bother with him.  The  freakish birthmark on his neck didn't help, looked like a wolf howling at the moon it did.  <BR>
<BR>
  Time went on at the pubbish little drinking hole I was working at, and Alexi and I became friends.  Then in the middle of conversation he asked if he could follow me to America...  I couldn't say no, this kid had become the little brother I never had.  I told him that I would allow him to follow me wherever he went, and that if anyone messed with him... I would deal with it.  Now here we are, just got our papers and landed on the docks.  I wonder how long this place will keep my attention, for that matter I wonder if I will like this odd little place at all.  Who knows, maybe this will be my last stop?<BR>

</I>  That seems like a lifetime ago... and in some small ways, it was.  I'm not the scared man I once was, running from a ghost of a love lost.  Granted, I don't think I will ever have anyone in my life that will complete me like she did.  Don't get me wrong, I love Ceile with every breath I take, but there will always be a part of me missing.  Funny how I can take a bullet to the face and next morning, nothing...  but my heart will never fully heal.  I have become what ended my youthful happiness.  I understand now the rage that the creature must have felt as he stalked the manor.  The feeling as it ripped a family asunder.  I have felt it, I have become that rage.  I also have defeated it.  Now my time is spent trying to save others from suffering the same fate.  To prevent the loss of innocent lives.  Sounds like a dream doesn't it, an impossible achievement?<BR>

I saw Skye again today.  I can't get her out of my mind.  She is there when I sleep, when I eat, when I walk, always there.  It's like looking at what Suzette would have grown to be, if that madman hadn't killed her.  Butcher.  The gunshot wounds are still healing, I can't believe that son of a [] shot me.  I found out yesterday that I had been out cold for three weeks, even now I feel depleted.  I hope I never have to read this again, I can hardly hold the pen.  If only I wasn't so weak. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Ceile had come to me out of the breeze it seemed.  She had been dating James but they had ended it, they were friends now.  He brought her to a small get together I had planned, she wasn't invited and I was a little miffed by it all.  That lasted till she laughed the first time.  I still remember the perfume she was wearing as she helped me cook dinner for the assembled friends.  I was planning on cooking, it was after the car accident so I wasn't to fresh and was still a little burnt in spots.  I guess she noticed that there was something wrong and offered to help. She is asleep right now, and even now that smell is present.  Light, airy, beautiful.  We began seeing each other shortly after that, and it was like a breath of fresh air.  It was living poetry, the very essence of everything I had lost.<BR>

Please let this be the last entry, I can't take this anymore.  I had her, then I lost her.  The one thing in this world that I love as much as Suzette has slipped through my fingers.  The worst part is that I was to blame, I caused it.  The guilt I felt for what I had done to her was eating at me.  She was happy with Deimin, she was content with her life.  It didn't bother her that he didn't breath, he didn't eat, he was room temperature.  That filthy monster touching her made me ill.  So I went to Evan, he felt nearly the same as I did.  We made a plan involving another fanger, seems those freaks have a way of making one of their kind love another.  Not naturally of course, more like love chained to the boot of their master.  The idea repulsed me, much like the idea of their existance.  Lazarus would help us, then Deimin would be out of her life.  Sounded a lot easier then, now everytime I see the pain in her eyes...  There has to be a way I can die.  Surely burning to ash at the bottom of a cliff would do it.  That is what I am going to do now.  I can't stand not being a part of her life.  Well, hopefully this is goodbye.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>  That was an exercise in futility.  That "accident" was the stupidest thing I have ever done.  Well not the stupidest, I have done worse.  The videotape.  The three bullets in my own face by my own gun.  Soemtimes I wonder why she puts up with me.  Look at her, beautiful, caring, soft.  And here I am, rude, obnoxious, as much a killer as the butcher.  Even with all her goodness, there must be an attraction to things of a dark nature.  Mordithius, Rane, Malcom...  all fiends, all dark and disturbing.  I had discovered from Ali long ago that Ceile was in "love" with Mordithius, Rane and Mordi both fed from her.  She enjoyed it apparently, I sat in the Symposium once with her and caught her eyes drifting to Mordi, watching him.  Then the time I followed them, hidden with powers supernatural and undetectable.  She had told him that she was with me now, and that would never change.<BR>

<B><I>Death</B>.  That [] has to die.  Him and that slut Alicia.  To think that I trusted Alicia, hell I even slept with her, and she lured Ceile into Damians hands.  That lowlife piece of filth.  I think I will remove his hands first, maybe I will use an exacto  knife and slice them off centimeter by centimeter...  Next I will remove his tongue... yeah, I will cautorize it with an iron... no steam.  Hmmm.... what next?  Oh yeah, I will remove his genitals, put them through a meat grinder and serve them to him as a nice healthy GardenBurger. hahaha.  Then I will proceed to skin him... while he is alive...  Yes.  <B>Death</B>.  I like the sound of it.  I should throw Ceile out, but Ali and Damian are the ones that got her drunk.  They are the ones that did it...  Alicia starting it all, getting Ceile intoxicted and then, here comes Deputy D...  how conveeeeenient.  <B>HE WILL DIE!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>Well, almost mine forever.  Barring that small descrepency of course.  Now I have mostly forgiven Damian, and made peace with Alicia.  Ceile and I are married... sorta.  More of a two pistol wedding at the hands of one Roland Deschain, but it counts to us.  She is my mate, for life.  Nothing can or will change that, barring another instance like before, then all bets are off.  Sorry, I only forgive once.  But that hopefully will never happen.  Things are good, The Dojo is doing well and Eclipse is up and running.  Matter of Fact, had my first real hire today.  Some big guy that people call Bear.  He is immense, huge...   he is a walking spectacle to be sure.  I had met him once beofore with Roland...  on the Spliff.  Rolli kept calling him dad for some reason, but boy did we have a blast.<BR>

Oh my Lord... Roland and his friend Jerrod got an honest to God pirate ship.  They named it the Spliff.  I was lying here with Ceile tonight and I heard Roland shouting in my head...  "Victor, come to the docks...  I have a surprise for you"  Then I heard booms... not like someone knocking on the door, not the sound of a pistol being fired.  I mean BOOMS, full on manly kinda reverberating the whole island kinda booms.  Cannons I would later find out.  So there I went, to the docks... and what do I see?  The Spliff.  Roland sancing around in a pirate costume, Jerod dressed as a king, Otis the Pug...  this was the kicker... Napoleonic admiral duds...  nope, I was dead sober.  Well, that didn't last long after I joined them and was coerced into geting into a costume, of course I went with this Erol Flynn swashbuckler getup.  Oooohhh... was I snazzy.  So I partyed, played, had a blast... me and this Gigantic Neanderthal Linebacker from hell Paleolithic Mammoth of a human spectacle named Bear took turns diving with passengers from the mainmasts swingarm.  My lord it was insane.  Some little cutie named Chance decided to, ummm... ride me in the dive on more than one occasion...  all I could remember at the time is what I would do to her if I was single, and that she smelled like bottled sex.  No, not sexy, but like sex...  you know that hot musty smell...  oh well, I had fun.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>  The family is doing well, the kids are growing like sprouts, I have quite an extended family now.  Alexi is still here, he is kinda married to some freakish oriental chic.  We hardly talk, he went behind my back and got a job with that freak Malcom.  Right after I specifically told the family to not have anything to do with him.  Not one week after.  It kills me.  I have taken care of him, fed him, given him a place to live.  I have taught him everything I know, and he does something like that.  It breaks my heart, betrayal by the one person that you thought would never cause you harm.  I made him immortal, I gave him strength...  I avenged his family, and nearly paid with my own life.  I spent three weeks being tortured at the hands of his families killers, and this is what I get?  My hair is snow white from the incident, I still have scars over nearly every inch of my flesh.  <BR>

We are finally free.  Ann, Blake, Lexi, Jon, Wolf, Laura... we are all fine.  For the most part.  Three weeks they held us captive, three weeks I was beaten and tortured so that they could pry the name of our leader from us.  What would they have done to Ann and Blake if they found out I was the leader?  They would have killed them outright.  Instead they kept me bolted to a table, and every day they would cut some piece of me away and watch it regrow.  About every other day they would cut my chest open and spread my ribs,  keeping me on pain killers so I didn't enter shock.  After they had my ribs opened for Ann and Blake to see, they would do various things to kill me.  Right in front of their eyes.  Making them watch.  Making them hear me scream in agony.  Making them gaze on me as the last drops of blood flowed from my body.  Their methods were thorough, not lavish or well trained, but the stun gun to the heart was a nice touch.  Nothing like a never dying victim to be the object of an anatomy class.  I took great pleasure in pulling the face off of that doctor.  It was even more pleasure pulling it out of my pocket a few miles down the road as we made our escape. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Funny how things affect the human, or mostly human, mind.  I remember when I snapped that night.  I remember walking down the halls, guns blazing, never stopping more than it took to pick up another gun.  Not once did I stop laughing.  Not once was the smile off my face as I enjoyed killing each and every breathing thing in that 200+ man facility.  Blake had gone through his first change and was a mad beast let loose to kill indescrimanately.  Ann was nearly the machine I was, but she took far less pleasure in it than I did.  I killed, because I could not die.   I slaughtered for the multiple times I had died at their hands.  Now I take anger management classes.  What a perdicament.  Life is funny that way.  Now I watch cameras, and guard the lives and secrets of others.  I have made it my duty to be this islands Watcher, to do what I can to save the lives of those weaker.  Do I have a Robin Hood complex?  Who cares, I only do what I feel is right, and I will let nobody get in my way.<BR>

::With a drop of the pen and long sigh the journal is closed and bound by the silk ribbon extending from the spine.  A lethargic stand brings the large white haired man to a stand.  A slow stride brings him to the bed where she lies, so beautiful, so fiery, so untameable.  With a drop of the robe he curls up next to her, laying a powerful arm around her waist and once again taking in the scent of her.  Fresh, lovely... His wife.  The darkness surrounds them, the beauty and the beast.  Like fables and childrens tales, yet all to real. :: <BR>
