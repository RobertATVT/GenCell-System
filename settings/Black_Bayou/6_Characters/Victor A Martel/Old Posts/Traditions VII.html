	He looked up for the carnage that surrounded him, his trance broken by the voice and the sneering words.<BR>
<BR>
	"End this, or I will kill the mortal Martel" Antoni's voice rang through the den of battle cold and clear.  Victor stopped and dropped the dead bodies held in his iron grasp.  There he stood, tall and lithe, hair black as a moonless night.  One hand held a long gleaming dagger, the other held the bruised and beaten body of Jordan, his mortal half brother.  Victor lunged only to be stopped short by twon hands, his eyes clod and hateful as the dagger raised and pressed into Jordans soft throat.  Blood began to well at the surface of Jordans neck as Victor looked around to see Gunnar and Marie holding at his arms, their bloodsoaked bodies tired from battle.<BR>
<BR>
	"I warn you Victor Alexander Martel, you take one more step and I will leave your bastard brothers head here to be kicked around like a toy.  You filthy halfbreed" His voice spilled out full of hatred, and he spit into Jordans face and snarled in self appointed victory.  Marie and Gunnar let their grips loose on his arms as he stood there, his eyes watching still as more wolves gathered to each side of him, he came prepared... they were still outnumbered four to one.  After all the Hunted children that had been slain, the Conclave was still the smaller force.  His real pack stood there by his side, twelve total... all must have become rogues and broke their bonds to provide such numbers... Antoni was truly insane.<BR>
<BR>
	"You are a coward Antoni, hiding behind a mortal... no wonder you betrayed your own kind to hunters.  Did you promise your children that they would take the seats of the Conclave so that you could rule?  You are pathetic and weak, the reason you couldn't take the position on your own."  Marie stepped forward, her voice challenging the Hunted Alpha.  Victor watched as Antoni's grip began to slip and Jordans half conscious body slumped towards the ground.  Antoni stepped forward, his face a mask of bitter hatred in the dark gloom of the forest, his pack stretched out to each side of him ready to finish off the Conclave.<BR>
<BR>
	It was at the same time that Victor stepped forward, a snarl on his lips and his fur tinged red with the blood that nearly covered him.  He looked around him, Gunnar was on his last leg, Marcus had stopped breathing and was finished, even Marie was slumped and weary... There was no way that they could hold off the Hunted wolves, Three Alphas, six conclave members in varied forms...and Victor... an Outsider.  <BR>
<BR>
	"You want the Conclave?  You want to destroy the years of tradition and history that is held here?  You'll only do it through me you spineless cur.  Sending in children to do your dirty work... you are a tyrant and you certainly are no Wolf.  Come on coward." Victor's deep heavy voice rang out through the clearing, Antoni's face leering in glee at the prospect.<BR>
<BR>
	"Victor, no... you can't..." Marie's voice came silently to his ears, barely a whisper carried like a leaf on the wind.<BR>
<BR>
	"Marie, it's his choice... he's earned the right... we have no other choice, we are fiished if he fails."  Gunnars voice was the shocker, perhaps he actually had faith that Victor would succeed, or perhaps he would enjoy watching him fail... either way the lines of te challenge had been drawn... there was no way out.<BR>
<BR>
	"Are you challenging me you impudent boy?  Do you think that you can stand up against me?  I've watched you grow, I've watched you family... I cheered when the Wolf was stripped from your upstart line.  Crusaders and Heroes...  your family has always sickened me, and now you dare to bring your new blood to the table and throw the gauntlet at my feet?  How DARE you step to me as an equal?  How DARE you come up to me like you are part of this Conclave?  You don't belong here, go back to your little town and play the monster boy, that's all the fame you deserve... you and your family of mutts are nothing... the progeny of an outcast, sent from pack and family for treachery." Antoni howled into the night are, blazing with hatred his pack watched the exchange with curiosity.<BR>
<BR>
	"Does your pack know how you betrayed our kind?  Do they know that you gave two packs to hunters and would have given us all to them in the end?  Do they know how you promised up over half of them as well?  There's only room for six Alphas in a Conclave..." His eyes turn to them as he speaks... "You not only betrayed the Conclave, but you betrayed your own family... I do dare to challenge you, I do dare to step up and throw the gauntlet, and I challenge you as your superior.... you gave up all right to position with your treachery.  Now, do you accept or will you willingly subject yourself to your sentance so that your children can take their rightful place amongst the Conclave and spare themselves your fate?"<BR>
<BR>
	The answer was not a surprise, deep down Victor suspected how this part would turn out... surely he would fight.  The answer came in gleaming midnight black as Antoni shifted to his battle form and charged Victor.  Only a desperate spin on Victors part kept the majority of his side from being ripped away by Antoni's claws.  Out of the corner of his eyes, Victor saw the Hunted begin to step away, leaving their Alpha to his fate... a fate that would surely be more merciful than what they would deal him...  The battle wore on, Victor's already battered form taking more punishment than he has ever taken at the hands of one person, but he gave as ood as he got... he wouldn't let this new family down.<BR>
<BR>
	The battle went poorly, after a series of shots by Antoni, Victor was driven to the ground... body and spirit giving in, caving as Gunnar sent song's of war from his homelands to his mind, Marie's powers of calm kept his head clear and on the fight, s song of healing pouring from her to try and mend his wounds.... but Antoni had hundreds of years of experience by his side... countless battles and strategies, moves so radical that they stunned Victor over and over.  Finally he was on his back, Antoni leering hatefully above him, claws ready to finish off the Guardian Alpha.<BR>
<BR>
	"I had hoped that you would have proven a more formidable foe Victor... but no... you have fallen as easily as your poor sweet Suzette, and that bastard of a brother.  For shame... are you ready to die?  Alone?  Nobody here cares about you Victor, your newness has worn off, you are a burden now... a burden that.... " His tirade was cut short by Victors growl... his hand grabbed and his body slowly pressed away... he struggled to maintain control as Victor called upon some last reserve of strength... Revenge.  Victor had finally come across the man that had killed his first wife, the man that slaughtered his 16 year old bride so many years ago in Spain.  His body burned with hatred now, the song of peace that Marie had sung shattered and falling around him like glass... even Gunnar's song was abruptly halted as he fought back, pitting what strength he still had against that of Antoni... then there was a silence in the struggle, cut short by loud crash... a pistol perhaps... <BR>
<BR>
	Victor's eyes burned with hatred as Antoni's body jerked once and his strength slipped long enough for Victor to burst from the ground and throw the Hunted Alpha against a tree, his fist slamming into him over and over as he was pinned there... his hand began to glow with a silvery light... something unseen before, but Marie's voice was calm and clear in his mind... "Finish him".  One last blow left Victor's radiant fist to sink deeply into Antoni's chest, clutching his heart and freeing it as Antoni's last cry rang in the night air... his body slowly reverting to his human skin...  Victor slumped to the ground, tired, beaten, bloodied... on his hands and knees he sat there... breath heavy and coughing up blood.  He closed his eyes and felt the wamr heart beginning to cool in his hand, the sounds of the hunted dropping silently to their knees to one side as a set of footsteps approached from the other...  <BR>
<BR>
	His eyes slowly opened in time to catch the sight of a derringer hit the ground beside him, sinking into the blood soaked mud, followed by..... tennis shoes?  He looked up to see the beaten form of his brother standing over him, his hand outstretched in an attempt to offer aid, and a fear filled smile across his face...<BR>
<BR>
	"Thanks Vic...  thanks for not letting me die.....t....h.....i........s............" was all he heard as darkness took him.  His mind finally registering all the pain and shutting off in shock... and he fell... </I></FONT></HTML>
