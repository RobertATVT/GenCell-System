</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SCRIPT" FACE="Comic Sans MS" LANG="0">Well we all have to have a hobby huh?  Mine is my temple, my Dojo, my art.  I am Victor Martel owner and founder of the Shao Tei Tung Temple Dojo.  <BR>
<BR>
    The Temple is raised in short time, the pagoda style building taking it's place on Main Street in Voletta.  It's not a typical building for this region, but hey, Los Angelas has their Mans Chinese Theatre, so why not?  Besides it's not a full pagoda...  I cheated a bit.  It wa raised three stories with the sloped red tile roof and golden trim gleaming in the Sunlight.  The old style Dragon Gargoyles guarding the front entrance.  The inside is<BR>
like something straight from Big Trouble in Little China, lots of red walls and a golden ceiling.  The big fat statue of Budha in the front with the incense bowl in front of him.  It is all very quaint, quiet, and especially mine.  I spent three years in China, that's where I met my Teacher, guardian, mentor, and darn good friend Jean Paul.  Yu see, Jean Paul is some sort of religious icon in China, or at least the Temple of Light where he comes<BR>
from.  He is like the re-incarnation of a fallen Grandmaster or something.  I couldn't tell you the story, you would have to pry it out of him and he doesn't talk much, that's my job.  Well the temple is now open and we are teaching a variety of styles, so if you want to sign up...  walk through the doors...  If you want enlightenment, just talk to us.<BR>
