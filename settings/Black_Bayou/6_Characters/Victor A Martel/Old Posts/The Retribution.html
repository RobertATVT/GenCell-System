	The full lunar eclipse of 2000 will go down in history.  Most of us thought it would be like any other, another chance to go out and gaze at the wonders that existed in the world, nothing more special than that though.  We were wrong, this wasn't going to be just another chance to see a great orange moon hovering above us.  It was a sign.  It was the harbinger of mans darkest hour.  It was a sign of Retribution.<BR>

	Lot's of things happened that night, most went unnoticed until it was looked back on later.  Several things couldn't be overlooked however, like the moon.  The moon turned blood red, and never went back.  Never again would mankind gaze up at the beautiful silvery orn that he once did.  </HTML>
