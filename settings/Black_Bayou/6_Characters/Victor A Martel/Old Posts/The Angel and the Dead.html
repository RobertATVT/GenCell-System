<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12>	The lives around me move like so many bees gathering their honey.  Servicing their petty plots and schemes, their closet desires eating at them like a plague.  I walk through this world like the dead, even though inside me is a vitality that no mortal could fathom.  No, it is not my body that is dead.  It is not my pained mind that until recently seemed infected and diseased.  My Soul is shattered.  I never saw any future of repair, no hope of it even remaining constant.  My soul has been dying for over ten years now.  I never saw the light until she enveloped me and warmed my heart.<BR>
<BR>
	After the accident, with no memories, no hope, no heart, I returned to Spain.  Was there a more fitting place to rebuild who I am?  More fitting a place then where it all began?  I had to see the manor where she died, I had to return the locket I have carried like an anchor of guilt.  I visited her grave.  I went to place where she rests for the first time.  The tomb that was erected for her family was fitting, high elegance and absolutely a work of art.  The cold grey interior had beautifully carved busts of them all, I broke down like a young boy.  In ten years I have cried over her loss more times than I can count, but this was more than I could bear.  The sight of her there, carved in bitter stone, paralyzed me with grief and all I could do was sit there on my knees and weep.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	I don't know how long I was there, it seemed like days, and judging from the growth on my face it most likely was.  But I wasn't in my right mind the entire trip.  The entire time I was like a passenger in my own body, watching myself going through these motions thatI couldn't understand.  I was a clockwork menagerie, an automaton of grief and chaos.  The Manor had been unused the entire time, the family wouldn't allow anyone to live there and the place was more of a cemetary then I had been to before.  The place looked the same as when I left those long years ago.  The smells, the sights, the feelings where all there.  I walked to her room like a shadowed memory, a ghost myself in this Manor of terror and grief.  I slept there, curled up next to the bed, fleeting images fortifying in my dreams.<BR>
<BR>
	I said goodbye to her on that trip, I released her to roam the heavens where she belongs.  Once again she wears the locket that is hers.  The marble bust now carries the weight of my guilt.  I also gained my family back on this voyage.  My wonderful family that I have hurt more with my wanderings than if I took up a knife and flayed them.  It was a rebirth, like a pheonix rising from the flames, I had grabbed my once fleeting life by the hands and wrested it free from misery.  My inner demons driven from me and a new light filling me.  I now bear my grief on the outside, my tribal markings showing the pain like badge.  I survived a battle of the soul, one that I feared I would lose.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	I have returned to my new home.  I have come to make amends, and finish the things I have started.  With a new shield of courage and hope to guard me and a blade of love and understanding to stab at the wickedness that surrounds me.  I have come home.  The Isle of Veils has changed little in my absence, the machinations of the many unnatural minds are still at play.  Like so many mini Machiavelli's running around trying to be Princes.  Hundreds of Petty Tyrants, trying to gain postion and power over the weak.  And in all of this darkness, a light.<BR>
<BR>
	I went to The Symposium as usual, as everyone does, as is expected.  I ordered the same drink, sat in the same seat, and looked at the same faces.  However, in my absence something had changed.  The sound was like thousands of tiny stars falling like crystal chimes through my mind. Her voice was as if God himself had parted the heavens to allow me a private concert with the chorus of Angels that sooth even he.  I looked to the stage for the siren who could put out such a song, and Iwas struck dumb once again...  There she was, playing a piano and singing.  I had seen her brush by me outside as I smoked but was wrapped up in my own thoughts...  I think I even said hello to her.  But there she was, wrapped in a veil of light.  I had to be near her.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	We met again, this Angel and I the Dead.  We talked and laughed.  Our souls seemed to court each other, like two flames gathering together to consume each other in a dance of light and warmth.  The attraction was instant.  The meeting of Spirits was like unto a destiny.  She had appeared in town while I was being raised from the dead in a strange land.  The whole fo who we were filled the shallow reaches of each other, and we knew we were of one heart.  I showed her the Curse I bear, which she deems a gift.  I showed her the wolf within me.  I was afraid, I was once again the frightened boy running from the loss, but I stood with my new arms and armor.  I showed her who I was, what I have become.  And she never ran, never feared, and never judged.  I will give Kimberly this gift as she calls it.  For I have found a lifemate in her, I have found what completes me.  I have<BR>
found love.<BR>
<BR>
(The voyage continues...  The horizons becoming clear yet ever farther from me.  I take bolder steps now and I hold my head up high, for the world will never again place its weight on my shoulders.  From the depths of the dark sleep I have arisen, and from the wintery grip of death I fly like an Angel.  For now I am free, now I know Love.
