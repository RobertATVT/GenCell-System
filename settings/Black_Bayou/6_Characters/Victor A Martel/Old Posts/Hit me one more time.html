Victor went to class with the rest of the cadets... and boy how high school it felt.  Sitting there, the oldest, the biggest, the fastest, plain out misfit... the entire time he was in the class, while learning when to hit someone and when to just hold them... weeks worth of classes, he felt like he was back in Jr. High.   He even caught a few of the other recruits talking smack about him in one of the hallways while they were on a lunch break.   Next thing he knows their chest cavities were ripped open, entrails all over the place and blood sprayed across the walls behind them.  He took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a second, when he opened them... the guys were there kinda looking at him like deer caught in headlights, apparently they caught the glazed glare on Vic's face.<BR>
	"Good evening gents, having fun over there?"  He smiled and gave the guys a friendly nod and then went on about his lunch away from everyone else... and that damn drill instructor wannabe trainer monkey... drove him absolutely nuts he did.  But the classes came and went, he behaved and tried to cut out the episodes as best as he could, but everytime he would catch the other recruits pointing and laughing, or the instructor would smack him with the baton in a failed attempt to get submission... more blood, more death... but then the sight would pass and he would be sitting there... or standing with a baton in his hand after he ripped it out of the instructors hands (Which of course would lead to him getting smacked across the stomach or back a few more times for a good lack of respect... but hey... you get used to that with friends like mine.).   One more set of classes to go... everything would soon be over and Vic would be a Cadet... a cadet... ::Sneer:: a cop.....  pig.... oinker.... driving the bacon sled....  Oh how the mighty have fallen... </B></FONT></HTML>
