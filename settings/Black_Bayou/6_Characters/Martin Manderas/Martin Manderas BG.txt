	In what would become Sparta in a future millenium a child was born.  Proud parents would name him Menelaus.  Strong healthy and full of vigor this child would become a torment to civalizations to come.  His past would stretch thousands of years, filled with neverending games with great political figures and disasters.  Through all this time one focal point has remained in his life, his greatest competitor and historical chessmate.  Dione, known now as Tana Scarletti.  <BR>
<BR>
	The two of them met in ancient greece, his travels taking him to the island paradise, and technological wonder of that age, of Thera.  The island civalization that once was Atlantis.  Such mysteries still are not discovered to this day, locked inside the minds of the few survivors and politcal red tape that refuses to allow exploration.  The two where young, Menelaus a few years older than she was, but what drew them was their intuitive and superior minds.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>1473 BC<BR>
The Island of Thera</B><BR>
<BR>
	He made his way to the forum to listen to philosophy and rhetoric, it was a hobby when not pouring over scrolls filled with religion and history.  A fair day as always on this paradise, such wonders that could be found here.  Nothing like the primitive workings of his homeland.  The people of Thera, or Atlantis as it would be known, lived in times far beyond their reckoning.  Every home had running water, both hot and cold, and fineries unseen for thousands of years.  This is a place he could call home, though his father wouldn't allow it.  Oh well, if he couldn't have Thera, he would hire Theran engineers and thinkers to make his home like theirs.  <BR>
<BR>
	He sat there for a while, listening to the old men proclaim which God was better, which one had the best principle values.  This sort of nonsense lasted only so long before he would get tired and throw in something to stir them into a frenzy.  This time however, he didn't get that chance.  He hadn't noticed the girl for some reason, which was unusual in it's own right, btu she chimed up with something that would later cause him to have to rescue her from the anger of more than one zealot.<BR>
<BR>
	"Have you ever seen your God?" She asked, plainly and without care.  Apparently she enjoyed the same desire for upheaval that I did.  Of course the question was absurd, of course none of them had ever actually "seen" a God, but as usual they would fluster and begin describing great visions of men and women coming to them to direct them.  Each new story would get more and more outlandish by the telling.  She sat there watching them with a slight smirk on her face, she knew they were lying as much as they did, and I watched her.  She was slight, maybe two and a half cubits tall... maybe a hand more, her hair was the darkest black.  Her eyes were the greatest fascination, I had never in my life set eyes upon such brilliant green eyes before and to this day I still haven't.  She wasn't of much station, perhaps of mixed lineage judging by the slight ruddy hue to her skin, but she was an attractive child.  <BR>
<BR>
	The blustering old priests were almost shut out when she noticed my outright staring at her, and then she looked at me appraisingly.  Mind you, women of that day did not appraise men as they do now, the God's forbid a young girl do so.  However, here sat this young lady of no more than sixteen cycles, and then she gave a playful wink and turned her attention back to the men, her face dripped with mischief and I knew that today would be the beginning of something fun.<BR>
<BR>
	"Zeus came down to me and shared my bed, he said that I was far more beautiful than that crone wife of his." She said playfully, and seemed to be braced for the madness that would ensue.  Certainly she had known that what she claimed would spark a violent argument.  The old priest of Zeus turned red with shock from the girls blasphemous words, we all knew that Zeus kept many women, but the priesthood didn't like to harp on that issue.  The priest of Hera immediately began taunting the other priest of Zeus about his unfaithful God, and how could his God be faithful to his servants f he couldn't to his wife.  Before long fists where flying and a rather spry follower of Zeus decided it was the girls fault and she would be throttled for her error.  Of course, he wouldn't manage.<BR>
<BR>
	Why I helped that girl I still do not know.  Why on earth I drew my cudgel and shattered the forearm of that man as he grabbed her is still a mystery.  Since that day though, I not only have a friend that has been by my side for over 3000 years, but also the biggest pain in my butt.  Oh well, they say you can't choose your friends.  Back to the story though....<BR>
<BR>
	After I commited a grievous mistake by outright attacking and maiming a member of the priesthood, I grabbed the girl by the arm and fled with her.  Still not believing what I had done, and cursing myself and her for the stupidity.  That would certainly make my father proud, to get a message saying that his son and heir was killed in Thera for striking down a holy man.  She on the other hand thought it was the funnest thing she had seen yet, and was just overjoyed that a young, stupid, blustering noble from Sparta would come to her rescue.  Just like a woman.<BR>
<BR>
	Through the rest of the day we walked and talked together about things, she was fascinated by my sorcery and studies of lost arts.  She was by no means a devout follower of any of the Gods and had that same spark and thirst for knowledge that I held, onyl thing was that she wasn't a high born, and wasn't likely to marry one.  Your average man in those times would not suffer to be with a woman as fierce and independant as she was, and definately not one with such an unruly mouth.  She was fun though, I enjoyed her company and set her up with a decent place of her own, money was no object to be horded in my opinion.  I took care of her and had scrolls sent to my "Lady" at my Theran villa.  Of course I had to return to Sparta for periods of time but I would always return to Thera and Dione. <BR>
<BR>
	Oh yes, that was her name.  Funny thing about that though, if you read back through history, some years after that episode in the forum a new goddess would arise, one of Love and Beauty.  Aphrodite, apparently Zeus had gone and taken another mortal woman who had sired yet another God to the pantheon, the mothers name?  Dione.  How is that for a twist?  Well Dione and I became fastest friends and compatriates, spending long hours into the night debating religion and philosophy, tinkering with new creations and inventions.  She was happy that she didn't have to sommision herself out as a servant any longer, and I was happy to have someone who understoond my lust for knowledge.  It was worth every coin I spent to pay her way through life.  I still have some of those coins, perfect shape and cared for, most of my belongings I have let pass through the ages, but I have keepsakes worth a kings ransom.  That's the first thing you learn of the world, an economic obsession with things of the past.  Wonder how much Dione and I would fetch on the open market.<BR>
<BR>
	Now here it is thousands of years later... my body kept young because of treachery and evil.  Can't have everything can you?  During the three days that poor Dione began her passing into the night I was furious and tormented.  I refused to allow her to die.  I called forth all the power my mortal form would allow, only to fall to the darkest rituals and most deeply reviled summonings man could perform.  On the last night, as she died in my arms I unleashed every ounce of power my body held, clearing it for the vow I made at the same time.  Now there are two of me living here, an entity and myself totally enmeshed in the possession that has made me forever young.  What can I say though?  It's been a fun 3400 some odd years.</HTML>
