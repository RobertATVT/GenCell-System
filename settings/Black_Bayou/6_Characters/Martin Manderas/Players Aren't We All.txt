	Weeks have passed since I left her in the palazo in Thera, plenty of money for her needs and people to care for her while I was away in Sparta.  Not that I was truly in Sparta anyhow, but as far as she was concerned I was.  I had actually stayed in Thera to continue plans that I had put into motion, helping a friend of my family to gain a position on the Senate.  Long had I planned on how to remove Diomede from his position so that Arus could take his place.  A little seduction of Diomede's rather young wife, a bit of pregnancy, and lots of disgrace brought to the ears of our sovreign.<BR>

	Ahhh, but how things change.  Seems another player entered my little event and had come to put her part into it all.  Such a plotter she had become, learning rather well how to manipulate men to her own ends.  I watched her for hours on end, following in the one of the many shapes that my magic had let me bring onto myself, yet something else she did not know about me.  Would she have ever guessed that the Raven that followed her was actually me?  How about the black cat she brought home that she held long hours into the night crying for my return?  It's truly amazing the things that people will say in the presence of an animal, even more amazing what they will say directly to an animal.<BR>

	So little did the two of them notice the small animals that pranced around them, so little did they cover there plottings and schemings.  Discontent, I will show him discontent.  Does he think that he plays with someone so easily outmaneuvered?  If he were to have his wife removed after such an ordeal with that petty Soothsayer of mine, it would lead into a veritable storm against him.  Poseidon himself would lash against him for blaspheming his name.  It was all I could take to keep from slaying him on the spot with that proposal to my Dione.  Once again this uncouth rabble has encroached upon territories that are not his own.  What a pathetic man he is, certainly his Houses wealth bought his seat on the Senate.<BR>

	Calm come to me, by the right hand of Zeus I will not lose control of myself while watching this wretched display of betrayal.  None the less, I watch and listen to each detail of his plans.  I listen to Dione bending this poor fool to her will, just to spite me no doubt.  She will lose as well, such games are not in her favor... though she is learning quickly.  Sickening sweetnes pours from her lips, telling the malleable fool what he wishes to hear, I sadden to carry his gender.  What a mockery he makes of the true born blood that flows in his veins.  Fare thee well Diomede, perhaps in hades you will find the strength you so need, for in hades you shall soon find yourself.  </I></HTML>
