Holy Grounds -- Coffe and Occult Shop. The very name conjurs forth images of <BR>
dimly lit stacks, wandering asiles, and soft leather sofas which invitingly draw down the very fiber of the readers soul. Within it's ivy and moss covered walls are hidden many secrets. Some say it's dark master holds even more. Several places within the old mansion are crafted to hide secret volumes. <BR>
<BR>
Inside one such lost vault,  kept sealed away from the hapless customers sight, is one such area, filled with various ancient, faded tomes. A tattered and well worn book -- marked carefully with a dry, dirty brown leather strap -- reclines on a velvet pillow of simmering red. Torn pages litter the book,  obviously ripped from the bindings that once held them tight to other books.  Dusty scrolls -- at least half a dozen -- lay scattered along the inside of the chamber.  The light of day does not reach the precious papayrus leafs, sealed tightly away  in the hidden wall safe. <BR>

Upon inspection of the top page, apparently the newest in a long line of pages, one notes it's almost modern looking -- with it's shiny paper and thin style print. Delicatly is has been ripped out, and reads as follows :<BR>

"Thousands of years after it supposedly sank into the cold and gloomy depths of the Atlantic Ocean, the island continent of Atlantis lives on as one of history's most tantalizing puzzles. Atlantis was a civilization unequaled before or since.  Yet its chroniclers say that it vanished in little more than a single day, leaving not a trace behind." <BR>
<BR>
The oldest and fullest surviving account of the great island's rise and fall was provided by the Greek philosopher Plato in the fourth century BC.  According to Plato's description, "Atlantis was a land where skilled agriculturists created sweet scented orchards and where animals flourished.  Within its chief city were innumerable mansions outdone in grandeur only by the royal palace and by the nearby temple raised to honor Poseidon. But neither gold nor glory could save the Atlantans from themselves.  Their growing materialism mightily offended the gods", wrote Plato, and the whole civilization was condemned to a swift and spectacular end. <BR>
<BR>
"Atlantis has often been linked with other places of mystery, among them the pyramids of Egypt and the stone slabs of Stonehenge. Unlike those brooding monuments, however, the land that Plato portrayed is no more tangible than memory or dreams.*"<BR>
<BR>
Plato's account of Atlantis is sketchy at best.  There has been no written record of what truly happened on the infamous isle, only vague discriptions of what 'might' have or 'could' have happened.  <BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The ancient book had been passed from hand to hand and proclaimed an air of mystery.  Each owner thinking to unlock part of a puzzle that has riddled the minds of mankind for ages, and each tome of its kind proclaimed the same.  That none would solve the location and mysteries of fair Atlantis.  If this was indeed one of those tomes and you were the reader, an unlikely chance at best, you would see that notes have been scrawled into the margins in an old Scottsmans style.  That style would be of Malcom, and referred to the proclamation that the mysteries shall never be solved:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
