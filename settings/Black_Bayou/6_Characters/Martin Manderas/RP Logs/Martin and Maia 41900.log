Martin Manderas: 	::His eyes wander across the seemingly ancient city that sprawls around him, this spot on ~
Martin Manderas: 	the balcony had always been his favorite, adoring high places it took his mind back to the ~
Martin Manderas: 	grand homes he has owned through time.  Each one fitted with some high perch where he could~
Martin Manderas: 	dwell to look down on those below him, like the royalty that he had been through most of ~
Martin Manderas: 	his existance.  People were a study of his, and how they worked a science into itself.  ~
Martin Manderas: 	Long years passes since he had actually found a person of interest::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Having spent the early most hours of the evening at the center, she left the children with
Maia Lndmt: 	a smile in her eyes.  They so sweetly clustered, PJ's and bare feet.  She was so enchanted 
Maia Lndmt: 	by the lingering spirits within these city walls, it was as if she were not alone.. even if 
Maia Lndmt: 	the streets had been completely empty; which they never were. Wandering, but with purpose 
Maia Lndmt: 	she found herself a casual passerby, enveloped within the garden district so animate with 
Maia Lndmt: 	the blooms of the season.  Touching her fingertips to an wrought iron fence, she bowed her 
Maia Lndmt: 	head to inhale the dainty scent of a creeping cluster of white; sweeping back the inevitable
Maia Lndmt: 	strands of sunfire that trickled across her cheek and clung to the natural moisture of her 
Maia Lndmt: 	blushing lips::
Martin Manderas: 	::He watched everyone pass by, most were rather uncouth and stained in his eyes, the sins ~
Martin Manderas: 	that followed them could nearly be seen as they passed. None of them catching his interest~
Martin Manderas: 	until his eyes caught the pale beauty that trailed her fingers across the gate of his home,~
Martin Manderas: 	apparently she had a taste for finery and her hair was most beholden to him.  That coloring~
Martin Manderas: 	always seemed rare and exotic to one who spent most of his living days inthe presence of ~
Martin Manderas: 	the dark haired mediteranean peoples.  He leaned on his elbows and watched her, the grace ~
Martin Manderas: 	of each movement showed a hint of proper lineage or at least schooling, everything about ~
Martin Manderas: 	her screamed proper, and lovely.  Everything about her seemed... good::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Gazing into the intoxicating gathering of angel sweet bloom, she pondered the species of 
Maia Lndmt: 	floral.. one she did not know.  Unaware of being watched, she eased closer to the would be 
Maia Lndmt: 	barrier of the gate, driven to snare a single treasure from the vine.  Tilting her head 
Maia Lndmt: 	further, the bone structure in her delicate rolling shoulders enhanced slightly as she 
Maia Lndmt: 	pushed her features into the ginger mass.  Her eyes closing as the scent enticed her deeply,
Maia Lndmt: 	lashes catching on velveteen petals as she blinked.  Finally filled by its scent, she eased 
Maia Lndmt: 	her hand to her desire and tore, with the care of a gardener, a collection into her 
Maia Lndmt: 	lily fingertips.  Sweetly comforting them as she drew them to her bosom:: So lovely, shall 
Maia Lndmt: 	you accompany me this evening...
Martin Manderas: 	::Looking down on her he smiles and lets out a small chuckle that ripples through the ~
Martin Manderas: 	deep silent night air.  His chin resting in his hand as he sits there watching her pluck ~
Martin Manderas: 	the flowers that are rather a pride to him.  A free hand snakes without a glance to a stack~
Martin Manderas: 	of white roses to his left and they are taken up and one by one dropped from the balcony to~
Martin Manderas: 	her feet::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Her shoulder lifted some as the shower of roses, drew her cautionary response.  A sparing 
Maia Lndmt: 	breath inhaled through the oval of her lips, as she touched them and withdrew her stance by 
Maia Lndmt: 	two paces.  Casting her eyes heavenward, now able to see more clearly where the roses
Maia Lndmt: 	escaped from.  A flush of undeniably hue, stained her cheeks in the instance 
Maia Lndmt: 	she saw the man overhead.  Her hand retaining the flowers,sliding casually across her thigh
Maia Lndmt: 	and around to her back::
Martin Manderas: 	I thought that since you were collecting things of beauty to accompany one so heavenly, I ~
Martin Manderas: 	would do the most honorable thing and make my contribution to the cause, although my poor ~
Martin Manderas: 	flowers wilt in contrast to your most resplendant appearance.  ::With that he smiles, ~
Martin Manderas: 	perfect teeth trace a look of purity and sincerity across his stoic face as he bows from ~
Martin Manderas: 	his place on the balcony::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Already called out, she let her hand fall naturally to her side, flowers still clasp.  His
Maia Lndmt: 	words absorbed, and knowingly so as the crimson along her cheek bones deepens.  Watching him
Maia Lndmt: 	a moment, and feeling no danger in his presence, she stoops to the earth and takes up the 
Maia Lndmt: 	roses he cast.  Rising again agily, to smile upon him, chin lifted to watch him from above::
Maia Lndmt: 	I do prefer a wild bloom sire... though you roses speak of innocence,  which surely
Maia Lndmt: 	I am not; but a thief it appears... ::He tones are quiet, almost sing-song and slightly 
Maia Lndmt: 	traced with jest::
Martin Manderas: 	Ah... yes, a thief perhaps, but I would declare a thief of hearts m'lady.  One as beautiful~
Martin Manderas: 	as yourself surely has quite a following of suitors to press you into the gentle escape of ~
Martin Manderas: 	nightly seclusion.  If my dearest flowers shall give you a moments happiness than they have~
Martin Manderas: 	served me better than I had ever hoped.  The name is Mena...  ::takes a deep breath:: Martin
Martin Manderas: 	and you are?
Maia Lndmt: 	Where I hale, Martin.. it is said that a man with such an inviting tongue, is a man to be 
Maia Lndmt: 	avoided.. lest he draw us into his wiles and charm. ::She chortles soflty, clustering all of
Maia Lndmt: 	the like colored flowers, save one into her left hand.  Lifting the reserved one, she 
Maia Lndmt: 	met his downcast gaze, before brushing its petals across her lips and drawing her hand away,
Maia Lndmt: 	with enough leverage to toss the rose back into his keep. Turning as if that would
Maia Lndmt: 	crest her departure.. and hesitating in thought, she turned back.  Her lips turning a smile,
Maia Lndmt: 	as the color of her amusement light her eyes:: Shall I have your forgiviness then, or your 
Maia Lndmt: 	allowance to pay for that which I have taken.. for surely you love this garden, as I love my
Maia Lndmt: 	own.
Martin Manderas: 	I think a tad bit of restitution is exceptable..  and one cannot fault a man for speaking ~
Martin Manderas: 	the truth can we?  I would rather not lie in the presence of someone so fair and ladylike, ~
Martin Manderas: 	would be crude indeed.  As to the payment, your name will suffice.  I must know the name of~
Martin Manderas: 	the lady that seems to adore my garden as much as I. 
Maia Lndmt: 	::She sighs gently to his request, somewhat intrigued by the gentleman overhead:: Lady Maia 
Maia Lndmt: 	of Perthsire, if formality is your suit... though, I think once I have stolen something from
Maia Lndmt: 	you, all titles can be reduced to a simple first name.  ::She steps closer, this being the 
Maia Lndmt: 	usual time to offer a hand, she will simply curl it over the top of the same gate that drew 
Maia Lndmt: 	her eye originally::
Martin Manderas: 	Lady Maia, it is... to go into my own titles would not only be tedious but would cause for ~
Martin Manderas: 	me to seem fraudulant.  I however did notice the royal caste about your grace. ::With that ~
Martin Manderas: 	he places a firm hand on the balcony rail and hops over it landing about three feet from ~
Martin Manderas: 	her and dropping to one knee:: The pleasure is mine Lady Maia of Perthshire, my Garden and ~
Martin Manderas: 	my attentions are at your beck and call.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Despite the nature of show in his descention, she finds a gasp of breath in her mouth.. as
Maia Lndmt: 	he does it graciously,and comes out unscathed.  She nips her bottom lip, as her eyes light 
Maia Lndmt: 	over his now more detailed features.:: Aye, but please call me Maia alone.. and I would warn
Maia Lndmt: 	of such a generous invitation, or you shall find that I return. ::Shifting herself before 
Maia Lndmt: 	him, she lowers as well, but into a feminine crouch.  Making even the level of their eyes, 
Maia Lndmt: 	her eyes a live with a sparkle of laughter:: Shall we both stand erect then?
Martin Manderas: 	::Taking her hand softly and bringing it to his lips ever so properly he stands with her ~
Martin Manderas: 	his own stance a bow before her still for a few moments before standing, his height about a~
Martin Manderas: 	hand over six foot, his build classic and stoic, varied extremely from the musculature and ~
Martin Manderas: 	qualities of modern men.  Amber eyes meet hers and seem to glisten with an inner strength ~
Martin Manderas: 	as his lips part into a smile, his Spartan features light up gently:: And your return would~
Martin Manderas: 	be considered a bad thing?  I have more flowers than one man can enjoy, and the pleasure of~
Martin Manderas: 	someone else sharing them with me would be tremendous.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Her own dress, a simple, strap cut ankle gown.. sheer over white silk.  Nothing 
Maia Lndmt: 	distracting from her unkempt tresses, in the way of jewelry or makeup.  She smiles 
Maia Lndmt: 	thoughtfully at every display of his gentlemans nature.:: (s) Though I wager, a man of your 
Maia Lndmt: 	grace.. has an enamoured collection, to share the wonders of his gardens and home. ::That 
Maia Lndmt: 	said as her gaze shifts past him, toward the anterior of his glorious dwelling:: It is 
Maia Lndmt: 	lovely...
Martin Manderas: 	Le puits est retourné ma dame.  Thank you, I have spent decades gathering things to make ~
Martin Manderas: 	myself a perfect home.  Would you care to see it a bit closer?  I assure you that I am most~
Martin Manderas: 	harmless.  It is rare that I find such noble and gentle company.
Maia Lndmt: 	Decades... ::Repeated but not questioningly, as she takes the moments to peruse his home 
Maia Lndmt: 	before turning her focus back to his face::  Non of us are truly harmless, Martin.. ::Her 
Maia Lndmt: 	lashes touching down to her apples, before lifting to his full height:: though I do adore a 
Maia Lndmt: 	tour, and would be ungracious to decline your invitation.. perhaps we could find some water,
Maia Lndmt: 	for my flowers.. ::That added, gently and most assuredly playfully::
Martin Manderas: 	By all means, I think I have the perfect vase for them as well, shall we be away fair Maia?~
Martin Manderas: 	::His arm crooks at the elbow allowing a place for her arm to brace, old fashioned to the ~
Martin Manderas: 	t's as he awaits her, the smile on his face and his style of loose clothing make him appear~
Martin Manderas: 	most cavalierish in nature, but gentle and respectful like someone of noble lineage::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Moving a strand of fire across her forehead, she casts her eyes to his arm, a 
Maia Lndmt: 	consideration to decline, as chivalry is not often seen, and is rather intimate.  Yet, she 
Maia Lndmt: 	is easily drawn into such genteel things, so she does in time slide her fingertips under
Maia Lndmt: 	the flesh of his arm, curling it so and touching her other; blooms and all over the top.:: 
Maia Lndmt: 	Aye.. I am enticed, lead on... 
Martin Manderas: 	S' il y a une chose que je dois dire dans sérieux, c'estd'avoir jamais peur de moi. ~
Martin Manderas: 	::His steps lead them into the large foyer and he gestures to the french palisade styling ~
Martin Manderas: 	and the seating for visitors to await admittance, suits of Armor line the walls all of the ~
Martin Manderas: 	maximillian gothic styling, and all sized the same, one or two having marks cut into them ~
Martin Manderas: 	in various lethal areas:: This is the foyer of course, which I styled in a very post ~
Martin Manderas: 	renaissance styling.  The Armor is authentic as are the seats, the paintings, and the end ~
Martin Manderas: 	tables.  The wallpaper I had specially made from patterns I saw in a painting of the era.
Maia Lndmt: 	You must translate, or how else will I know if a spell is being cast.. ::Spoken as she draws
Maia Lndmt: 	her focus away from him, noting every detail he considers and more.  Familiar with the pride
Maia Lndmt: 	felt in such display, she is aroused.  Gently withdrawing her touch, and laying the flowers 
Maia Lndmt: 	near upon the floor, to the side as she steps closer and study's the armor more closely::
Martin Manderas: 	I am sorry, I was saying that if I will stress anything over and above, it is that you ~
Martin Manderas: 	should never feel fear in my presence.  I have never and will never hurt one of the fairer ~
Martin Manderas: 	gender.  You like that?  ::makes a motion to a manservant and looks at him for a moment and~
Martin Manderas: 	a very old Celtic clay pot is brought, the etchings on the side in the gaelic tongue and ~
Martin Manderas: 	the knotwork exquisite, the water inside sloshing a bit as it is set down beside her ~
Martin Manderas: 	flowers:: Will this Vase suffice for you M'Lady?
Maia Lndmt: 	::Touched but unadmittedly by his reasurrances, she quietly nods.:: I like anything derived 
Maia Lndmt: 	of passion, sire.. and war, though tragic is passion extreme. ::Studying it a moment longer
Maia Lndmt: 	she then tips her chin and looks to the pottery:: It's exquisite.. ::Reaching past him, she 
Maia Lndmt: 	reclaims the florals, and inserts them stem by stem into the life giving water::
Martin Manderas: 	The armor was worn by a Lord Maxwell of Marseir he proved to be a rather powerful foe in ~
Martin Manderas: 	combat and lived through several blows that are rumored to kill another man.  ~
Martin Manderas: 	He was little known in history, apparently he was a private man and put to death any who ~
Martin Manderas: 	told of his deeds.  ::Holding out his arm again for her he smiles:: Past these doors is my ~
Martin Manderas: 	main chamber, where I see to company before dinner and for light conversation.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Finishing her task, she spins toward him.. her eyes gravitating to him, and fixing there 
Maia Lndmt: 	as he unravels his tale.  One who finds a never ending lust for story telling, considering 
Maia Lndmt: 	his tale with a gentle bob of her head, she looks back to the suit.. wondering now if his 
Maia Lndmt: 	nature is immortal.  Smiling at the mystery, she steps over to take his arm once more::  
Maia Lndmt: 	My breath is baited, Mlord.. lead on..
Martin Manderas: 	::With a slight nod he leads her into the main chamber, the styling of this room is in ~
Martin Manderas: 	great contrast to the plush decadent stylings of the french era, mostly roman, with the ~
Martin Manderas: 	short couches meant for lounging and all covered in sheets of the most supple velvets.  ~
Martin Manderas: 	Across the walls are various period paintings, etchings and tapestries depicting everything~
Martin Manderas: 	from common life to the Gods.:: This I styled after one of my favorite Eras, that of the ~
Martin Manderas: 	roman empire, most of these furnishings are peiced together from various homes and families.
Martin Manderas: 	furnishings are pieced together from various homes and families, though the abundance of it ~
Martin Manderas: 	comes from a man know as Marcus Braxis, a rather well known
centurian.
Maia Lndmt: 	::She moves along side him, in soft though matched pace.. gazing
in an upward arch over the 
Maia Lndmt: 	details as he describes them.  Nodding in appreciation for both
the collection, as well of 
Maia Lndmt: 	his knowledge of such.:: I have not seen anything like it
before, its incrediable..
Martin Manderas: 	This is my other passion, woudl you care for a sip to drink
before we continue? 
Maia Lndmt: 	::Gazing at the drapping material with a fascination, she
responds somewhat late to
Maia Lndmt: 	his offer:: Only if you wish to indulge, otherwise.. I am well
enough..
Maia Lndmt: 	thank you.
Martin Manderas: 	Yes, I could do with a bit of tea or something, what is
your preference in tea's m'lady?  I~
Martin Manderas: 	that my meager stables hold the variety you prefer.  Please
have a seat. ::His steps lead ~
Martin Manderas: 	her to one of the backless couches of roman eloquence and
he motions for her to take~
Martin Manderas: 	whichever she wants to perch upon::
Maia Lndmt: 	::A tea drinker, how perfectly flattering. Crossing the floor
behind him, she selects the 
Maia Lndmt: 	one located nearest the tapestry, settling without fuss:: I do
approve of your tastes M'lord
Maia Lndmt: 	I have imported some beautiful, European 'fainting' couches much
in this style.. ::Her wrist
Maia Lndmt: 	rotating elegantly, as she traces the backs of her fingertips
across the material on which 
Maia Lndmt: 	she is seated::
Martin Manderas: 	::The soft scarlet velvet whispers as her fingers trace
across it's surface:: Thank you, ~
Martin Manderas: 	how many people do you know can say that they have lounged
in the same couch that a Roman ~
Martin Manderas: 	centurian also lounged on after so many battles?  Not many,
all of these are worth ~
Martin Manderas: 	countless vaults of money.  So, chamomile, Earl Grey, or a
rose blend?
Maia Lndmt: 	Cinnamon is my absolute.. though I also fancy chamomile..
::feeling the finery of the 
Maia Lndmt: 	material to her fill, she then places her hands within the folds
of her lap.. watching him a
Maia Lndmt: 	moment in thought:: Aye, 'tis enchanting a thought.. but I find,
also that sitting on the 
Maia Lndmt: 	pavement beneath the statue of liberty, in New York a
priveledge.  Think of all of the feet 
Maia Lndmt: 	that have crossed that path, lifting their eyes to a symbol of
freedom.  ::Her gaze does not
Maia Lndmt: 	avert, altogether curious as to how he will respond to the
comparison::
Martin Manderas: 	Cinnamon, I should have guessed.  I must be slipping in my
age.  Xavier would you please ~
Martin Manderas: 	prepare the lady some tea, be sure to garnish it properly.
::his attention turns back to ~
Martin Manderas: 	her:: True, my ancestors passed that route long ago...
there is something to be said for ~
Martin Manderas: 	that innocent glimmer in the eyes of the newly freed.  It's
almost comparable to...  love.
Maia Lndmt: 	::She considers his own comparison, with a thoughtful vibration
within the confines of her 
Maia Lndmt: 	throat::  Aye.. love is said to give you wings, and freedom does
the same; though I would 
Maia Lndmt: 	place my trust in freedom.. it is always worth fighting for, and
causes more passion than 
Maia Lndmt: 	even love.  Freedom is rarely fickle, though it can be taken for
granted. ::Her gaze lowers,
Maia Lndmt: 	she knows love can be as well.. though she quiets, the subject
not her most favored one at 
Maia Lndmt: 	the moment as she twines her naked fingers within each other;
the soft indent on her ring 
Maia Lndmt: 	finger giving away information that her lips have not::
Martin Manderas: 	I see that there is a point we disagree on m'lady...
freedom is fine and all but no man ~
Martin Manderas: 	has fought as fevered for freedom as they have for the love
and eye of a woman.  More ~
Martin Manderas: 	nations have fallen for the love of a woman than for the
rise of freedom.  Some of the ~
Martin Manderas: 	greatest men in human history fell for the love of a woman.
Never underestimate love, it ~
Martin Manderas: 	is one of the most powerful forces on this earth.  Not one
that I know from my own ~
Martin Manderas: 	experience, but on a scholarly level mind you.
Maia Lndmt: 	Oh, I shall never underestimate loves power... not I, blood has
been shed, and is yet 
Maia Lndmt: 	for her sake.  There is no other emotion in humanity, with more
force than love.. save 
Maia Lndmt: 	hatred.  ::Her jaw tenses only slightly, perhaps not noted as
she will not allow the 
Maia Lndmt: 	meloncholy of her heart to surface before this man, not one
ounce:: Though I have not
Maia Lndmt: 	hated in such a manner.... I have loved...
Martin Manderas: 	See we have a bit of a difference there as well...::before
he an finish a young man brings ~
Martin Manderas: 	them both tea on a platter, the cups are a very old china
as is the teapot.  Each glass ~
Martin Manderas: 	contains a small wedge of apple erched on the rim and a
cinnamon stick plunged through it ~
Martin Manderas: 	to stand there on the edge.  Moments later the tea is
poured and Xavier leaves them be:: ~
Martin Manderas: 	Thank you Xavier..  where was I?  Oh yes, I haven't been in
love to my knowledge, but ~
Martin Manderas: 	I have felt hatred on occasion.  nothing that I desire mind
you, it's a family trait.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Drawing the tea closer toward, her she inhales of the heady
combination of cinnamon and 
Maia Lndmt: 	apple; wanting to feel it coursing through her.  Letting it
cool, for the sake of propriety 
Maia Lndmt: 	she watches the servent take his leave, before refocusing on her
host:: I find it very 
Maia Lndmt: 	difficult to hate.. even those, that perhaps I should.  ::She
smiles quietly, and her words 
Maia Lndmt: 	are a sincere confesssion::
Martin Manderas: 	In my opinion, hate is the easy route, it takes very little
effort for such an emotion, but~
Martin Manderas: 	it is a downward spiral, the mroe you do it the easier it
becomes to do so again.  Love on ~
Martin Manderas: 	the other hand, takes work and dedication.. the more that
you love, the harder it is to ~
Martin Manderas: 	maintain.  I don't prefer to hate mind you.. it's simply
something natural that has been ~
Martin Manderas: 	passed from father to son for countless generations.  I try
to avoid those situations so ~
Martin Manderas: 	that someday perhaps my own children will not succumb to
the curse. ::he smiles and takes a~
Martin Manderas: 	drink of the scalding hot tea naturally and without
discomfort or pause::
Maia Lndmt: 	The curse..? ::Watching him, and very evident that he did not
wait until it had cooled she 
Maia Lndmt: 	wil simply make a mental notation, and do as he has; wanting
very much to feel the lent 
Maia Lndmt: 	warmth upon her skin.  She drinks, first a ginger sample.. to
savor the taste, and then 
Maia Lndmt: 	another swallow; her eyes closing as it makes a path through her
body and she shivers::
Martin Manderas: 	That's what my family calls our disposition, seems that
each of us has a rival that does ~
Martin Manderas: 	everything they can to put us under, ruin us in name and
station, but each one of us have ~
Martin Manderas: 	always outsmarted them, one of these days perhaps we won't
and we will lose everything.  ~
Martin Manderas: 	Mine is a rather crude businessman that had the gall to
steal the woman that I was with and~
Martin Manderas: 	corrupt her from what we had and the purity of who she was.
That infuriated me, I liked ~
Martin Manderas: 	her how she was.. then he came along.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Reading him quietly as he speaks, she sips again and sets the
mug back upon the tray:: It
Maia Lndmt: 	does sound like a no win scenerio.. I think it a noble idea to
spare your children from
Maia Lndmt: 	such fueding if you can.  Is it for this reason that you have
come to the States?
Martin Manderas: 	In a fashion yes... ::he moves slowly to a couch next to
hers and sits down lounging like ~
Martin Manderas: 	paintings of the old romans, the tea held carefully::  I am
searching for peace, and good ~
Martin Manderas: 	company... I have found one tonight, so for that I owe ou
until my last breath.
Maia Lndmt: 	Ah, but comfort found in company is often shared, is in our
case.  I wish you well in your
Maia Lndmt: 	search for peace, Martin.  I wish us all success in that
manner.. ::She smiles, shifting her
Maia Lndmt: 	alaignment, and reaching for the wedge of apple.  Removing the
spiced stick, and setting it 
Maia Lndmt: 	aside before lifting the still freshly sliced apple to her lips.
Savoring the juice as she 
Maia Lndmt: 	draws it slowly from the white flesh of the fruit; eyes flitting
toward him:: 
Martin Manderas: 	I have never before seen someone so thoroughly enjoy
somthing as common as an apple and tea~
Martin Manderas: 	you are truly a wonderful surprise m'lady.  What I woudl
have missed if I had not been on ~
Martin Manderas: 	that balcony to catch you stealing my flowers.  You say you
like war, do you like weapons?
Maia Lndmt: 	::Her cheeks fever again to his words, as she then returns the
slice to its origin.  
Maia Lndmt: 	Settling back, to watch the movement of his lips as she speaks..
and then his eyes:: Our 
Maia Lndmt: 	existence is a long span of time, what a shame.. and what mysery
we would experience, if we 
Maia Lndmt: 	could not derive bliss from the simple things... ::Removing any
traces of natures sugar from
Maia Lndmt: 	the bottom swell of her lip with the tip of her tongue, she
considers his query:: I would be
Maia Lndmt: 	a horrible person, if I liked war.... to clarify my fascination,
I am drawn by the passions 
Maia Lndmt: 	of war.  The story behind the battle, the drive behind the war
cry.  Weapons are beautiful, 
Maia Lndmt: 	especially those from our past.. though I cannot condone
violence, or the use of reckless 
Maia Lndmt: 	abadon when it comes to weapentry.  How about you?
Martin Manderas: 	::With a nod he stands, and holds out his hand for hers::
I'm going to take you to a rarely~
Martin Manderas: 	visited wing of my home, this one has no single story to
it, but numerous.
Maia Lndmt: 	Indeed.. ::Drawing her feet together, she slips her slender hand
into his grasp and rises 
Maia Lndmt: 	from the elegant support:: I hope it is linked to your history
specifically, that no doubt 
Maia Lndmt: 	would increase its draw.. 
Martin Manderas: 	::Takes notice of the temperature of her skin, being rather
cool the the hot skin of his ~
Martin Manderas: 	own, he looks at her with a touch of curiosity:: How do you
mean my own history?  I am but ~
Martin Manderas: 	a scarce few decades in age m'lady, I have no great
personal history.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Allowing her fingertips to twine in his, the accompanyment
slightly more casual in this 
Maia Lndmt: 	regard as they make their way.  She smiles:: You may only be
young, but your history.. it 
Maia Lndmt: 	goes far beyond your own mortal years.  Your history is a
literal stream of other people, 
Maia Lndmt: 	your ancestors..
Martin Manderas: 	Very true indeed, I will attempt to induldge you as best I
can. ::Smiling he walks her to a~
Martin Manderas: 	bookshelf and pulls it forward, the wall behind it open to
a passway.  He looks down at her~
Martin Manderas: 	fingers entwined with his and gives them a gentle squeeze.
A few steps inside and the ~
Martin Manderas: 	flick of a switch later she is staring at a museum of
armored and armed men in glass cases~
Martin Manderas: 	each one dating from the late 1400's AD to the times before
Rome was an Empire:: this is my~
Martin Manderas: 	gallery, along each wall is a weapon from each major era
that man has made it through. ~
Martin Manderas: 	each case contains authentic arms and armor from each, from
brass armor to full plate.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Very much impressed by his trust in her, she follows quietly.
Led by his hand, and 
Maia Lndmt: 	feeling nothing of anxiety to these more private confines, she
looks on.  Her eyes 
OnlineHost: 	Maia Lndmt has left the room.
OnlineHost: 	Maia Lndmt has entered the room.
Maia Lndmt: 	(please show me the last line you saw?)
Martin Manderas: 	feeling nothing of anxiety to these more private confines,
she looks on.  Her eyes 
Maia Lndmt: 	absolutely vibrant as the history unfold before her; by way of
armor:: Aah, do you have a 
Maia Lndmt: 	family weapon, or motto.. in Scotland, our colors come with a
clan crest and motto..
Martin Manderas: 	::Smiles and looks at her:: Yes, once upon a time we were
the ruling household of Sparta, ~
Martin Manderas: 	my first collection piece was the arms and armor of one of
my ancestors.  he was a scholar ~
Martin Manderas: 	of great note, mighty in arms, and rumored to use magic.
He passed on the isle of Thera ~
Martin Manderas: 	some 3400 years ago or so.  ::moves with her to the display
with bronze armor and a small~
Martin Manderas: 	sword in the hand of the figure, the crest on the cloak
which is a bit tattered and thin in~
Martin Manderas: 	spots is that of hand with a trident centered in the palm::
This began it all.
Maia Lndmt: 	Hm..::Tilting her head, she absorbs every detail of the two
items:: and the blood of the man
Maia Lndmt: 	who carried these in battle...his blood pulses through you;
isn't that fascinating...
Martin Manderas: 	Yes it is, though dilluted somewhat.  Do you like m'lady?
OnlineHost: 	Maia Lndmt has left the room.

Maia Lndmt: 	::Nodding quietly to his query, she stretches her pale tipped
fingers toward the 
Maia Lndmt: 	trident, head tilted at an angle to view its lines and details::
Its incrediable.. history
Maia Lndmt: 	is so intoxicating...
Martin Manderas: 	I have taken every detail into note, and traced my line
from it's beginnings, or as close ~
Martin Manderas: 	to it as possible.  This man here though was where the
interesting things began.  Long ago ~
Martin Manderas: 	he was the Prince of Sparta, though he cared little abut
titles.  Most of his time was ~
Martin Manderas: 	spent in stufy however.  Most of his time spent in Thera...
I would have liked to have ~
Martin Manderas: 	seen Thera.
Maia Lndmt: 	::At the soft nature of his voice, she was drawn to turn her
attention to his face. Watching
Maia Lndmt: 	the graceful movements of his lips as he spoke of things past
like a lover might its
Maia Lndmt: 	passion, she smiled; but quietly so.. not disturbing one moment
of his recollections::
Martin Manderas: 	You see, Menelaus was rather odd for his time.  As an
example, he met a young lady in the ~
Martin Manderas: 	Forum in Thera.  She was a bit of a trouble maker and was
taunting the Priest fo Zeus, ~
Martin Manderas: 	saying that Zeus came to her in the night and had affairs
with her.  This was of course ~
Martin Manderas: 	after the typical deity debates in the forum.  Well this
priest was angered and raised his ~
Martin Manderas: 	hand to strike her down, but Menelaus intercepted and
brought a cudgel down onto his arm.  ~
Martin Manderas: 	Confused as to his motive he grabbed the girl and drug her
away.  They got to know each ~
Martin Manderas: 	other and found a common spark of knowledge and free
thinking.  So what does Menelaus do?  ~
Martin Manderas: 	He uses part of his money to set her up with her own home
in Thera, with servents and all ~
Martin Manderas: 	and orders her scrolls to study... something unheard of at
the time... reading women.
Martin Manderas: 	::chuckling he looks at the armor and smiles:: He was
always in trouble with her.
Maia Lndmt: 	::She watches him a moment longer, than looks as he does back to
the armor:: You really do 
Maia Lndmt: 	know a great deal about your history, it appears I should study
my own more closely.. ::Her 
Maia Lndmt: 	eyes dancing beyond that then, to some of the other pieces as
she moves that way::
Martin Manderas: 	I have spent billions on this part of my life, learning and
collecting.  Ask about any of ~
Martin Manderas: 	them and I could give you information.  At times I can
almost hear them teaching me my ~
Martin Manderas: 	history when I sit in here alone at night.  I can almost
hear their voices.
Martin Manderas: 	Of course, now you prbably think me a loon.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Her laughter is carried on an exhales, as she continues her
study but pauses to glance his
Maia Lndmt: 	way briefly:: On the contrary, I think it is very sane to hear
the voices of our ancestors..
Maia Lndmt: 	::tapping her fingers at the base of her throat, she smiles:: I
do much the same thing with 
Maia Lndmt: 	art work, though they are not my blood.. I can almost hear the
passion, and story
Maia Lndmt: 	that bleed from the artists hands when they created each piece..
Martin Manderas: 	::He looks at her and tilts his head slightly as he
blinks:: Do you now?  I've lost several~
Martin Manderas: 	dates over that very statement.  That's why I keep to
myself mostly, some find me disturbing
Martin Manderas: 	for some reason.  
Maia Lndmt: 	::Strolling forward, she does not hesitate to peruse all that
appeals to her.. listening, 
Maia Lndmt: 	and casting her well lit eyes in his direction from time to time
in coy contact:: I find 
Maia Lndmt: 	any creature, that thrives by the hand of passion..
fascinating..
Martin Manderas: 	::makes his way through the displays in a contrasting
pattern, his eyes trained on her and ~
Martin Manderas: 	contact being broken only as he passes another testament to
his overlong existance:: I must~
Martin Manderas: 	admit that I do indeed find you fascinating Lady Maia.  Few
people share my interest as you~
Martin Manderas: 	do.  I hate to be more forward, but I would like for you to
visit me again.
Martin Manderas: 	(to be forward)
Maia Lndmt: 	I should find that most agreeable, Martin.. I visit the city
often.. ::having completed
Maia Lndmt: 	a full circle amongst his displays, she arrives once again to
face him. Sweeping firekissed 
Maia Lndmt: 	strands from her lash, to cast her eyes upward::
Martin Manderas: 	::His amber eyes fall to hers and he reaches forward to
take her hand lightly in his own, ~
Martin Manderas: 	raising it to place a gentle kiss on the center knuckle::
It must be late for you, I ~
Martin Manderas: 	shouldn't keep you from whoever is so fortunate to hold
your heart.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Turning her hand even in his ginger grasp, she draws her touch
to his chin, brushing it
Maia Lndmt: 	gently; letting their eyes greet one anothe without vocal
interuption:: You will find me a 
Maia Lndmt: 	night owl, in her best... but no doubt my visit is overstayed,
and for this I do apologize..
Maia Lndmt: 	::knowing she could easily stay and listen to story after story
until the sun rose::
Martin Manderas: 	No, you are welcome here at any length of time and for any
reason, my home is open to you.~
Martin Manderas: 	I must admit that I haven't had such good company in a very
long time.  Such a thing is ~
Martin Manderas: 	relished by an old hermit such as myself. ::With that he
smiles and gets a laughing twinkle~
Martin Manderas: 	in his eyes::  If it is not too late, would you care to see
the rest of the house?
Maia Lndmt: 	Are you a hermit sire, in such a city as this I will be most
inclined now to cause you to 
Maia Lndmt: 	venture out more.. to see what brilliance is, when modern and
old unite in one bustling 
Maia Lndmt: 	marriage.  New Oreleans.   ::And having already intented to
stay, so long as he likes.. she 
Maia Lndmt: 	graces a gentle bow in his respect, before turning and strolling
toward the door.  A quiet, 
Maia Lndmt: 	and very slowed step to allow him to take the lead::
Martin Manderas: 	I take that as a yes, to the continued tour?  ::smiling he
makes his way to her and holds ~
Martin Manderas: 	out his arm for her::  I would explore this fine city, but
I am not one for venturing out ~
Martin Manderas: 	alone.  My habits and style is far too antiquated for this
day and age.
Maia Lndmt: 	Then a thousand pretty maidens could be called out to join you,
of this I hold no doubt..
Maia Lndmt: 	::Her eyes moving animatedly over his profile, as she takes his
arm, each time with a more
Maia Lndmt: 	warm and relaxed caress and security:: and aye, I would very
much like to see your home in 
Maia Lndmt: 	all its glory.. for in a home, a master can be discovered...
Martin Manderas: 	A thousand pretty maidens I don't want, I prefer to keep
myself in company that I ~
Martin Manderas: 	enjoy.  ::Making his way throught he roman parlor, he
passes back into the foyer and ~
Martin Manderas: 	across the hall into a large dining room, set up very much
like a Gaelic Feast Hall, the ~
Martin Manderas: 	table is thick and sturdy and the walls are bricked over
and the fireplace seems ready to ~
Martin Manderas: 	cook on.  Everything is styled with finery, but in a rather
rough made standard:: My Celtic~
Martin Manderas: 	hall... My family only had the most scant dealings with
them, and even intermingled a bit, ~
Martin Manderas: 	but for the most part it is my own fascination.
Maia Lndmt: 	Fascination.. ::Her gaze flitters over every inch of detail,
consuming both color and 
Maia Lndmt: 	natural affects.  Remaining, less boldly at his arm now as she
looks about:: Pray tell me 
Maia Lndmt: 	what you find fascinating... 
Maia Lndmt: 	:: A sparkle in her highland eyes, as she awaits his response::
Martin Manderas: 	The strength of the people, and the natural beauty of them.
Such strong and powerful~
Martin Manderas: 	people, but in each and every one of them is engrained an
artistic wonder, their music and ~
Martin Manderas: 	their speech is all wrought with mystic wonder and
excitement, and even at their most ~
Martin Manderas: 	savage times they are beutifully historic and magestically
passionate.
Maia Lndmt: 	Aye.. do you think it is by such hardship that men are born?
::her gaze lowering some in
Maia Lndmt: 	distant thought:: a refiners fire, so constant as has been the
fires of the Celtic.. Gaelic 
Maia Lndmt: 	and other highland races, is bound to bring forth eternal flames
of love, hatred, hope and 
Maia Lndmt: 	long suffering.  Aye.  ::she smiles, closing her eyes:: I can
see we share a love of many 
Maia Lndmt: 	things..
Martin Manderas: 	I have always loved the Highlanders, all of the Celtic
people... you have stumbled on yet ~
Martin Manderas: 	another weakness of mine.  That Fae blood that apparently
runs through the veins of your ~
Martin Manderas: 	people is like a sirens call to me.  The Blood of the
Tuatha De Dannan is beautiful to me.
Martin Manderas: 	I am lost in its presence, I remember the first.....
Scottish lady I ever met.
Maia Lndmt: 	I am very flattered by such complimentary speach, even though I
am yet only distantly the 
Maia Lndmt: 	focus of your interest. ::the air seems to still sweetly around
them, it is as if the 
Maia Lndmt: 	recollections of many have been summoned by these relics,
smiling she waits a moment before 
Maia Lndmt: 	bidding him share his memory:: She must have been amarvel, I see
her affects still upon your
Maia Lndmt: 	soul...
Martin Manderas: 	Oh she was, full of fire she was.  Hair very much like
yours, pale soft skin.  She was ~
Martin Manderas: 	fiesty beyond words and her father as stubborn as an Ox.
He refused to allow us to see ~
Martin Manderas: 	each other because I wasn't a good Scottsman.  ::He
chuckles and looks at the scnonces on ~
Martin Manderas: 	the wall and the Tartan hanging on the rear wall::  She got
her way though, she told her ~
Martin Manderas: 	father that if he didn't allow it she would never marry and
become a Bean Sidhe and haunt ~
Martin Manderas: 	the family for all eternity.  I guess that means something,
but he gave us freedom, knowing~
Martin Manderas: 	that her fancy would be skewed to someone else before long.
Maia Lndmt: 	Ah, and superstition is so heavily carried in those hills..
::his story not all that 
Maia Lndmt: 	different than her own, and its connection is gently apparant as
she casts her gaze across 
Maia Lndmt: 	the room as he weaves the story, and the untold ending:: but a
mans worth is not his blood, 
Maia Lndmt: 	for every man has nobility and worth mingled within.. it is what
he does with that blood, 
Maia Lndmt: 	that makes him worth loving.  I married a 'fine Scotsman'....
and a man has never treated me
Maia Lndmt: 	less kindly and fine, in all my years.  ::her voice quiets, as
that was highly too much 
Maia Lndmt: 	information to admit, in the presence of one yet so unknown.. so
what is left but to disarm 
Maia Lndmt: 	him with a smile, and gesture toward the tartan:: What Clan
belongs to these colors?
Martin Manderas: 	::His voice rings out in a perfect Scottish Brogue:: Aye
Lass, thaes are the colors of Clan~
Martin Manderas: 	MacEwan, the woonderful famly that my wee Brigit came from.
I will never forget them, and ~
Martin Manderas: 	I would like to apologize on behalf of all decent men that
someone treated ya badly.  It ~
Martin Manderas: 	should never happen to such a fair sprite like yerself.
Martin Manderas: 	::With that he smiles and touches her cheek softly, his
voice back to normal:: I spent a ~
Martin Manderas: 	few years in Edinburough.
Maia Lndmt: 	::She smiles at the beautiful accents, every word causing a hint
of gentle stain
Maia Lndmt: 	her features; like the final few strokes that make an artists
rendition complete.  Glad for 
Maia Lndmt: 	his effort, and touched by his apology she merely tips her head
accepting it for the sake of
Maia Lndmt: 	all pain past.:: My clan comes from Oban.. MacDougal, one of the
sons of Somerled
Maia Lndmt: 	Who opposed Robert the Bruce, and who died on many battle
fields, but non less driven by 
Maia Lndmt: 	their loyalty to the true king of Scotland...
Martin Manderas: 	I am sorry if I have offended m'lady... I simply meant to
bring out my own true feelings ~
Martin Manderas: 	about how ashamed that I am that any man has hurt you.  If
you think I was mocking your ~
Martin Manderas: 	heritage I assure you that I would do no such thing,
especially to one like yourself.
Martin Manderas: 	::With that he drops to a knee, head bowed and hand going
to the hem of her dress asking ~
Martin Manderas: 	for forgiveness::
Maia Lndmt: 	Och.. Martin.. ::the own natural tones of her crooning voice,
seems slightly more elevated 
Maia Lndmt: 	at this humbling display.  A hand responsively touching over the
crow of his bowed head, 
Maia Lndmt: 	easing a few of the rich fibers with her twining fingertips:: I
did nae think that at all, 
Maia Lndmt: 	not ever... would I consider such mockery from you. I am not so
easily offended, but I 
Maia Lndmt: 	feel I should join you upon your knee's.  Asking you to forgive
me for appearing thus 
Maia Lndmt: 	offended..
Martin Manderas: 	No M'lady... I will stand on your leave, so long as you
wish it.  I would never want to see~
Martin Manderas: 	such a hurt in your eyes again, it almost broke my heart in
twain... do you forgive me?
Maia Lndmt: 	Then I shall be more kind in my recollections, you feel so
much.. it could verily take
Maia Lndmt: 	my breath from me, but do not change it.  ::Her knee's folding
just enough, that she may 
Maia Lndmt: 	slide one hand beneath his right arm and urge him to stand to
his fully height once more:: 
Maia Lndmt: 	If you needed my forgiveness you would have it, even before it
was needed..
Martin Manderas: 	::With a heavy intake of breath he stands and looks into
her eyes:: You are too kind to me~
Martin Manderas: 	even though we just met, I must say that I feel like we are
long time friends.  Should we ~
Martin Manderas: 	move along?
Maia Lndmt: 	::She chortles softly, nodding to his query with bided
anticipation:: Perhaps we knew each 
Maia Lndmt: 	other in another life, we only just now have to learn less
formality.. aye?
MeneIaus: 	::Once again he holds out his arm for her, waiting to continue the tour:: Perhaps, but it's~
MeneIaus: 	not likely... would be nice to think that once we looked over a sunset together.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Having fell into an ease with her guide, she joins him once again, her hand curled
Maia Lndmt: 	around the strength of his limb and her eyes already dancing forward across the treasures
Maia Lndmt: 	forthcoming.  His comment, sweetly said but somewhat saddening causing a quiet withdrawal of
Maia Lndmt: 	her gaze to the carpet beneath them; she nodded::  Such natural wonders are meant to be 
Maia Lndmt: 	shared.. no doubt...
MeneIaus: 	Yes they are, even the simpler things are turned into something spectacular when shared ~
MeneIaus: 	good company... ::He moves out of the dining hall and back to the central hall, climbing ~
MeneIaus: 	stairs lazily with her, all the while taking quick glances of her and smiling::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Not at all unaware of his stolen glances, she retains a coy approach not returning his
Maia Lndmt: 	inviting considerations but rather lifts her dainty, yet proud chin to cast a floating gaze 
Maia Lndmt: 	over every detail as it comes into view.  A tickling strand of crimson, slips along her 
Maia Lndmt: 	cheek between them; enhancing the blush that has seemed to settle permanently in her 
Maia Lndmt: 	features.:: (s) so tell me.. with all of your relics and history, do you share you home with
Maia Lndmt: 	spectres perhaps?
MeneIaus: 	No, Spectres care not for this place it seems... something that I am glad to say for I care~
MeneIaus: 	none too much for them in equal measure.  These Relics are either purchased or passed down.~
MeneIaus: 	::Cresting the winding stairs he heads straight back with her, his hand pushing open a set ~
MeneIaus: 	of finely crafted double doors, the slight creek breaks the conversation and the smell of ~
MeneIaus: 	old paper washes over them both.  Old leathers, old papers... old books fill their vision. ~
MeneIaus: 	His Library::  This is the Library.
Maia Lndmt: 	(vs) we are all spectres to something... ::her own response suddenly distracted, and before 
Maia Lndmt: 	eyes have chance to feast on the display the scent so familiar and personal to her causes 
Maia Lndmt: 	her steps to cease directly.  Letting the scent and imagination of leagons of books fill her
Maia Lndmt: 	thoughts as she lifts her chest to a fulfilling inhaling.  A flutter of lash is followed by 
Maia Lndmt: 	her focus and she smiles easily enchanted:: No.. 'tis heaven... the kind I wish to dwell in.
MeneIaus: 	::The books go from newest close to the front to the oldest in the rear, the diamond ~
MeneIaus: 	patterned case in the rear holding none other than scrolls, all glass cased and airtight:: ~
MeneIaus: 	This is yet another pride of my collection... I have writings from as far back as the ~
MeneIaus: 	1400's BC.  Most of this collection has been cared for and passed from father to son...
Maia Lndmt: 	::She nods quietly, looking toward him knowing the very manner in which such a collection
Maia Lndmt: 	is gathered.  The thought of his love for literature tucked into the gentle confines of her 
Maia Lndmt: 	consciousness; as another shared attribute.  As her eyes drift from spine to spine of the
Maia Lndmt: 	older section of books.  Titles appearing in her thoughts:: I gave some of my collection 
Maia Lndmt: 	away this year... a single book for everyone I loved.  
MeneIaus: 	That's admirable, giving something of esteemed value to you for a higher purpose shows ~
MeneIaus: 	a caring heart.  Have you ever feasted your eyes on a scroll from a civilization that no ~
MeneIaus: 	longer exists?  Not in Geography or society? ::Moving back to the scrolls along the back ~
MeneIaus: 	wall::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Quoting the very reason behind her gifts:: "Rings and jewels are not gifts, they are 
Maia Lndmt: 	excuses for gifts.  The only true gift, is a portion of thyself" ::Looking along the rows 
Maia Lndmt: 	with encouraged curiosity she moves in matched grace, to his every step:: Please, show me..
MeneIaus: 	Do you know of Thera?  The island in the mediteranean that was sunk due to a volcanoe?
Maia Lndmt: 	Aye.. I have heard the legand.. ::A touch of lash to her cheek, as she shifts her attention 
Maia Lndmt: 	from the library to his face; fixing her gaze to him quietly::
MeneIaus: 	::A hand reaches down and taps a few buttons on a panel and the sound of air being ~
MeneIaus: 	released is heard as the glass doors part.  With a finger he pulls one open and steps ~
MeneIaus: 	inside the room with her and over to a desk, motioning for her to sit down::  Most of these~
MeneIaus: 	are letters from one to another, there is also a map, and a few sermons on the qualities ~
MeneIaus: 	of the Gods... philosophy, I have it all.
MeneIaus: 	Which would you care to see first?
Maia Lndmt: 	::Following as directed, she withdraws her light touch from his arm and settles within the 
Maia Lndmt: 	gracious confines of a chair.  Watching him as yet, and not the room.  Curling her hands w
Maia Lndmt: 	within her lap, like a quiet student she smiles:: the qualities of the gods.. hm.. perhaps, 
Maia Lndmt: 	but a correspondance between two persons would claim my curiosity; words exchanged in
Maia Lndmt: 	pen can hold such power...
MeneIaus: 	::Smiles and pulls out a few scrolls for her, to her surprise they are supple and smell of ~
MeneIaus: 	oils and herbs.  He steps over to her and sets them down in front of her, and sits on the ~
MeneIaus: 	corner of the desk to watch her as she reads:: These are from my ancestor Menelaus and his ~
MeneIaus: 	gypsy woman that he met in the forum... love letters mostly.
Maia Lndmt: 	Ah, I confess I had hoped they would be... ::her eyes touch over his breifly, letting a 
Maia Lndmt: 	moment of silence between them before she reaches with a gardners hand to take up the first;
Maia Lndmt: 	gingerly unwinding it as if it were egg shell.  The scent setting a mood for the words about
Maia Lndmt: 	to be shared::
MeneIaus: 	::The first is a letter from Menelaus, apparently left for her as he left the pallazo ~
MeneIaus: 	hastily.  It's in greek, and tells of how his father called him home to Sparta, his sister ~
MeneIaus: 	was ill and in case of something tragic the prince should be present...  much apologies and~
MeneIaus: 	talk of missing her until he returns and how she needs not worry for anyting while he is ~
MeneIaus: 	gone, all her food and clothing will be paid for in advance::
Maia Lndmt: 	It pleases me aye.. should it not? ::Her question one that does not require an answer, as 
Maia Lndmt: 	she embarkes on the next scroll.  Less exchange between them as she becomes more
Maia Lndmt: 	engrossed by the story unfolding.  A smile, brief but gentle at a loyalty she once
Maia Lndmt: 	knew herself.  She sets it with the others::
MeneIaus: 	::Then next scrolls folow the same line, there are 32 in all speaking back and forth from ~
MeneIaus: 	Thera and Sparta, Thera and Egypt, Thera and Mycenai... Menelaus apparently travels ~
MeneIaus: 	frequently doing duties for his king, his father.  Dione stays in Thera, in the villa that ~
MeneIaus: 	was paid for by Menelaus with servants hired and foodstuff bought.  Luxuries given, and ~
MeneIaus: 	every need taken care of for her.  The last one is from Dione, tragic and rather frantic, ~
MeneIaus: 	she speaks of a man she met and an illness befalling her, the soothsayers and Chirurgeons ~
MeneIaus: 	foretell death for her::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Her breath is caught, naturally and with ease as she continues now to read each piece 
Maia Lndmt: 	without her previous hesitation.  Noting the many locations of the absent lover, a pause as 
Maia Lndmt: 	she glances toward Martin.  She says nothing but she wonders.. if this women was loved, but 
Maia Lndmt: 	held captive by his many departures; much like she had been.  Nothing is confessed, as she  
Maia Lndmt: 	reaches for the final scroll in the series.  Her countanance softening, as her lips part
Maia Lndmt: 	slightly::  
MeneIaus: 	Yes, I should have warned you about the sad ending.  My Forefather indeed had a strange love
MeneIaus: 	for this woman Dione.  The story is typical for the time though.  Except for the station of~
MeneIaus: 	the loers in society.. something like that was risque' to say the least.
Maia Lndmt: 	Aye.. ::easing the scroll back into its trained funnel, she places it with the others and 
Maia Lndmt: 	turns so she may fully read his expression:: Did he return then... ?
MeneIaus: 	Of course he did...  ::Reaches out to grab another set of scrolls::  This is his journal of~
MeneIaus: 	his last two days alive.  This ends the Theran Chronicles..
Maia Lndmt: 	::Her brow forms a small pucker over her gaze, as she looks to the final few
Maia Lndmt: 	pieces to a tragic story:: (s) his.. death.. not her's?
MeneIaus: 	Read... ::He smiles at her again, brushing a finger across her cheek.  and will quote ~
MeneIaus: 	directly from the scrolls::  ~ I have returned to her, only to find her worse than I had ~
MeneIaus: 	imagined.  Her eyes are sunken and hollow, and her skin like sheets of white silk.  The ~
MeneIaus: 	Apothecaries and Soothsayers can do nothing for her but speak ill omens.  The Priests refuse
MeneIaus: 	to go near her.  All I am left with is my own magics, practiced since I was a boy.  None of~
MeneIaus: 	it is working though.  When I went to the forum earlier a soothsayer there blanched as he ~
MeneIaus: 	looked upon me and claimed to all the wolrd that I would be the fall of Thera, and ran off ~
MeneIaus: 	maddened as the guards hacked him down for speaking against nobility.  I returned to Dione ~
MeneIaus: 	quickly and with discontenet on my brow.  She got worse... I tried everything all through ~
MeneIaus: 	the night until I passed out on the dawn of the next morn...  When I awoke she was all but ~
MeneIaus: 	gone.  Still beautiful, but there was little or no color to her skin anylonger, and she ~
MeneIaus: 	laid there in a feverish haze.  There was one last resort for him... to call upon Hades ~
MeneIaus: 	God of the Underworld... to plea for her life... with my own if needed.  I must prepare.
Maia Lndmt: 	::Her lashes fall as does her gaze, as slowly she partakes of the story's conclusion.  A
MeneIaus: 	::here the handwriting gets shakey and rather jumbled:: She has gone, tonight she died... ~
Maia Lndmt: 	(ack)
MeneIaus: 	There was nothing I could do...Hades made a deal... if I unleashe every ounce of power I ~
MeneIaus: 	have he will send her back to me.  So tonight I will throw out every ounce of magic in me ~
MeneIaus: 	and free it to the world, I will become a mortal man for her.
Maia Lndmt: 	::A fingertip tracing habitually along the crease between pressed lips as she reads.  Not 
Maia Lndmt: 	wanting to hear of deals made with the devil.. not wanting to be reminded of Memnoch and his
Maia Lndmt: 	binds with hell.  She closes her eyes, but still his voice continues on and every word wraps
Maia Lndmt: 	around her with grave affect.  A sliver of a tear breaks loose from her lash, and trickles 
Maia Lndmt: 	over a cheek now made pallid.  She exhales, a breath she had kept all the while within her 
Maia Lndmt: 	throat as her eyes open and she looks to him; the last scroll still gently clasp in her 
Maia Lndmt: 	hand:: (s) You read it so.. personally... ::the undeinable look of wondernment dancing 
Maia Lndmt: 	within her moistened orbs::
Maia Lndmt: 	(read=quote)
MeneIaus: 	I have read more than a thousand times....  it is my forefather... my families first great ~
MeneIaus: 	tragedy.  It's a part of me.  Just to finish it up, that night is when Thera fell into the ~
MeneIaus: 	Ocean...  Menelaus and Dione bot sank with it as far as it has ever been known.  So they ~
MeneIaus: 	say... he showed up once as the Husband of Helen of Troy once.
Maia Lndmt: 	Immortal then... ::not questioningly oddly enough, she lays the scroll aside and stares a 
Maia Lndmt: 	moment in contemplation at the clusters of parchment that retain what most would deem a
Maia Lndmt: 	fictional fable of sorts.  Touched both by the love Menelaus had for Dione.. but also piqued
Maia Lndmt: 	by the man before her; his unfaltering belief.  Her gaze drops before arching over his 
Maia Lndmt: 	face once more:: (s) what a treasure you have there... 
MeneIaus: 	Thank you, I take pride in the more than 3000 years of recorded history of my family and ~
MeneIaus: 	who we are.  it's a curiosity of sorts.  Starting with Menelaus and most likely ending with~
MeneIaus: 	myself.  Very tragic indeed.  ::Smiles and places a hand on her, patting it once before he ~
MeneIaus: 	gives it a gentle squeeze:: Once again you sit someplace that no other human has ever sat ~
MeneIaus: 	save one.  Myself.
Maia Lndmt: 	Nothing is ended.. if its recorded; it is the only true
immortality. The word. ::her eyes 
Maia Lndmt: 	fall over the rhythmetic introduction of his touch to her hand,
and she smiles at his 
Maia Lndmt: 	comment.. a soft smile that blooms to a bemused one::  You
assume my humanity.. ::she 
Maia Lndmt: 	touches her eyes to his, a lifted brow very subtle:: 
MeneIaus: 	You are far to beautiful to be an animal, and your head isn't
shaped right for an Alien... ~
MeneIaus: 	So I will have to deduce humanity for the moment ::He smiles at
her and twinks his nose ~
MeneIaus: 	once and his eyes glitter::
Maia Lndmt: 	I am the namesake of the goddess Maia.. does that not make a
portion of me eternal? ::her 
Maia Lndmt: 	tones are equally playful to his own, as she only tantalizes the
topic with a man she is 
Maia Lndmt: 	more and more intruiged by.  Letting her lithe figure fall back
further into the embrace of 
Maia Lndmt: 	the chair, she touches her head to its back.. gazing upward:: I
am glad though Martin.. to 
Maia Lndmt: 	be sharing this place with you then, we alone for now...
MeneIaus: 	Yes, at this hour the manservants are gone, so it is just you and
I alone here.  Your name ~
MeneIaus: 	is eternal, but are you?  Had my father given me the name Menelaus
when I was born, would I~
MeneIaus: 	be eternal?
Maia Lndmt: 	(s) Did he.... ::The query a bold one, but none the less offered
as she retains her quiet
Maia Lndmt: 	incline and position.  The spare digits of her right hand
trickling along the edge of the
Maia Lndmt: 	chairs arm::
MeneIaus: 	Yes...  All males in my family are named after him.
Maia Lndmt: 	::A color touching her lips, before it spreads to her cheeks.
She sits upright, to allow a 
Maia Lndmt: 	look to be exchanged:: Then aye... I consider at least a portion
of you to be eternal..
Maia Lndmt: 	::Rising from the chair in languid grace, she ponders in the
depth of the room
MeneIaus: 	Fascinating... so are youhuman?
Maia Lndmt: 	what hour it is exactly.  Her gaze floating, almost seductively
between his fixed eyes:: 
Maia Lndmt: 	Aren't we all...?
MeneIaus: 	No...  not all are.
Maia Lndmt: 	Aye.. but we all live amongst them, and participate in life as
human.  I guess one will 
Maia Lndmt: 	never be able to shift these from the others.  ::Her words as
evasive, and soft as his as 
Maia Lndmt: 	she touches the pads of her fingertips along her waistline.
Dipping her hand into the 
Maia Lndmt: 	pocket to retrive a glistening, antique watch.  Her focus not
withdrawn for a space of time,
Maia Lndmt: 	until.. the silence is extremely sweet.  She cheeks the hour::
(s) The dawn arrives soon... 
MeneIaus: 	We?  So you are saying that you only pose as human?
MeneIaus: 	I should let you go then, it is a late hour and I feel foolish for
keeping you this long.
Maia Lndmt: 	I have neither confessed or invited any conclusion.. ::the watch
is slipped from view once 
Maia Lndmt: 	again as she moves closer, letting only the air become barrier
between them:: I would stay 
Maia Lndmt: 	many hours in your company.. but I do not venture in the
daylight.  It is so revealing in a 
Maia Lndmt: 	city such as this... ::her eyes warm as her does her smile::
Maia Lndmt: 	and it steals away its charm..
MeneIaus: 	I could set you up with a guest room here if you would trust me?
I will even allow you to ~
MeneIaus: 	lock your door from the inside if that makes you feel safe.
Maia Lndmt: 	Do I have need to fear you entry? ::the thought does tickle
through her mind a moment, 
Maia Lndmt: 	knowing the hour has grown mightily close to danger::
Maia Lndmt: 	(your entry even)
MeneIaus: 	That is for you to decide, I know that I wouldn't enter the
sleeping chambers of a lady ~
MeneIaus: 	wothout invitation, and I would hope that you would trust me.  But
we are such newly met ~
MeneIaus: 	friends.
Maia Lndmt: 	Aye.. that we are and so much is revealed with time.. ::turning
toward the door in which
Maia Lndmt: 	they entered, she hesitates to glance across her shoulder:: I
have a servent, who would stay
Maia Lndmt: 	with me... just outside, if you would not mind terribly?
MeneIaus: 	I mind not at all...  feel free to invite them to visit, Xavier
will be here shortly and ~
MeneIaus: 	 will show him the way.  ::Holds his arm to take her to her
sleeping chamber::
Maia Lndmt: 	::Curling her hand once more into place upon his offered arm she
smiles and nods to the 
Maia Lndmt: 	arrangement:: Anything inside of the house would be most
pleasing, a window might distract 
Maia Lndmt: 	my rest....
MeneIaus: 	I understand completely.  so it shall be done.  ::Walks her to the
left out past the door ~
MeneIaus: 	and down the hall a ways, finally coming to a large thick wooden
door and opening it.  The ~
MeneIaus: 	design is Vctorian with drapery and a four poster bed with Canopy
and all, the window is ~
MeneIaus: 	covered in draperies and a picture of some sorts... overall the
place seesm safe and secure~
MeneIaus: 	:: Here you go M'Lady, that door over there leades to a washroom
if you need to freshen up~
MeneIaus: 	and there should be various gowns in the closet in case you wish
to slip into something ~
MeneIaus: 	easier to sleep in.  For now I will leave you to your rest, for it
certainly isn't beauty ~
MeneIaus: 	that you need more of ::Lifts her hand and kisses her knuckle::
Maia Lndmt: 	::She unwinds her hand, and steps into the chamber.. turning
with a smiling gaze:: Nyles 
Maia Lndmt: 	has been prompted to bring some of my items.. he shall arrive
shortly.  It should be easy to
Maia Lndmt: 	sleep in such elegance.. will you be here when I awake?
MeneIaus: 	I will be in the house, yes.  Here, most likely not.. I don't
think we are that good of ~
MeneIaus: 	friends yet. ::Flashes a devilish smile and turns to go to his own
chambers:: Till the ~
MeneIaus: 	morrow my enchanting lady.
Maia Lndmt: 	::She chortles softly:: I did mean in the home.. it will be
obvious soon that Nyles does not
Maia Lndmt: 	allow visitors... ::she watches him turn:: goodnight Menalaus...
Maia Lndmt: 	(Menelaus)
OnlineHost: 	Maia Lndmt has left the room.
