listen in silence, the ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	same degree of repuslion settling in him as when he watched them<BR>
together::<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::quietly she sits, her eyes never daring to leave the form<BR>
of the Senator.  there is<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	a visible twitch once or twice at the corners of her mouth<BR>
when the Senator's seal is<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	placed upon the parchment.:: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	::A smiles creeps across his lips and the cloak turns and begins<BR>
heading across the sky, ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	building after building passes beneath them as the move towards<BR>
the luscious outer ring of ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	the island, home to the beaches and lush orchards that support it.<BR>
Short moments later the~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	cloak lands upon the beach and he stands and steps away in<BR>
thought::<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::shaken from the airborne flight - knees weak at the<BR>
prospect of the earth once more <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	beneath her.::<w>   Very interesting mode of flight m'lord.<BR>
::her voice catching in her <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	throat with these simple words::  What other illusions does<BR>
my lover possess? <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Not illusions Dione, though I wish I had such powers, and I wish I<BR>
had seen them recently.<BR>
MeneIaus: 	::His back still to her and his hand running through the long dark<BR>
locks flowing from his~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	head::<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::a hand, placed gently upon his shouder.  there was a soft<BR>
clink of the metal bracelet that<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	hung from her wrist.:: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Do I seem in discontent my fairest flower?  Saved from the ravages<BR>
of madmen so long ago?  ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	Do I seem like my heart needs lifting?  Perhaps I do, your friend<BR>
seems to be playing well.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	He . . .  intrigues me.  ::a light step up behind him and<BR>
she presses herself up against his<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	back.::  Does the game start so soon ?  Shall we jump upon<BR>
the board of mischeif once more <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	before even a proper welcoming to your home is given?<BR>
::sighs and lays her check against <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	his back.:: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	The game started long ago Dione, you are just now entering the<BR>
board. ::turning he takes ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	her face softly in his hand and peers into her eyes:: I had hoped<BR>
you to be an Ally to me, ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	but if you choose to play against me, then that cannot be.  And<BR>
who cares about this ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	Senator?  There is a reason his wife will not sleep with him, and<BR>
she had to turn to more ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	viril alternatives.  Not to mention he makes a rather sad pawn<BR>
indeed.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::ebony eyes narrow::  Viril alternatives?  Then it is true<BR>
- you have bedded her.  For most<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	certainly you are just that; viril and alternative.  Two for<BR>
the price of one m'lord, surely<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	your senechal must be please with your marketible talents. <BR>
MeneIaus: 	What mindset has carried you to this delusion Dione?  I do not bed<BR>
women of married status,~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	not to mention... why would I spoil my royal blood with that of a<BR>
lowly Senators wife?<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Why indeed?  I have not yet been able to understand that<BR>
myself.  ::she pulls away from his <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	touch to move past him toward the breaking waves upong the<BR>
beach.:: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Because I haven't.. I would not soil myself to lay with her, I've<BR>
never even touched her.  ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	I don't lower myself to play with my pawns, I have them done by<BR>
others.  She carries no ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	child of mine, nor will she ever.  You would do well to never<BR>
accuse me of such things ever~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	again Dione.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	May the Gods forbid that you would spoil your royal blood.<BR>
::fire in her words fed by <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	the tightening in her chest - the wounded heart aching once<BR>
more from the sting of his <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	words::  Poisedion send your mermen - send your sirens ::her<BR>
voice carries out to the waters<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	lapping at her feet::   A lowly senator's wife ?  You taunt<BR>
me  - knowing that even her <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	(one drop of her )  blood is purer than mine by tenfold.<BR>
::her movements bring her about to<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	face him once more::  Tell me again how you won't bed<BR>
someone so far beneath your station <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Menelaus. <BR>
MeneIaus: 	That's not how I meant it Dione, I would not bed for the game.  I<BR>
would not spoil my seed ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	unless it was through the desires of the heart.  Do you think I<BR>
would throw you away for a ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	piece on a kings board?  Have I ever treated you like others would<BR>
treat you?  No.  I have ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	always treated you with honor and dignity.  By all the Gods on<BR>
Olympus you should know ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	better.  Perhaps I should have not returned to you, for I suspect<BR>
you find your Senator ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	more pleasing.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::dark lashes flutter. her eyes turned away from his<BR>
penetrating gaze.::  Speak no<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	(not) such things.  No one means more to me than  you.<BR>
::the early morning breeze halos out<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	the gauzy white cloth of her simple dress.::  <w>  Why do<BR>
you think I am so angry?  Because <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	once more you've bested me? ::shakes her head:: <vqw>  No .<BR>
. . because you're actions have <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	wounded me. <BR>
MeneIaus: 	What actions?  Paying a man to sleep with his wife and then a<BR>
Soothsayer to proficy his ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	downfall because of that affair?  I have told you once that I have<BR>
not touched her, not ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	even my gaze has set upon her naked shoulders.  That should<BR>
suffice.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Fine.  If you did not take her as your lover, then you<BR>
should have no concern for her life <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	nor that of her unborn child.  ::she tips her head back<BR>
definantly, her chin tiltled up in <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	the air:  I shall have Diomede continue through with his<BR>
orders then.  The Senate shall <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	certainly see fit to sacrifice the cheating whore.  <BR>
MeneIaus: 	I am sure that you would see it that way Dione.  For the Senator,<BR>
it matters not if she ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	lives or dies.  I care as much for her life as I do for the sand<BR>
beneath my feet.  The ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	Soothsayer spoke truth, he will fall if he kills her or lets her<BR>
live.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	The words of the Soothsayer can be bought as easily as a<BR>
harlot living within the rings of <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	the merchants district.  ::she waves her hand in dismisal::<BR>
Taunt me not with false <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	prophicy <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Do you think that this plan has just been made by me Dione?  This<BR>
has been in the works for~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	nearly a year.  You cannot protect him, nor can you save him.  He<BR>
will fall, and in doing ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	so you will learn a valuable lesson if you choose to become a true<BR>
player.  Never get ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	attached to a pawn.  They are far too easily taken out, something<BR>
that you will soon see~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	for yourself.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Attached?  ::her mocking laughter rings out in the early<BR>
morning, a flock of gulls disturbed<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	from their morning meal feedings protest in anger and scurry<BR>
away::  Do you honestly think <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	that I am *attached* to the Senator?  -If- he were to die<BR>
upon the morrow the only tears <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	shed from mine eyes would be for theatrics only. <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Then it won't matter when he dies by the time the sun is at its<BR>
highest peak today will you?<BR>
MeneIaus: 	When the guard finds him with the bloodied knife that stabbed his<BR>
wife through the heart in~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	his hands and gashes him from shoulder to hip for advancing on him<BR>
with a weapon.  Look me ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	in the eyes and tell me that you will not care Dione. ::Her arm is<BR>
taken and her body spun ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	to directly face him, his eyes bore into hers seeking the truth::<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Of course not.  ::spoken with confedience yet unable to look<BR>
into his eyes as she turns to <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	(turns her) face from his to look down at the grasp he has<BR>
upon her.  there is an <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	uncomfortible shift in her stance.:: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	That's what I thought... ::He pushes her arm free of him and turns<BR>
stepping away and ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	bending gracefully to scoop the cape from the sand without losing<BR>
step::<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Stop . . .  Menelaus. ::she watches his brisk retreat, a<BR>
growing seed of dread blossoming in<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	her soul:: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	::Doesn't turn to face her as he slows his pace:: So you could dig<BR>
the wound deeper?  Even ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	if I was the one to bed that wench, I wouldn't fall for her... I<BR>
wouldn't betray my heart ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	to share it with her... instead of keeping it whole in your hands.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	The heart that beats within my breast belongs only to you<BR>
m'lord.  Never . . . ::advances <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	upon him, stopping but a few scant feet away:: Ever forget<BR>
that.  If I could halt the <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	rising of the sun with but a motion  of my hand to prove<BR>
this I would. <BR>
MeneIaus: 	But you share your heart with him, and he loves you does he not?<BR>
Are not your lips there ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	but for his desire?  ::The words dig deep from their conversation<BR>
earlier this evening, the~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	quote nearly exact in wording::<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::her face blanches - curses against Aprhodite are thought::<BR>
Words Menelaus - merely words.<BR>
MeneIaus: 	Your own eyes betrayed you Dione, your own actions.  The look on<BR>
your face when he touched ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	you... how you trembled as he spoke of his loss of honor for you.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::her head shakes back - a liquid tumble of black curls<BR>
cascade down her back and <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	shoulders:: <w> You spied upon us . . . and you - you<BR>
believed the lies as easily as he. ~<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::the tip of her tongue wets her lips:: I am pleased that my<BR>
preformance was so convincing. <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Don't try to cover it now Dione, you couldn't even look me in the<BR>
eyes.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	You laid your hands upon me - never before have you ever<BR>
laid your hands on me in any such <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	way. ::she pauses - her hand reaches out for him:: Look at<BR>
me - peer into the depth of my <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	eyes now and see that it is the truth that I speak.  <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Now that you have time to harden yourself and find your mettle.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Shall I take the knife then - cut the death wound upon his<BR>
chest with my own hands to prove <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	it to you? <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Would I suffer you to put yourself into mortal danger for my<BR>
hearts sake?  No.  <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	So once more we fall to an impass m'lord.  ::she nods her<BR>
head and gentle reverance::  So I <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	must take your words to heart as the truth - and you must do<BR>
the same for me.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	( bleh  - that should be -in gentle reverence- ) <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Must I?  And what now?  The Senator dies soon?  You still haven't<BR>
explained your ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	involvement with him.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Should I?  Do I demand that you release to me priviledge<BR>
information on your pawns.  ~<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	I think not - only when I am about to be bested do you tell<BR>
me of your wiley schemes.  ~<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::pauses::  Do not think that just because the waters<BR>
carried you away from from my bed - <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	away from your house - that it makes you a stranger to me<BR>
Menelaus. <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Those same waters carried me back apparently in time to prevent<BR>
that same bed from being ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	shared by someone else.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::no longer can she continue this arguement - as always<BR>
before to spar words with him in the<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	heat of emotion was something she could not continue for any<BR>
length of time.  her shoulders <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	slump slighty - not in defeat by any means but rather to<BR>
quietly conceed to disagree without<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	further insult. :: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	::His hand lifts to cup her cheek again, lifting her face to him::<BR>
What am I to do with you?<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	The same thing that you have always done with me.  ::she<BR>
refuses to allow even a tear drop <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	to form in her eyes:: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Carry you home and attend to your needs?<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::a gentle smile crosses her lips:: Well . . .  there was the time that you were so angery<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	that I found myself without home nor possession. ::her hand comes up to trail fingers <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	through the loosen tangles of hair along his head:: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	That was your fault though... Come, lets return home, I am tired.<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	Of course you would see it that way Menelaus. ::repeating almost word for word his own <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	statement :: <BR>
MeneIaus: 	Est solaries, divinus aero ::he speaks the words and scoops her in his arms and is brought ~<BR>
MeneIaus: 	into the air, holding her close to his chest::<BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	::this time- the shaking of her limbs is not from the vertigo in which she feels as she <BR>
Tana Scarletti: 	wraps herself around his body:: </I></HTML>
