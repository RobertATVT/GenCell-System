MeneIaus: 	::The flying cloak flutters lightly in the night as they foat and
listen in silence, the ~
MeneIaus: 	same degree of repuslion settling in him as when he watched them
together::
Tana Scarletti: 	::quietly she sits, her eyes never daring to leave the form
of the Senator.  there is
Tana Scarletti: 	a visible twitch once or twice at the corners of her mouth
when the Senator's seal is
Tana Scarletti: 	placed upon the parchment.:: 
MeneIaus: 	::A smiles creeps across his lips and the cloak turns and begins
heading across the sky, ~
MeneIaus: 	building after building passes beneath them as the move towards
the luscious outer ring of ~
MeneIaus: 	the island, home to the beaches and lush orchards that support it.
Short moments later the~
MeneIaus: 	cloak lands upon the beach and he stands and steps away in
thought::
Tana Scarletti: 	::shaken from the airborne flight - knees weak at the
prospect of the earth once more 
Tana Scarletti: 	beneath her.::<w>   Very interesting mode of flight m'lord.
::her voice catching in her 
Tana Scarletti: 	throat with these simple words::  What other illusions does
my lover possess? 
MeneIaus: 	Not illusions Dione, though I wish I had such powers, and I wish I
had seen them recently.
MeneIaus: 	::His back still to her and his hand running through the long dark
locks flowing from his~
MeneIaus: 	head::
Tana Scarletti: 	::a hand, placed gently upon his shouder.  there was a soft
clink of the metal bracelet that
Tana Scarletti: 	hung from her wrist.:: 
MeneIaus: 	Do I seem in discontent my fairest flower?  Saved from the ravages
of madmen so long ago?  ~
MeneIaus: 	Do I seem like my heart needs lifting?  Perhaps I do, your friend
seems to be playing well.
Tana Scarletti: 	He . . .  intrigues me.  ::a light step up behind him and
she presses herself up against his
Tana Scarletti: 	back.::  Does the game start so soon ?  Shall we jump upon
the board of mischeif once more 
Tana Scarletti: 	before even a proper welcoming to your home is given?
::sighs and lays her check against 
Tana Scarletti: 	his back.:: 
MeneIaus: 	The game started long ago Dione, you are just now entering the
board. ::turning he takes ~
MeneIaus: 	her face softly in his hand and peers into her eyes:: I had hoped
you to be an Ally to me, ~
MeneIaus: 	but if you choose to play against me, then that cannot be.  And
who cares about this ~
MeneIaus: 	Senator?  There is a reason his wife will not sleep with him, and
she had to turn to more ~
MeneIaus: 	viril alternatives.  Not to mention he makes a rather sad pawn
indeed.
Tana Scarletti: 	::ebony eyes narrow::  Viril alternatives?  Then it is true
- you have bedded her.  For most
Tana Scarletti: 	certainly you are just that; viril and alternative.  Two for
the price of one m'lord, surely
Tana Scarletti: 	your senechal must be please with your marketible talents. 
MeneIaus: 	What mindset has carried you to this delusion Dione?  I do not bed
women of married status,~
MeneIaus: 	not to mention... why would I spoil my royal blood with that of a
lowly Senators wife?
Tana Scarletti: 	Why indeed?  I have not yet been able to understand that
myself.  ::she pulls away from his 
Tana Scarletti: 	touch to move past him toward the breaking waves upong the
beach.:: 
MeneIaus: 	Because I haven't.. I would not soil myself to lay with her, I've
never even touched her.  ~
MeneIaus: 	I don't lower myself to play with my pawns, I have them done by
others.  She carries no ~
MeneIaus: 	child of mine, nor will she ever.  You would do well to never
accuse me of such things ever~
MeneIaus: 	again Dione.
Tana Scarletti: 	May the Gods forbid that you would spoil your royal blood.
::fire in her words fed by 
Tana Scarletti: 	the tightening in her chest - the wounded heart aching once
more from the sting of his 
Tana Scarletti: 	words::  Poisedion send your mermen - send your sirens ::her
voice carries out to the waters
Tana Scarletti: 	lapping at her feet::   A lowly senator's wife ?  You taunt
me  - knowing that even her 
Tana Scarletti: 	(one drop of her )  blood is purer than mine by tenfold.
::her movements bring her about to
Tana Scarletti: 	face him once more::  Tell me again how you won't bed
someone so far beneath your station 
Tana Scarletti: 	Menelaus. 
MeneIaus: 	That's not how I meant it Dione, I would not bed for the game.  I
would not spoil my seed ~
MeneIaus: 	unless it was through the desires of the heart.  Do you think I
would throw you away for a ~
MeneIaus: 	piece on a kings board?  Have I ever treated you like others would
treat you?  No.  I have ~
MeneIaus: 	always treated you with honor and dignity.  By all the Gods on
Olympus you should know ~
MeneIaus: 	better.  Perhaps I should have not returned to you, for I suspect
you find your Senator ~
MeneIaus: 	more pleasing.
Tana Scarletti: 	::dark lashes flutter. her eyes turned away from his
penetrating gaze.::  Speak no
Tana Scarletti: 	(not) such things.  No one means more to me than  you.
::the early morning breeze halos out
Tana Scarletti: 	the gauzy white cloth of her simple dress.::  <w>  Why do
you think I am so angry?  Because 
Tana Scarletti: 	once more you've bested me? ::shakes her head:: <vqw>  No .
. . because you're actions have 
Tana Scarletti: 	wounded me. 
MeneIaus: 	What actions?  Paying a man to sleep with his wife and then a
Soothsayer to proficy his ~
MeneIaus: 	downfall because of that affair?  I have told you once that I have
not touched her, not ~
MeneIaus: 	even my gaze has set upon her naked shoulders.  That should
suffice.
Tana Scarletti: 	Fine.  If you did not take her as your lover, then you
should have no concern for her life 
Tana Scarletti: 	nor that of her unborn child.  ::she tips her head back
definantly, her chin tiltled up in 
Tana Scarletti: 	the air:  I shall have Diomede continue through with his
orders then.  The Senate shall 
Tana Scarletti: 	certainly see fit to sacrifice the cheating whore.  
MeneIaus: 	I am sure that you would see it that way Dione.  For the Senator,
it matters not if she ~
MeneIaus: 	lives or dies.  I care as much for her life as I do for the sand
beneath my feet.  The ~
MeneIaus: 	Soothsayer spoke truth, he will fall if he kills her or lets her
live.
Tana Scarletti: 	The words of the Soothsayer can be bought as easily as a
harlot living within the rings of 
Tana Scarletti: 	the merchants district.  ::she waves her hand in dismisal::
Taunt me not with false 
Tana Scarletti: 	prophicy 
MeneIaus: 	Do you think that this plan has just been made by me Dione?  This
has been in the works for~
MeneIaus: 	nearly a year.  You cannot protect him, nor can you save him.  He
will fall, and in doing ~
MeneIaus: 	so you will learn a valuable lesson if you choose to become a true
player.  Never get ~
MeneIaus: 	attached to a pawn.  They are far too easily taken out, something
that you will soon see~
MeneIaus: 	for yourself.
Tana Scarletti: 	Attached?  ::her mocking laughter rings out in the early
morning, a flock of gulls disturbed
Tana Scarletti: 	from their morning meal feedings protest in anger and scurry
away::  Do you honestly think 
Tana Scarletti: 	that I am *attached* to the Senator?  -If- he were to die
upon the morrow the only tears 
Tana Scarletti: 	shed from mine eyes would be for theatrics only. 
MeneIaus: 	Then it won't matter when he dies by the time the sun is at its
highest peak today will you?
MeneIaus: 	When the guard finds him with the bloodied knife that stabbed his
wife through the heart in~
MeneIaus: 	his hands and gashes him from shoulder to hip for advancing on him
with a weapon.  Look me ~
MeneIaus: 	in the eyes and tell me that you will not care Dione. ::Her arm is
taken and her body spun ~
MeneIaus: 	to directly face him, his eyes bore into hers seeking the truth::
Tana Scarletti: 	Of course not.  ::spoken with confedience yet unable to look
into his eyes as she turns to 
Tana Scarletti: 	(turns her) face from his to look down at the grasp he has
upon her.  there is an 
Tana Scarletti: 	uncomfortible shift in her stance.:: 
MeneIaus: 	That's what I thought... ::He pushes her arm free of him and turns
stepping away and ~
MeneIaus: 	bending gracefully to scoop the cape from the sand without losing
step::
Tana Scarletti: 	Stop . . .  Menelaus. ::she watches his brisk retreat, a
growing seed of dread blossoming in
Tana Scarletti: 	her soul:: 
MeneIaus: 	::Doesn't turn to face her as he slows his pace:: So you could dig
the wound deeper?  Even ~
MeneIaus: 	if I was the one to bed that wench, I wouldn't fall for her... I
wouldn't betray my heart ~
MeneIaus: 	to share it with her... instead of keeping it whole in your hands.
Tana Scarletti: 	The heart that beats within my breast belongs only to you
m'lord.  Never . . . ::advances 
Tana Scarletti: 	upon him, stopping but a few scant feet away:: Ever forget
that.  If I could halt the 
Tana Scarletti: 	rising of the sun with but a motion  of my hand to prove
this I would. 
MeneIaus: 	But you share your heart with him, and he loves you does he not?
Are not your lips there ~
MeneIaus: 	but for his desire?  ::The words dig deep from their conversation
earlier this evening, the~
MeneIaus: 	quote nearly exact in wording::
Tana Scarletti: 	::her face blanches - curses against Aprhodite are thought::
Words Menelaus - merely words.
MeneIaus: 	Your own eyes betrayed you Dione, your own actions.  The look on
your face when he touched ~
MeneIaus: 	you... how you trembled as he spoke of his loss of honor for you.
Tana Scarletti: 	::her head shakes back - a liquid tumble of black curls
cascade down her back and 
Tana Scarletti: 	shoulders:: <w> You spied upon us . . . and you - you
believed the lies as easily as he. ~
Tana Scarletti: 	::the tip of her tongue wets her lips:: I am pleased that my
preformance was so convincing. 
MeneIaus: 	Don't try to cover it now Dione, you couldn't even look me in the
eyes.
Tana Scarletti: 	You laid your hands upon me - never before have you ever
laid your hands on me in any such 
Tana Scarletti: 	way. ::she pauses - her hand reaches out for him:: Look at
me - peer into the depth of my 
Tana Scarletti: 	eyes now and see that it is the truth that I speak.  
MeneIaus: 	Now that you have time to harden yourself and find your mettle.
Tana Scarletti: 	Shall I take the knife then - cut the death wound upon his
chest with my own hands to prove 
Tana Scarletti: 	it to you? 
MeneIaus: 	Would I suffer you to put yourself into mortal danger for my
hearts sake?  No.  
Tana Scarletti: 	So once more we fall to an impass m'lord.  ::she nods her
head and gentle reverance::  So I 
Tana Scarletti: 	must take your words to heart as the truth - and you must do
the same for me.
Tana Scarletti: 	( bleh  - that should be -in gentle reverence- ) 
MeneIaus: 	Must I?  And what now?  The Senator dies soon?  You still haven't
explained your ~
MeneIaus: 	involvement with him.
Tana Scarletti: 	Should I?  Do I demand that you release to me priviledge
information on your pawns.  ~
Tana Scarletti: 	I think not - only when I am about to be bested do you tell
me of your wiley schemes.  ~
Tana Scarletti: 	::pauses::  Do not think that just because the waters
carried you away from from my bed - 
Tana Scarletti: 	away from your house - that it makes you a stranger to me
Menelaus. 
MeneIaus: 	Those same waters carried me back apparently in time to prevent
that same bed from being ~
MeneIaus: 	shared by someone else.
Tana Scarletti: 	::no longer can she continue this arguement - as always
before to spar words with him in the
Tana Scarletti: 	heat of emotion was something she could not continue for any
length of time.  her shoulders 
Tana Scarletti: 	slump slighty - not in defeat by any means but rather to
quietly conceed to disagree without
Tana Scarletti: 	further insult. :: 
MeneIaus: 	::His hand lifts to cup her cheek again, lifting her face to him::
What am I to do with you?
Tana Scarletti: 	The same thing that you have always done with me.  ::she
refuses to allow even a tear drop 
Tana Scarletti: 	to form in her eyes:: 
MeneIaus: 	Carry you home and attend to your needs?
