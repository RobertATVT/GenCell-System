I am Dione.  <BR>
I am the spirited child of my fathers line.  <BR>
I am the unbridaled passion of my mothers loins.   <BR>
Welcome me. Worship me.  Forever be my Pawn. <BR>
I am Dione. <BR>

My birth occurred when the world was young and people believed in more than just one God.  My parents, may their souls rest in peace, were underprivileged, uneducated, and unwelcome in the homes of nobles unless there was manual labor to be performed.  <BR>
<BR>
My mortal death was dealt on the moon of the Spring Solstice in the year 1663 BC On the night of my Resurrection, I greeted the ebony sky with the knowledge that I, Dione of Thera, would walk amongst the pantheon of Immortals and thus, change the destiny of the tiny isle forever.<BR>
<BR>
My father of darkness, Creon; a man of Cimmerian eyes and fiery temper.  Delivered me into the hands of the night not by chance, but by devious plot.  A political observer in the courts of Thera, my Sire had need on occasion to take action in the behalf of his noble pawns.  A friendly game of mischief between myself and Menelaus had landed me right in the middle of one of Creon's insidious schemes.<BR>
<BR>
Ah, sweet oh so bitter sweet Menelaus.  My partner in crime. My adversary in mayhem.  Our friendship had been forged almost upon sight of one another.  Our relationship singed together for all eternity upon the night of my mortal death.<BR>
