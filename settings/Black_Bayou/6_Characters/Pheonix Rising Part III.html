"Ali. . . before I left, you came in with bruises and after heckling you for an hour or so I finally got you to admit where you got them.  You said something about a fight between you and Victor and whatever his wife's name is, something about a relationship?  When I got back to town and found you were gone I immediately thought of that.  And one night, I was a bit drunk and asked Victor if he had killed you.  Something about the way he looked, he just told me to hush but there was. . . Something . . . "<BR>

<B>June 3rd, 2000 - 11:05 p.m.<BR>
Moiriarti Hotel</B><BR>
<BR>
Alicia fell asleep sprawled across the king sized bed.  Dozens of envelopes lay neatly stacked in two piles; letters read and letters not.  Months of correspondence, hand written, sent overseas and kept by a woman Alicia did not remember ever knowing.  Some vague and some not so vague references to a life on Isle Voletta that Alicia did not remember ever living.  It had been clear to her when she fell into the fit of unrestful slumber, that life with Victor Martel hadn't been as rosy as he had painted the picture to be. <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT><B>6:66 a.m. - June 4th, 2000<BR>
Saint Michael's Catholic Church<BR>
</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Alicia stood outside the majestic chapel.  She gave no thought to the ringing bells that sang out in the early morning hour calling forth for the faithful to arise.  Nor did she think twice when the crowd around the front of the church parted as her graceful steps lead her from the hallowed archway and unto the cobbled sidewalk.<BR>
<BR>
Her eyes focused ahead of her, the penetrating gaze was unwavering yet filled with what some would call an inner wisdom.  One woman, dressed in a simple houserobe, graying hair tightly bound up in hot pink curlers, moved toward Alicia.  The woman's hand slowly raised up.  Alicia stopped, her ice blue gaze followed the liver spotted hand, the wrinkled fingertips reaching up, up over Alicia's shoulder.<BR>
<BR>
There was an audible gasp from the people.  A soft whispering rustle of feathery wings. The woman's withered hand fell upon an onyx black wing that sprouted from Alicia's back.  In a bright, blinding light, the inner skeleton of the woman glowed.  Before the vision on the onlookers, before the very gaze of Alicia herself, the aged woman  <BR>
simply vanished.  All that remained upon the spot on which she once stood was the singed and still smoking remains of a single hot pink curler.  The stench of burnt flesh and hair hung in the air, many of those who stood clustered around the Dark Angel gagged from the overpowering odor.<BR>
<BR>
Alicia continued on.  Her booted heel stomped down, crushing the curler beneath her step.  The Dark Angel's gaze once more focused forward.  There was an audible sound of leather and metal.  Chinks of black chain mail gashed against itself as she moved.  <BR>
<BR>
It made no difference to Alicia about the woman.  Everyone knew that to come in contact with the Damned was to suffer from the hand of Fates.  Death usually being the result of Muses whims.<BR>
<BR>
A dense fog began to swirl in a macabre dance.  The people, the buildings, the Dark Angel - everything was swallowed in a thick haze.  A ground shaking BOOM echoed from the bowels of the Earth herself.  It seemed as if the Father Sky above returned the bellow. The world as it was before, was no more.  <BR>
<BR>
The plague of white mist continued to swirl, a frantic attempt perhaps to right the insurmountable wrong that seems to build with each fleeting second that passed.  Yet, in the end, the last tendrils of fog receding as quickly as it had appeared.  All that was left was destruction.<BR>
<BR>
There was no life.  There were no people.  The clang of the church bell that had so fervently rung, was now silent.  Buildings for blocks around lay in rubbled heaps of twisted metal and stone.  <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT>. . . . And still the Dark Angel continued on.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
Seconds warped into minutes.  Minutes bled into hours.  Hours transformed into days.  The destruction that had been brought with the wrath of the mists lay in every direction.  Still - there was no signs life.  Only silence.  Only ruins of what once was called the Isle of Voletta, Island of Tears It was a world made perfect for Alicia.  In this reality, her Tainted touch would Damn no one.<BR>
<BR>
Weeks of searching.  Months of trudging through desolate landscape after desolate ruin.  Once more, she stepped down the same trodden path that she had walked over and over again.  But this time . . . this time there was something different.  Something magical about the way the wind blew across the leveled city.  Something . . .<BR>
<BR>
There before her, upon the horizon.  The lifeless darkness of the isle pierced by a shimmer of light.  The same booted steps carried her on, the pace unchanging.  The intensity of the Dark Angel's gaze lay before her.<BR>
<BR>
The white furred Horus hung lifelessly upon a monstrous pitch black cross.  It's fur matted and blood coated from the wounds of the Stigmata cut into it's massive form.  Soft whispers floated on the stale wind.  Death clung in the air like a palatable stench.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Confess . . . confess your Sins and be free of the Guilt.  <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>Confess . . . confess and be Redeemed as you once were.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT>Confess . . . . confess and all will be Forgiven. <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></I>The Dark Angel approached the Beast.  There was a soft rustle of her ebony wings.  An unnatural humming seemed to emanate from around the two beings.  The Horus's head rose, lifeless emerald eyes met with the icy gaze of the woman.<I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT></I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>"Are ye in pain?" Her voice was barely audible.<BR>
<BR>
"No."  As was his. <BR>
<BR>
Alicia knelt.  The chink of the black chain mail that caressed her body like silk brushed lightly against the rocky earth beneath her.  Seconds warped into minutes.  Minutes bled into hours.  Hours transformed into days. Weeks of searching.  Months of trudging through desolate landscape after desolate ruin.  And this -- this is what Her Reward was? He who was Justice?  He who was Pride before all others?  <BR>
<BR>
<I>Confess . . . confess your Sins and be free of the Guilt.  <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>Confess . . . confess and be Redeemed as you once were.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=RIGHT>Confess . . . . confess and all will be Forgiven. <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></I>She peered up.  The look of Temperance was hers.  His body, no longer the mythical beast of Legend.  No, now - Victor Martel hung limply upon the black wood of the Cross.   His naked physique covered with the Blood of those slaughted by his own hand.<BR>
<BR>
"Are ye in pain?" The question was posed again.<BR>
<BR>
"Yes."  And this time, the exertion of raising his gaze was too much of a burden for him to bare.  "Forgive me, Alicia . . . for I have Sinned. .  ."  <BR>
<BR>

Moiriarti Hotel</B><BR>
<BR>
The unforgiving buzz of the alarm clock pulled Alicia from her troublesome slumber.  The papers that had been so cautiously stacked hours before, now lay scattered to the four corners of the bed.  Oh, it had been clear to Alicia when she fell into the fit of unrestful sleep, that life with Victor Martel really *hadn't* been as rosy as he had painted the picture to be.  But now -- after her subconscious mind had unrelentingly placed each piece of her missing past together, it seemed as if their time togethere had been painted.  Painted and sculpted with the fresh Blood of Deception and Lies.<BR>
