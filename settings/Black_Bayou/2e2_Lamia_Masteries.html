</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Lamia masteries are what we call spells and incantations.  They represent the ability to focus one's will in such a way as to alter the world around them.  Spells come in a variety of forms.  They can be simple projections of the mind, repeated chants, intricate hand gestures, etc.  Regardless of the method, any Lamia must take physical action in order bring about the desired change.  In theory, the left side of the brain (creativity) is what brings about the change while the ritual, gestures, etc., fool the right side of the brain (logic) into believing the changes can be made.  Every mortal has the potential for manipulating the world with their will, but there are only a small few who can actually learn how.  Fewer still are the ones who learn to master them.<BR>

The role-played effects of certain masteries can last a lot longer than the combat effects.  Also listed here is the number of rounds it takes to activate the mastery.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time your character tries to use a mastery, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>
<BR>
A few of their powers require touch or eye contact in order for the Lamia to use their powers on the intended victim.  For touch masteries, the Lamia must touch them prior to the mastery having an effect (standard hand to hand roll, no damage; only if the victim refuses to be touched).  After they successfully touch the target, the system for the mastery is rolled.  The Lamia must also make eye contact for masteries requiring such.  If the victim fights the eye contact, the psychic must roll 2d6+Mind vs. victim's 2d6+Body prior to rolling the mastery's activation.<BR>

A loud popping sound is heard as contact is made.  If successful causes 1 damage to body.  If used with hand to hand attack: an extra 1 damage is added.  Also upon touching the victim, the Lamia causes intense pain, sickness, boils, seeping abscesses, etc., in the victim. For each round the target is held, the victim will suffer 1 Body damage. <BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between coven members, Lamia have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The Lamia can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance.  Each coven member must have the mastery Call The Coven to be included in the Mindspeak.  The coven must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.  The coven member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their coven name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the coven member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Coven members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B>Effect/description:  </B>Through the use of this spell, the Lamia can electrically charge an item to deliver a shock upon touch.  This spell causes the static electricity in the air around the item to spark when another object comes into contact with it.  This spark causes -1 Body damage to anyone who touches the item.  This can be cast on weapons, causing knives to do 2 damage for instance.  Due to their explosive natures, bullets and shells cannot be charged.  The item must be touched when the charging is cast.<BR>

<B>Effect Description: </B>The circle of protection is a literal circle, about 10 feet wide.  Cryptic sigils lace the inside rim of the chalk circle.  The Lamia sits in the middle, and performs a 5-minute chant.  At the conclusion of the chant, the Lamia is immune to all forms of mental masteries, including mindspeak.  Although the Lamia cannot be mentally touched, they can be physically touched.  This spell lasts as long as the Lamia remains within the circle's boundaries.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>The Lamia has learned to seek others out by manipulating their spell: Mindspeak.  This allows the Lamia to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the Lamia is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the Lamia must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> One of the Lamia's greatest abilities is the power over gravity itself, allowing the Lamia the gift of flight.  There are two separate spells intertwined in this singular one.  <BR>
<BR>
   Solo flight:  This costs 1 Soul and allows the Lamia to fly unaided.  The Lamia can never fly faster than 25 miles an hour and cannot carry anything over ten pounds. <BR>
<BR>
   Enchanted Flight: This costs 2 Soul and allows the Lamia to transfer the power of flight into an inanimate object - some of the most common being brooms and carpets.  The Lamia cannot empower any object weighing more than ten pounds.  The empowered object will fly where the Lamia wishes, though the Lamia doesn't have to be in direct contact with the object, they must remain concentrating on it.  Conversation is possible, but not even walking will be allowed.  This empowered object is capable of carrying passengers, depending on the size of the object - as passenger weight doesn't effect the magic, space does.  Common sense prevails here, but if you aren't sure ask the Room Host or ST on how many passengers can fit.  The object also doesn't need to be in sight, as the Lamia can 'see' from the object itself.  If the Lamia loses concentration the object will lose the gift of flight and will gently fall to the ground, much like a feather.  This has been built into the spell due to past Lamia's dying horrible deaths as their objects crashed to the earth.  The object will retain some aspects of magic if dropped into water (it will float) or even fire (has protection as long as the passengers don't leave the object) as there is a small 'bubble' of protection around the passengers.  However, passengers can still be effected by blows, shot, stabbed and even hit with arrows.  In both versions of the mastery, the protective sphere prohibits items from exiting the bubble (These include but are not limited to physical objects and the effects of masteries)  Think - things can go in, but things can't go out.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 28 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>This spell enables the Lamia to create a cloud of fog that surrounds the target.  The fog created is very thick, making combat nearly impossible.  The victim caught in the fog can barely see their hand in front of their face.  Attacks are made at random, meaning the victim cannot target any specific body location.  These attacks are wild, thus requiring a penalty of -4 to their Attack Modifier.  If the attacker in a fog misses their intended target, each person within range must roll to dodge the same attack in the order of who is closest (to be determined by the ST).<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> Throughout time, magicians have always been able to "create things out of thin air".  Most of these stage magicians rely on illusion to fool their audience.  True Lamia can sometimes pull matter from the spirit world, molding it into a physical object.  The object that is created must be rather small, no larger than a 2 liter bottle.  The Lamia must reach behind something the create the item.  I.E. reaching into a top hat to pull out a rabbit or reaching behind someone's ear to retrieve a quarter.  After the duration of the spell, the item will dematerialize instantly.  Chemical compositions, such as explosives, cannot be created with this spell.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 30 / 6 rounds or 3 minutes; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  On our Earth there are many dimensions of spirits that are just outside our realm of existence. The Lamia are one of the few who can actually harness the cosmic power of these spirits. Just as in life there are two major spheres of spirits.  Those who are for the light, and those who serve on the dark side.  By practicing their arts for lost ages, Lamia have learned the ability to call upon the powers of either the light or the dark.  Before the Lamia casts this mastery, they will notify the ST of which they are trying to invoke.  If the Lamia invokes a spirit from the light realm, they will receive +2 to their Will, +2 to their Inits, +2 to their Dodge and -4 to their Attack for the duration of the spell as the good spirit empowers the caster.  If the Lamia invokes a spirit from the dark realm, they will receive a +2 to their Attack, +2 to Inits, +2 to Dodge and a -4 to their will for the duration of the spell.  However, if the Lamia does not successfully call the spirit, the failed attempt will leave them stunned for two rounds.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to summon lightning from the storm clouds above to strike a specific victim.  A storm must be present in order for the Lamia to summon lightning.  A storm is usually identified by wind and rain, snow, hail, sleet or thunder and lightning.  A light shower or sprinkle does not constitute a storm.  A round of concentration is required to summon the lightning.  On the next round, the energies are harnessed and the Lamia has control over the lightning as a loud thunderclap is heard directly overhead.  During the third round, the Lamia may send forth the bolt from the heavens to the intended victim.  The damage for lightning bolt is -6 Body.  The target must be within line of sight to be targeted for a Lightning attack.  The intended victim is allowed to add their evasion skill to their defense roll if applicable.<BR>

The target is able to speak, as any toddler can - but they will make little sense.  Temper tantrums when they do not get their way, blatant disobedience when told to do something ... mischief making ... all the traits of "the Terrible Twos" will be exhibited.  Whatever memories the target had for those years will surface.  The target's mind will be only 2 for the duration.  <BR>

No one can hear anything that goes on within the radius, whether it be talking, yelling or gunshots, unless they pass through the invisible barrier.  Nor can those inside hear what transpires on the other side of the barrier, unless they pass through themselves.  The Shroud of Secrecy also effects Mindspeak.

<B>Effect/Description:</B> This is the truest measure of a Lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The Lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the Lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the Lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The Lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The Lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The Lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the Lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way, however.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs. victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The Lamia's magic is a physical manifestation of the collected force of the *mind*.  Stasis is air constriction.  A Lamia molds it with their mind.  This spell causes the air around a victim to compress itself tightly.  The duration of the mastery is 4 rounds.  The first round, the victim is completely immobilized, the compressed air holding them tightly.  For the following three rounds, the victim can barely move.  Their Attack and Quickness modifiers are -8 for the duration.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene + ; takes 1 round.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Even though a Lamia is essentially human, the forces of magick have given them powers beyond that of a mere mortal.  By tapping into their pure flow of magick, the Lamia will be able to increase all of their abilities.  When the Lamia taps into their internal magick source it causes changes to them physically; their eyes will shine an unnatural glow while the skin on their body will begin to wither and wrinkle from energy draining from their flesh to power their magick.  While this doesn't degrade them physically, it still can appear quite shocking.  Anyone with Lore Level 3 has an opportunity to recognize these changes in the Lamia (as per the Lore rules).  While under this mastery, the Lamia gains +2 Soul and +1 Mind for the duration.  If the Lamia spends an additional Soul point, they can keep this mastery tapped and change scenes without dropping it.  This Scene swapping can continue as long as the Lamia has Soul to spend.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 28 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can pinpoint some spot beneath the earth (within line of sight).  The Lamia can then focus their energy at the spot, forcing it to rise to the surface.  The rising of this energy spiritually rips through the earth causing it to shake violently.  Once this force reaches the surface, it dissipates.  This shaking causes people in the area to fall down, unless they succeed in a 2d6+Body+Athletics roll vs TN 28.  Things on shelves may fall down frightening children and animals.  No permanent damage to structures can be caused by this spell.</HTML>
