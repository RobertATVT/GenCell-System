</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>The dark powers of the vampire stem from the virus that both killed them and sustains their unlife.  These abilities reflect a vampire's dark, controlling nature as well as their agile and manipulative qualities.  To use a mastery, vampires merely have to concentrate to bend others to their will (unless otherwise noted in the individual mastery).  Few of their powers require touch or eye contact in order for the vampire to invade their victim.  For touch masteries, the vampire must touch them prior to the mastery having an effect (standard hand to hand roll, no damage; only if the victim refuses to be touched).  After they successfully touch the target, the system for the mastery is rolled.  The vampire must also make eye contact for masteries requiring such.  If the victim fights the eye contact, the vampire must roll 2d6+Mind vs. victim's 2d6+Body prior to rolling the mastery's activation.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
For most vampiric mastery use, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Since blending with their food base is a Vampires way of...life, they have the ability to shape change and not loose their clothing.  When a Vampire turns into their human shape again, they will be wearing their clothing.  Only clothing can be shapeshifted in this manner (as well as small personal effects such as keys, wallets and jewelry).  Weapons, tools and the like are not an intimate enough part of the vampire to change and will fall to the ground when the transformation is made.  Weapons disguised as jewelry will not transfer either, as it will interfere with the mystic properties of this Mastery: so no derringer belt buckles or knife shaped earrings capable of causing damage as examples.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I><BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between family members, vampires have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The vampire can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance.  Each family member must have the mastery Call The Family to be included in the Mindspeak.  The family must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.  The family member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their family name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the family member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Family members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B>Effect/Duration:</B>  The vampire is a confident creature in most situations, almost to the point of arrogance.  This confidence, when firmly believed in, can strengthen the will of the vampire, granting them a +4 to their Will for the rest of the scene.  This confidence is removed the moment the vampire fails any die roll for the remainder of the night, as its confidence is now shaken. This confidence is so powerful that the vampire may allow others to hit him and still not shake their ego. (Not roll to dodge)  Initiative does not count toward 'losing a die roll' for this mastery.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The vampire has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the vampire to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the vampire is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the vampire must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Effect/Description: </B> Gives the vampire the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The vampire may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The vampire may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The vampire may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed, unless they are thinking about their breed at the time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  During a shift into wolf form, a vampire may alter its molecular structure, assuming an oily mist form, slightly yellow in color.  It seems to float just above the ground, like a light fog.  While in this form, a vampire is immune to any physical damage except for that of the sun, fire or electricity (treat as fire).  If it takes  3 points of damage or more in one round, the shock will shift it back to its mortal form.  The vampire cannot make any physical attacks.  Mist can be trapped in an airtight container (the size of a large tea pitcher or larger) by a prepared victim.  The vampire may mindspeak in mist form, however, no other masteries may be used.  While in this form it may still be seen and smelled.  The mist vampire moves rather slowly and incurs a -4 penalty to quickness.  The vampire cannot feed in this form.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By making eye contact or touching the victim, the Vampire can stoke the fires of their soul, provoking an intense obsession within them.  Whether the obsession is a person, place, thing, emotion, etc., the victim will feel strongly compelled to do whatever they can to obtain the object of the obsession.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; this mastery takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the vampire posses a supernatural quickness which allows it to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the vampire, as the beast within them has turned to its instincts, not human reaction.  This mastery adds +3 to all defensive rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> The bond created by the ghouling of a mortal is so intense that whenever they wish, the vampire can impose their will upon the slave.  This causes the ghoul, regardless of their current location, to immediately seek out their undead master.  This summoning is very powerful and the ghoul will do anything to reach its beckoning master.  If the ghoul is unable to follow the summons after a half an hour their mind will slowly begin to deteriorate.  This effect manifests itself in many ways but usually takes the form of some kind of depressive insanity.  These effects are temporary, lasting until the ghoul sleeps.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs victim's 2d6+Body / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 turn to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/description: </B> Through a vampire's control over their own aging it can cause others, even vampires,  to unnaturally age simply by touch.  It focuses its mind on the victim's body, willing it to speed its aging process.  The victim will permanently age physically by two years.  Due to the shock the body endures by this process, the victim's modifiers to attack and quickness are lowered by 5 for the duration of the mastery.  This mastery may only be successful on the same victim once per night.  If one vampire uses it on them and another one tries anytime that night, they will be unsuccessful (regardless of the roll - even double 6's) and will still lose 1 soul for their effort.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Over time, the vampire can learn to expand and direct the nature of its inner beast during times of stress.  This monstrous energy can then be directed toward the vampire's physical form, causing the beast form of a vampire to emerge.  In vamporos form the vampire's body expands beyond the bounds of its human shape.  The vampire becomes massive, standing nearly eight feet tall.  Its body is skeletal, any clothes the vampire wore would be ripped and hanging loosely from its body.  The face elongates sharply from forehead to chin and cheek to cheek.  The vampire's eyes shrink to mere slits, the pupils glowing an eerie red.  Wicked gleaming fangs hang below the bottom lip and the nails harden into sharp claws.  The vampire's mind explodes with anger and passion, almost completely overriding rational thought.  It can formulate simple thoughts and speak crude, guttural English (or other language depending on its homeland).  Vampires can feed normally in this form.  While in this form, the vampire gains +2 Body. <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</HTML>
