</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Darkness comes in many shapes and sizes, and the charming man smiling gently at you from the corner of the room may be preparing to rend your soul apart.  Corrupting forces of pure darkness are what makes a Demon tick.  Due to a link with the eternal dark, Mortals that have bound themselves to Demons are granted powers of manipulation and death in order to become a soldier in the eternal struggle of darkness and light.  Rarely do Demon's go out of their way to directly cause death and destruction, they'd much rather prefer to twist and corrupt the soul of their intended victim.  Deviousness is the watchword for these agents of the dark, for to cause a dark act while the common man perceives it to be good is how the Demon chalks up souls for the afterlife.  The prize of their efforts are the souls they gain and in their eternal battle with light, the side with the most souls at the end...wins. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  the roll required to activate the mastery and the target number needed for the character to succeed / how long the effects of the masteries last.  The role-played effects of certain masteries can last a lot longer than the combat effects.  Also listed here is the number of rounds it takes to activate the mastery.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
For most demonic mastery use, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>
<BR>
A few of their powers require touch or eye contact in order for the demon to use their powers on a victim.  For touch masteries, the demon must touch them prior to the mastery having an effect (standard hand to hand roll, no damage; only if the victim refuses to be touched).  After they successfully touch the target, the system for the mastery is rolled.  The demon must also make eye contact for masteries requiring such.  If the victim fights the eye contact, the demon must roll 2d6+Mind vs. victim's 2d6+Body prior to rolling the mastery's activation.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between the  horde, demons have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The demon can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its demon horde as one, regardless of distance.  Each demon must have the mastery Call The Horde to be included in the Mindspeak.  The horde must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The horde member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their horde name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the horde member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Horde members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon may take temporary possession of another's body with simple eye contact.  The real person's personality becomes submerged in their subconscious mind.  The demon has full control over the body of the victim.  The host body the demon currently inhabits will be unable to move, think, feel, anything while the demon is controlling the victim.  If the intended victim wins the roll, it is safe from further Control attempts for the rest of the night.  No victim of this mastery may be commanded to cause damage to themselves (jumping in front of a car, shoot themselves, etc.) nor can the demon use the affected target's masteries.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When someone begins to show guilt or the potential guilt for committing some act, the demon is capable of suppressing that guilt, enabling the victim to perform the actions without concern for guilt or conscience.  This works on with any one action the victim is performing.  After the act, the victim will be overcome with more intense guilt than they ever realized was possible (should be role-played in the room and posted).<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  To compliment a demon's abilities in falsehood, they can sometimes assume the form of someone they know.  The real person appearing before viewers dispels the illusion for those spectators only.  Later on, if the demon under this guise is seen by another "victim", they are easily deceived.  The demon will look, smell, sound and feel like the assumed form.  Combined with Soul Mask the demon could be virtually undetectable unless the real person shows up.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / see below; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This is the ability to manipulate the dreams of a victim while they are sleeping. The victim will be unaware that they are dreaming and will take the events as fact, until they wake up.  If a dream becomes too horrific (Storyteller discretion), then the victim is allowed a one time roll of 2d6+Mind vs. a target number of 16 to wake up.  Otherwise, the victim will continue to sleep until the dream has ended.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Level 1 ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The demon is able to control the type of dream a victim is having.  The events of the dream are random, i.e., a happy dream, a sad dream, a nightmare, etc.  This dream can be a maximum of 15 minutes long.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Level 2 ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The demon is able to not only control the mood of the dream, but is able to actually manipulate randomly created events.  It cannot create events, only manipulate existing ones.  This dream can be a maximum of 30 minutes long.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Level 3 ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> At this level of ability, the demon is able to create the setting of the dream and the events that will transpire.  This dream can be a maximum of 45 minutes long.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Level 4 ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The demon is not only able to control the events of the dream, but it is also able to incorporate itself in the dream, as if it were one of the inhabitants.  The demon is able to assume ANY guise.  This dream can last a maximum of 1 hour.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Level 5 ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  With this level of ability, the demon has total control of every facet of the dream, except for the victim's actions.  Its control is so absolute, that it can actually cause physical damage to the victim.  Damage done from attacks in the dream are done to the mind at 2 damage points.  If the victim dies in its dream, it *does not* die in the characters real life.  If a victim falls unconscious, they are no longer effected by the dream.  Once the duration of the mastery is over, the victim's mind heals overnight.  This dream can last a maximum of 1 and a half-hours.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The demon has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the demon to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the demon is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the demon must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs 2d6+Will / 4 rounds (combat) or Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>In visual sight of the victim, the demon may cause their hidden desires to manifest to the point that they act upon them.  The priest with a long-hidden penchant for fish net might find himself unable to resist wearing it to 'mass'.  The recovered alcoholic may suddenly fall off the wagon, drinking himself into a stupor.  The victim's Will modifier is at -2 for the duration.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Each level purchased grants the demon the ability to create an illusion with an additional sense.  Level 1 is sound, 2 is sight, 3 is smell, 4 is taste, 5 is touch.  A demon can make use of any of the senses he has for a single illusion, i.e., a demon with level 2 could make a fire that could be heard and seen, while one with level three could make a fire that could be heard and seen, as well as smell the wood burning.  At level 5, actual attacks can be made.  This is done using the demon's stats and skills, though a Will roll is still made to see if the illusion is created in the first place and believed.  Damage for the skill used is halved,  (rounded down) and done to the mind, though the target will see their own blood etc.  Unless dispelled by the demon, mindspeak wont break through to someone being effected by an Illusion, however, Hypnotic Suggestion would cancel out the effects.  A round of concentration is required to form the Illusion.  On the next round, the demon sends the Illusion out to be heard, seen, smelled, tasted, or touched.  Many Illusions can be created with this mastery, however, a new roll and another Soul point spent would be in order.    *Note:  If the Illusions effect individuals, then they totally believe in it.  Meaning the Illusions has the ability to affect them physically. For instance, if a demon creates a deafening, high pitched sound, it would hamper or possibly damage the hearing of its victim.  If the demon created a bright flash of light, the victim may be temporarily blinded.  Once the Illusion is over, the victim regains their Mind points, as the effect is over.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> A demon is not able to simply rip the fabric of time.  However, it can twist it and shape it, thus creating illusions.  This is a simple mastery that must first be learned before the demon is able to totally change its host's appearance.  Mask is the ability to change the host's facial features.  It is impossible to mask the face of a living person as their life force strongly disrupts such a minor illusion.  It is possible to make a living person believe they see something they do not when looking at another though.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B> Gives the demon the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The demon may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The demon may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The demon may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> The demon can tap into it's infernal powers to delve deep into the soul of a victim in order to learn their deepest, darkest sins.  The better to tempt them with, my dear. This gives the demon the ability to understand thoughts and even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The demon may IM the victim and ask 3 questions regarding their deepest, darkest sins.  The victim's player must answer these questions as truthfully as the character remembers.  The victim will have no clue, in-character, that the demon has been peering into their soul.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is the ability to hide a demon breed from those with the ability to Scrye such things.

<B>Effect/Description: </B>By making eye contact, the demon can exert its demonic will over a victim, paralyzing it with fear.  If successful, the victim will be at -4 to Attack and Quickness for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in when the duration expires.    <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon can sometimes alter the way a victim sees things.  These are small, minor  effects that last a very short time and are intended to frighten a victim.  For instance, making it appear their skin is wrinkled with severe age or momentarily create a UFO only visible to that one person.  Upon success, the distraction causes a -4 to Attack, Will and Quickness modifiers (in combat) to the victim.</HTML>
