You may have prayed during you life at one time or another, and it is a common joke that there is no such thing as an atheist in a bunker.  Perhaps you believe a prayer has even been answered.  But there are those that have a direct connection with the eternal powers of light.  Masteries for Angels are gifts from the spiritual realm of light.  While the Angel is in good standing and continues to follow the path of righteousness, amazing powers will be filtered through them to better and change the physical plane of man.  Woe to the Angel that begins to fall to the material wants of man, but blessed is the Angel that sacrifices all for the continual war of light versus darkness.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  the roll required to activate the mastery and the target number needed for the character to succeed / how long the effects of the masteries last.  The role-played effects of certain masteries can last a lot longer than the combat effects.  Also listed here is the number of rounds it takes to activate the mastery.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
For most angelic mastery use, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>
<BR>
A few of their powers require touch or eye contact in order for the angel to use their powers on another player.  For touch masteries, the angel must touch them prior to the mastery having an effect (standard hand to hand roll, no damage; only if the victim refuses to be touched).  After they successfully touch the target, the system for the mastery is rolled.  The angel must also make eye contact for masteries requiring such.  If the victim fights the eye contact, the angel must roll 2d6+Mind vs. victim's 2d6+Body prior to rolling the mastery's activation.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can fill any character with a brief and overwhelming sense of compassion and amity.  If timed correctly, the person may follow through on some action they would not have done otherwise, i.e., giving to charity, befriending a lost soul, lending advice.  Using this gift to derive personal benefit is considered a grave sin.  This mastery can force another character out of their True forms (i.e., Horus, TVF, TAF, etc.).  If successful target is filled with compassion, -3 to Attack for duration.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> As there exists an incredible bond between the servants of God, angels have learned to fine-tune Mindspeak during times of war.  The angel can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to its flock, regardless of distance.  Each flock member must have the mastery Call The Flock to be included in the Mindspeak.  The flock must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The family member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their family name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the flock member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Flock members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  When subjected to, and unable to avoid confrontation, the angel will draw on its inner strength to combat any bodily harm it sustains.  A pale aura of gold will surround the angel, visible only to those with the Faith skill.  The angel is more resilient to the damage they can take before the pain begins to affect their abilities.  Celestial Armor absorbs 3 points of damage per round, then any other damage taken during the rest of the round will make it through the armor.  The armor will recharge at the beginning of each round for its duration.  This mastery may only be used once per night. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. 20 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel is not always the impartial observer.  Occasionally, the evil they face is so great, the angel must reach deep within itself to pull forth the forces of aggression.  A physical representation of the angel's aggressive nature comes forth, seemingly from out of nowhere.  This aggression takes the form of some sort of hand held weapon (not a ranged weapon).  This weapon (selected at character creation) will appear in the angel's hand and will have a softly glowing silver aura emanating from it that anyone within line of sight can see.  The weapon causes 3 Body damage with each successful attack roll of 2d6+Attack+Large Melee (if applicable), but cannot be used to kill.  This damage will only incapacitate a victim.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The angel has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the angel to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the angel is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the angel must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

<B>System-Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN see below / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Sometimes, an emotional bond can be a destructive thing. Addictions to smoking, an intense love for some odd hobby, and even the bonds of love can become dangerous issues when the smoker is pregnant, the hobby is pedophilia, and the bonds of love are preventing a battered wife from leaving her husband. This mastery will not immediately severe the ties a person has to another person or thing, but when that person is ready to "face their addiction," Freedom will allow them to overcome the withdrawal symptoms which urge them to return.  Yes, this mastery can be used to overcome the ties between a ghoul and his master; the difficulty in that case is 24.  The target numbers are: 18 for mild addictions; 20 for moderate addictions; 24 for serious addictions.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the angel possesses a natural quickness that allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the angel, as the holy energies within them have enhanced their reactions.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e., Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  An angel can sometimes alter the way a victim sees things.  These are small, minor  effects that last a very short time and are intended to calm and comfort a victim.  For instance, making it appear that they are in a heavenly place, or that they are surrounded by loved ones.  The angel will manifest these visions based on what the victim secretly desires to see.  Upon success, the happiness brought on by the vision causes a+2 to any roll involving their Will modifier for the rest of the night.<BR>

<B>System/Effect: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> A divination of sorts that harnesses the Light's power to seek out the souls that the angel is sworn to protect.  This mastery would distinguish if a being were a mortal, but not what breed, if any, should the person be discovered to be more than mortal.  Mortal breeds such as Lamia, Psychic, and Ghoul would show to be Mortal, and nothing more.  If the victim is other than a mortal breed (as specified in the previous sentence), the angel will only know they are not mortal, unless they have Level 3 Lore of the victim's breed.  In that case, they will know the breed as well.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This mastery gives the angel the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The angel may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The angel may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The angel may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN see below / see below; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can become the epitome of what it was meant to be:  the impartial observer, making unknown subtle changes for good.  The angel becomes invisible to all sight, including infrared and all sound, though not imperceptible with touch or scent.  As an option, the angel may be visible to one other person, but no more than one.  TN is 22 to turn invisible to all and 24 to be visible to only one person.  Should the angel exceed a target number of 28, they will be able to touch and otherwise communicate normally with the selected target.  The mastery remains in effect until the angel is either touched, attacks or otherwise comes into contact with someone else physically. <BR>

Target number 20 grants the ability to detect the truth from the same individual for 1 hour.  TN 24 grants the ability to detect the truth from the same individual for the entire night.  TN 28 grants the ability to detect the truth from all others in sight/vicinity for the night.</HTML>
