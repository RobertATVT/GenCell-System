(revised 5-23-99)</B></I><BR>

<B>Mission Statement</B><BR>
   Black Bayou is an on-line, interactive role playing game.  Our goal as members of the Black Bayou staff is to continue the further enjoyment of the players in this game to the best of our capabilities.  It is our responsibility as staff members to enhance the game play of Black Bayou; to do this it is required that all staff members maintain a helpful and professional attitude <I>at <B>all </B>times</I>.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Duties of a Host</B><BR>
   The most important duty of a room host is to ensure that all the players of Black Bayou are having fun in their role-play.  To do this, it is imperative that we maintain the room in an orderly fashion.  This includes, but is not limited to, helping new potential players learn how the game works, answering any game related questions, ensuring that the players remain in character within the room and gently dissuading any room disruption.  However, the priority of watching the room exceeds all others.  This includes Instant Messages.  If you are unable to keep up with the action in the room, you are to ignore any Instant Messages (especially personal ones).<BR>
<BR>
   To ensure that the room runs as designed; it is also the responsibility of a room host to be ready and available for their shift at least five (5) minutes prior to the scheduled time.  This will ensure a smooth transition within the room during the changing of hosts.  During this time the host being relieved will instruct the new host of any game or TOS related activities such as players waiting for an available ST or a room disrupter that continues to enter the room.<BR>
<BR>
   It is the duty of the scheduled back-up host (when they are available) is to ensure that the scheduled host is ready and available for the shift.  If the scheduled host is not available, it is the responsibility of the back up host to cover the room for the duration of the shift.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Missed Hosting Shifts</B><BR>
   If a room host is unable to work their scheduled shift, a twenty-four (24) hour advance notice sent via email to BBST Isil, BBST Martel and BBSTMail is required.  If a notice is not received, the room host will be marked as a no show for the shift and will be written up unless the host has secured a replacement in advance.  It is the responsibility of the scheduled back-up host (if one is available) to cover the room in the event of a no show and to provide notice of the shift coverage to BBST Isil, BBST Martel and BBSTMail.<BR>
<BR>
   When a proper notice is provided requesting coverage for a shift, it is the responsibility of the Assistant Personnel Director to secure a replacement.  Should the replacement host not be available to cover the shift after agreeing to do so via email, the written warning would be issued to the replacement host.<BR>
<BR>
   If a 24-hour advance warning is provided by a Host who is unable to cover an assigned shift, then it becomes the duty of the Assistant Personnel Director to cover the shift.  No more than two missed shifts per 30 consecutive days are allowed.  Hosts who cannot cover their assigned shifts are no longer needed as Hosts.<BR>
<BR>
  If a Host fails to sign on for a scheduled shift and there is no backup host scheduled, it becomes the responsibility of every Host online to ensure the room is covered.<BR>
<BR>
   If a host requests vacation time or a leave of absence from hosting for a period of time the request must be sent to BBSTGrowl, BBST Isil, BBSTMartel, and BBSTMail a minimum of one (1) week in advance.  All such requests will be considered on a first come-first serve basis.  A leave of absence may or may not be accepted instead of a resignation from the hosting staff of Black Bayou.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rewards for Hosting</B><BR>
     A Host will receive 1 XP for each hour of an assigned shift that the Host covers.  If a Host covers less or more than an hour, it is up to the Personnel Director to assign the appropriate XP for the time covered.  A Host will receive 1 extra XP for a shift covered that was not their scheduled shift, exception being if shifts are traded.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rules of Hosting</B><BR>
