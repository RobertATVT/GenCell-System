Whether through evolution, intense training or other means, some mortals have learned to reach deep within their own minds to bring about a change or observe glimpses of things yet to happen.  This is a limited control over their subconscious mind on a conscious level.  Although all humans possess the ability to manipulate their surroundings using the power of the mind alone, not all humans are actually able to tap into this raw energy.  Those that do, however, wield "unearthly" abilities.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> A psychic will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e. a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  Wounds created by either fire or salt water take twice as long to heal than normal.<BR>

Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue. You believe psychics can read minds and alter the thoughts of others.  They can move things and set fires with but a glance.  Some may even be able to cause your head to explode by focusing their thoughts on yours.  On the other hand, some psychics are able to read the future through a number of different mediums.  Psychics are all around you and most of them don't even know it yet.  But that's okay.  If you ever need one, they are just a 1-900 phone call away.<BR>

Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false. You've learned that psychics can die just like anyone else.  You've also learned that their abilities are more subtle than you thought at first.  Most of the time, their victims don't even know what they're up to.  When a psychic uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the psychic use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Power Crystal:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Power crystals are little more than a piece rose quartz crystal at least 1 inch long and a half inch in diameter.  These crystals are powerless until an individual channels their faith through it.  The power of faith tends to emanate and encircle the wearer, protecting them from physical contact or psychic intrusion by a practitioner of the mind.  This power extends to a 10' radius.  Once the crystal is empowered, the wearer cannot move outside of the radius or the effects are immediately canceled.  To empower a crystal, the individual must be able to touch it, physically.  They spend a round of concentration, focusing their faith on the crystal.  After the round of concentration, the player must roll 2d6+Soul+Faith vs a TN 22.  If they succeed, the empowerment of the crystal is successful and will last for an entire scene, or until they leave the 10' radius.  If the psychic is wearing a crystal, it may also be empowered by a believer.  The individual must touch the crystal as normal.  In this case, however, the player's roll would be 2d6+Soul+Faith vs the psychic's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If this roll is successful, the same radius will be created around the psychic.  The psychic will be unable to remove or otherwise affect the crystal in any way, until the end of the scene.  Additionally, they will not be able to leave or use masteries (including mindspeak) outside the radius of the empowered crystal.<BR>

You've learned all that is truth about these "gifted" individuals.  When a psychic uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Psychic by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Psychic, which happens to be Psychical.  If you wish to identify the Psychical as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Psychic, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Psychic transform either to or from Psychical.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Psychic.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Crystal Water: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Crystal water is little more than water mixed with a finely crushed rose quartz crystal and black rose petals.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough crystal water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the psychic with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of crystal water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the psychic are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the psychic suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The psychic must heal the damage as any normal mortal would, except at twice the normal rate.  That would mean each point of damage would take 6 days to heal rather than 3.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the psychic heal faster at the maximum rate of normal healing speed.  Crystal water wounds cause disfiguring scars that will eventually heal after a months time.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>
