When creating a new werewolf pack, there are a few things that should be considered.  Isle Voletta is a good sized island, but the city of Voletta is not that large.  Werewolves rely on the size of the land to spread out, creating their own patches of territory.  Therefore the size of the island determines how many werewolf packs there can be before overpopulation puts serious demands on the feeding stock as well as put them in greater danger of having their breed discovered.  Voletta is large enough for five werewolf packs with no more than 13 members per pack.  If a pack tries to make a 14th member, that wolf will be rogue - as the blood has thinned too much from the Alpha.  <BR>
<BR>
If there is enough room for a new pack, the Alpha-to-be must have created four pups of their own.  This soon to be Alpha must also must be playing an approved werewolf character sheet for at least 6 months and have Lore level 3 in Werewolf.  In order to maintain their Alpha status, they must roleplay for a minimum of 5 days in a character sheet update period.   An Alpha's power comes mostly from the combined energies of its pups.  The more werewolves they surround themselves with that share the same viral genes, the more power the Alpha has.  Like the age old adage the closer to the bone the sweeter the meat, the same applies to the Alphas.  His own pups are his power, but Lo to the Alpha who allows his pups to build their own packs, for herein lies their greatest peril.  As the strength of his pups serve to make the Alpha what he is, he cannot permit his pups to build their own power base.<BR>
<BR>
When an Alpha's pup creates their own, the Alpha still benefits, but to a lesser extent.  The pup acts as a blood "clot" between the Alpha and the grandpup.  The pup, of course, benefits the most from them.  Grandpups also count toward this pack member total, though the amount of power they return to the Alpha is significantly less than the pup.  The pup acts as a barrier, blocking a direct flow of power to the Alpha, keeping most of it for themselves.  <BR>
<BR>
When a pup creates 5 or more pups of their own, they become a threat to the Alpha.  At that point, the pup has accumulated enough "lunar power" to break free of the genetic viral ties of their Alpha.  If there are less than 5 packs total, the pup that broke free may apply for Alpha status.  If not, they simply lead a band of rogue werewolves.  Of course, the Alphas who would sit by and let this happen are few and far between.  It is the rogue werewolves that are the greatest threat to any society.<BR>
<BR>
Either way, to create the pack, the player of the Alpha must submit a Breed Leader Request to</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BBSTMail. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Once approved, the Alpha will have access to the Alpha mastery list and have their own page set up in the main boards.

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Rogue Werewolves</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Werewolves who do no belong to any established pack are considered Rogues.  They are often found in cities or rural areas where the werewolf population exceeds the capacity for each pack to have its own territory.  They generally cause a strain on the werewolf packs and are most often hunted down and killed due to the threat and disrespect they present.  Rogue werewolves present other problems as well.<BR>
<BR>
Rogue werewolves who lead groups do not gain the same benefits as the traditional Alphas of werewolf packs do.  They also lack the social prestige of leading a pack.  These two factors are usually enough to inspire even the youngest of rogues to vie for power.  This means one of the established werewolf packs have to be removed to make room for themselves.  Obviously, this tends to lead from political maneuvering, manipulation, the occasional terroristic attacks and so on.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>When Pups Die</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
If a pup dies while they still belong to the Alpha's pack, all of their grandpups automatically become the pup of the Alpha, or the next highest werewolf on the genetic virus chain.  For instance:<BR>
<BR>
Alpha<BR>
   Pup 1<BR>
   Pup 2<BR>
       GPup 1<BR>
       GPup 2<BR>
          GGPup 1<BR>
   Pup 3<BR>
<BR>
If GPup 2 were to die, their pup, "GGPup 1" would become the pup of Pup 2 because that is the next parent on the genetic virus chain on the way to the Alpha.  If Pup 2 were dead or was to die, then GGPup 1 would become the pup of Alpha, as would GPup 1.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>With practice comes mastery.  An Alpha who has trained and strengthened their will long enough may eventually learn to control the beast within while allowing it to surface.  With this mastery, the Alpha is able to control itself completely while in Horus form.  While they are able to think rationally, use masteries and take other actions they were previously unable to, they lose the resistance to the masteries they were once immune to in this brutal form.  They are even capable of speech, although their voices will be rough and guttural.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

System/Duration: </B>2d6+Mind vs TN 16 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description:</B><I> </I>Werewolves that band together forming a pack are a formidable force indeed.  When they are guided by an Alpha with great cunning and intelligence they become a nearly unstoppable force.  Through a combination of pack tactics and strategy a skillful Alpha can lead its pack through the gates of hell and make it back unscathed.  By spending a round assessing the combat situation and barking orders, the Alpha can increase its pack's chances of succeeding in their actions during the next four rounds.  For each point the Alpha scores over 16, each member of its pack receives +1 to each and every combat die roll they make during the mastery's duration (skills that appear in the Combat Skill list).  This includes attacking and evading.  However, even the greatest leaders can make mistakes on occasion.  Should the Alpha fail the roll, each member of its pack will suffer a -1 penalty for each point under 16 the Alpha scored for the next four rounds.  In order for the pack members to benefit from this mastery, they must be able to both see and hear the Alpha.  The orders must be given orally, eliminating the use of Mindspeak in any form.  The Alpha may use this mastery in Horus form only after a successful use of Horus Mastery.  This mastery my only be used once per scene. <BR>

Effect/Description: </B>Even the wisest and most peaceful of beings understands that use of force is sometimes a necessary thing.  The "next step" in self discipline, the ability to summon forth the beast during even the most relaxed situations.  By way of this mastery, the Horus form can be called forth whenever the Alpha desires.  When they willingly bring their beast to the surface, they are treated the exact same as any other Horus except for a limited intelligence that remains.  While they are unable to communicate or use mental masteries, they are capable of discerning who is an enemy and who is not, combine their attacks to those they choose.  As stated above, it takes 1 round to summon forth the beast within.  It takes and additional round to actually shape change to the Horus form.  No target is required when the Horus is brought about in this manner.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

System/Duration: </B>2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>Although rare, it is not unheard of for a werewolf to get out of line within the pack.  Most Alphas have realized the death of their fellows serves absolutely no purpose.  Therefore, some Alphas have learned alternate ways to handle to disobedient.  During a total eclipse of the moon, all werewolves temporarily "loose the wolf".  Meaning, they lose all of their masteries, shape changing abilities and for all intents and purposes, become mortal until the light of the moon once again graces the sky.  An Alpha who has studied this phenomena can attempt to duplicate it's affects upon a single individual by sheer force of will.  Should the Alpha beat the victim in the test of wills mentioned above, the victim will effectively loose the use of all their masteries for the rest of the scene.  This includes everything from shape changing to Mindspeak.  If the victim is in wolf or Horus form, they will immediately revert back to their mortal form.  The use of this mastery is often considered a great insult by many werewolves and if used without good reason, could result in an overthrow of the Alpha. <BR>
