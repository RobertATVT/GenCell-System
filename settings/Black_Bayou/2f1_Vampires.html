A vampire is a creature that stems from myths and legends from countless societies.  Vampires are mortals who have died and then returned from the grave.  Only on the surface do they appear even remotely human.  In general, they look exactly as they did when they were mortal, save for their unnaturally pale skin.  The vampiric curse locks the individual into the exact same physical appearance they had when they died.  Within the span of a few minutes, any attempted alterations will return to the way they were, prior to the change.  For instance, their hair may not be cut, dyed or altered in any way (aside from style).  This includes any kind of physical change; including tattoos, piercing, etc.<BR>
<BR>
On the inside, a vampire is much different from their mortal counterparts.  First of all, their internal organs and the rest of their insides have begun to decay and wither.  This means they have no functional stomach with which to digest food, no workable lungs with which to breathe air and a totally inactive reproduction system incapable of bearing offspring.  This is not to say a vampire cannot pretend to eat, breathe, or experience a sexual encounter.  In fact, they are known for their great powers of seduction.  They simply cannot produce actual children as vampires of either sex are sterile.  In fact, the only functioning internal organs a vampire still possesses is its heart and its brain.  The central nervous system is intact since that is what control body movement as the brain sends its signals, as well as the muscles that cause the movements.  <BR>
<BR>
As a side note: Vampires <B><I>do</B></I> have a pulse.  Yes, their physical bodies are dead, but their hearts are intact and the circulation of blood is necessary to keep the muscles working.  This also means that a vampire that drinks large quantities of alcohol will eventually get drunk, as the liquor circulates through their system, eventually affecting their brain.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming:<I>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>Creating a vampire is not an easy process.  One must first learn to control their own great hunger before creating another.  The vampire must first bite the mortal, draining the body of nearly all of its blood.  This brings the mortal to the brink of death.  At this point, the vampire must overcome the Blood Rush that effects all vampires when they feed.  The Blood Rush is the vampire's reaction, those ecstatic feelings that overcome them when they feed on the intoxicating substance of blood. They must roll 2d6+Will vs a TN of 20.  Vampires no longer roll this after 4 months of their own breed generation.  If the Vampire is 4 months or older AND has a Will stat of 20 or more, they can create a Vampire without an ST or GM being present.  This siring must be posted in the STs lair and the CSs verified before the incident is considered official.  If the intended target resists the siring, none of the above applies as an ST or GM must be there.  If the Vampire is NOT 4 months old and/or has a Will less than 20, this roll must be witnessed by either a GM or ST.  If the vampire fails this roll, they are consumed by the ecstasy of the experience, unintentionally draining the mortal completely, killing it.  If they successfully resist the Blood Rush, they are able to stop themselves, and prevent the death of the vessel.  If the mortal survives, the vampire then feeds them its own blood, nearly draining the vampire completely as they fill the victim with vampiric blood.  This transfer of blood may be attempted a variety of ways.  It may be orally fed to the mortal, injected, poured into an open wound, etc.  The scientific principal behind it is the vampire removes the clean blood from the victim, replacing most of it with it's own vampiric infected blood.  The infected blood enters the system of the mortal, thus causing the physical and supernatural changes.<BR>
<BR>
The victim will, over the next three days, die a slow mortal death.  This should be role-played and posted.  It would start slowly, the mortal growing more and more sick by the day, until the third day when the mortal would finally collapse, unconscious.  Then, over the next day and into that evening, the victim would rise as a newly created vampire.  Great care must be taken by the siring vampire to ensure its new progeny doesn't collapse out in the woods or in another place accessible by the sun.  On the fourth day, when the body is dead and rises as a vampire, the sunlight will severely injure the new vampire if precautions aren't taken.  In some cases, the victim will not know what is happening to them as their body slowly dies, making for an interesting role-playing experience.  On the fourth night after the blood rush success, the victim will rise as a vampire, complete with vampiric abilities.<BR>

They tend to experience delusions of grandeur, believing themselves to be invincible (see appendix: Ghouls).  These severely addictive effects are temporary, only lasting about a week.  The power of this addictive substance requires that there be a third party to force the mortal off of the vampire if they are being fed directly, should the vampire not be strong enough to push them away themselves (2d6+Body+Athletics vs. 2d6+Body+Athletics).  If the mortal is not restrained, they will end up drinking the vampire dry causing the vampire's Mind statistic to drop to 0.<B><I><BR>

When a vampire consumes the blood of another, a special kind of bond is created.  The ingesting vampire will develop an extreme emotional tie toward the donor.  They will do everything they can to aid the other vampire in whatever they do, regardless of how they normally feel about them.  This bond only lasts for a week, but the enslaved vampire can easily be made to drink more before the week is up.  A vampire will always remember the reason they feel these intense emotions.  This form of bondage is considered a grave insult among all vampires.  Only three vampires may be bound to one at any time.  If another vampire attempts this on a vampire currently under another's bond, the attempt will automatically fail.<BR>

However, there are a couple of ways to seriously injure one.  The deadly rays of the sun will instantly cause a vampire's skin to burst into flame (4 points of body damage for every thirty-second round it is exposed).  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the vampire is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to a vampire, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.<BR>

You think they cannot cross running water and they will cast no reflection.  A stake through the heart is all you need to kill them.  They have super strength and unnatural quickness.  Some can fly like a bird while others can shape change into a variety of animals.  All a vampire needs to do is bite you to turn you into one of them.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Symbol:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Faith symbols can be any number of items.  Crucifix, Star of David, little golden Buddha, etc.  They must be actual objects, not a pattern sewn into clothing, for instance.  The object itself has absolutely no power whatsoever.  It is the faith of the wielder that empowers the object.  Holding the faith symbol aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the symbol and the vampire they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the vampire's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the vampire's roll, they are successful.  The vampire must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the vampire from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the vampire may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the vampire will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the vampire is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of a faith symbol will only serve to enrage the vampire, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  It is not possible for one vampire to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>

You think sunlight seriously injures a vampire, as well as fire.  You know which myths from level 1 are, in fact, myths and which are not.  Having studied vampires for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a vampire uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the vampire with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of faith water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the vampire are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the vampire suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The vampire must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the vampire heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Vampire by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Vampire, which happens to be Vamporos.  If you wish to identify the Vampire as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Vampire, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Vampire transform either to or from Vamporos.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Vampire.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Wooden Stakes:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>To kill a vampire, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the vampire's natural healing abilities.  Vampires happen to be susceptible to a wooden stake that penetrates the heart.  The stake must be a piece of wood no smaller than a foot in length and an inch in diameter.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must place the point of the stake over the vampire's heart.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, empowering the stake.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the stake must be driven through the vampire's heart on the round following the roll.  The empowerment does not last any longer than that.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  Since a vampire's body has to be in the negative when they are staked, they are obviously considered prone, no attack roll is necessary.  As the stake passes through the vampire's heart, the faith the character used to empower it is released, spreading throughout the vampire's body.  This causes the body to burn internally and on the following round, the flames will erupt around the body.  Seconds later, nothing will remain of the body as the ashes are extremely thin, disintegrating with any kind of contact.  <BR>

They must consume blood each and every night. The longer they go without feeding, the more monstrous they become.  This degeneration of reason begins after the first day. It is a slow, painful process and the effect will become permanent after the third day.  By the fifth day, the vampire will be completely mad, incapable of rational thought.  This is probably where the rumors about rampaging vampires roaming the countryside come from.  Once the vampire is again able to drink blood, the effects of the insanity will wear off.<BR>
<BR>
Vampires must drink approximately half of the blood in an average sized human to be satisfied. They can either pierce the artery with the fangs they are able to retract at will, located just behind the normal incisors or they can simply cut the victim.  Of course, the bite marks will have to heal normally and will be an obvious wound for a few days, causing 1 point of Body damage to the victim.  Many modern vampires have taken to simply cutting the vessel to cover their supernatural tracks.<BR>
<BR>
Since only half of the blood is necessary, the vampire need not kill its vessel.  However, the ecstatic effect blood had on them makes it very difficult to stop drinking and occasionally results in the death of the host.  This phenomenon is called the Blood Rush.  A vampire that drinks from a vessel must roll 2d6+Will vs a TN of 20.  Vampires who have had their breed change approved for more than three months no longer have to make this roll, even if they are trying to create offspring.  If they succeed, they are able to control themselves and can kill or not kill the victim as they wish.  A failed roll means the vampire is so drawn into the eroticism of the feeding that they are unable to control themselves.  Unless they are physically separated by a third party, they will completely drain the vessel, killing it.<BR>

These effects are best described as hallucinogenic, and vary greatly from vampire to vampire. The only thing that can be said for all vampires is the hallucinations are <I>extremely</I> potent.
