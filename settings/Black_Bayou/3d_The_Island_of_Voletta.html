The island of Isle Voletta lies off the southeast corner of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico. To get to the island from the mainland you have to cross a bridge of about two miles that leads from highway 39, or you could take a small craft through the swamp. The second option isn't done very often because the swamp is like a jungle filled with thick, dark vegetation and there are stories about what goes on out there in those swamps...alligators, snakes...other things. <BR>

The island is over 14 miles long at the longest point and 8 miles wide at the widest point, but only 8 miles by 3 miles is inhabitable.  It's surrounded on two sides and the back by Bayou Savage. To the east of the island lies a smaller chain of islands that begin just south of the Chandeleur Sound and work their way gently to the southwest. There are two major island chains in this long, interconnected island reef. Running from north almost the complete distance to the southwest lie the Chandeleur Islands. A much smaller Curlew Island chain finishes it off and Grand Grosier Island is the last island of the chain. <BR>
<BR>
The city of Voletta lies in the far western part of the island and is approximately 4 miles wide and 2 miles long. Isle Voletta is just a lazy little southern town. You know the kind, antebellum homes with wide porches full of ladder back rockers. Summer afternoons in a midtown park with a circular bandstand. Broad brimmed Panama hats. Ice melting, chinking in empty ice tea glasses with a sprig of mint. Sunday afternoon little league baseball games, with parents running the hot dog stand. Bowling league nights on Wednesdays, and grandma's house for Sunday supper. <BR>
<BR>
Swampland dominates the northern edge of the island. Directly to the northeast of the city lies grassland plains and beyond that to the east lies the forest. On the far east portion of the island is soft highlands from the upper elevations of the island. The swamp permeates almost everything except the rocky highland, making city expansion virtually impossible. <BR>
<BR>
The Bayou Bridge connects to the Bayou Coast Parkway which surrounds the habitable portion of the isle to the Southwest. The Bayou Coast Parkway turns to the Veils Beach Drive toward the southern part of the city of  Voletta. From these access ways you can reach the rest of the city. <BR>
<BR>
Between North Bayou Coast Parkway and North Avenue lies a thick swamp area cut in half by Cedar Creek. There is a small area of the city that branches up into this area from North Avenue. Cedar Creek Drive and Lane Circle Court are the roads that can take you there. North Avenue is where the main portion of Voletta begins. <BR>
<BR>
The city is shaped a bit like a football as seen from above, covering the western part of the island and is laid out in various encompassing shapes that range widely in size. The business district and downtown areas are in the middle of the city and the city fades out as it moves outward toward the swamp or water. Near, and in the swamp, are shanties. Closer to the city center you go, the better the housing and more obviously affluent the residents become.  The only exception to this is the small residential section resting in the northernmost section of the island.  The most prominent and wealthy residents of the island reside there.  Each block has its own stores, parks, etc. The warehouse/docks area runs from south from Billaud Drive to South Square Circle and east from Main Street to the eastern part of the city...cutting out a small piece north of Lunar Trace which belongs to the Entertainment area of town.  That part runs south of Billaud Drive the Veils Beach Drive and east of Veils Beach Drive to meet with the Warehouse/Docks area.  The Business District runs mostly south of North Avenue to Billaud Drive and east of West Bayou Coast Parkway to Main Street.  The small section surrounded by Breaux Lane, Capital Boulevard and Main Street is where the government buildings rest.  The majority of the Residential area runs south from North Avenue to Billaud Drive and east from Main Street to the eastern section of the island.  To drive around the city starting from the North (like coming off the bridge) and traveling clockwise you would start on North Avenue which runs all the way from the west to the east of Voletta. North Avenue becomes Veils Beach Drive. Veils Beach Drive connects with Western Coast Parkway for a short time then you have the option of moving back up to the Bayou Bridge or continue onward to the North Bayou Coast Parkway and circle the island. <BR>
<BR>
There is only one more road, Billaud Drive, that goes completely through the city from east to west. Billaud Drive moves from the Western Bayou Coast Parkway to Veils Beach Drive. The other roads between North Avenue and Billaud Drive that travel from west to east are Rosewood Drive, Capital Boulevard and Poinsettia Road. Roads south of Billaud Drive to Veils Beach Drive that travel from west to east are Lunar Trace, Bordelon Road, Creole Drive, Crescent Drive, Terre Bonne Drive, North Square Circle and South Square Circle. <BR>
<BR>
Three roads go completely through the city from north to south. Breaux Lane, Main Street and Chapeav Court. There are no roads that travel from north to south between the West Bayou Coast Parkway and Breaux Lane. Between Breaux Lane and Main Street one small road connects Bordelan Road and Billaud Drive; Le Bleu Drive. Between Main Street and Chapeav Court lie La Grange Street, La Croix Lane and Lavergne Road. Between Chapeav Court and Veils Beach Drive / North Avenue lies Terrance Boulevard. <BR>
<BR>
There are a wide variety of fairly well known establishments in Isle Voletta. For night spots you can check out the Symposium, located on Veils Beach Drive.  Then there's Lunar Bluez Cafe, Panama Nights Cafe and many, many others. For the more cultured crowd there's the Isle Voletta Symphony or the Theatre de l'Spoir. If shopping is your thing, you can check out The Twisted Music Box which specializes in musical instruments. There are literally dozens of other areas to shop in Voletta...from the ordinary to the down right rare. It is Louisiana after all. There are some business' around the area too, like Magi Technologies, MyCaron Managing Inc. and other fine establishments for those looking for work in the corporate arena. Voletta has three forms of local media; Bayou Bugle Newspaper, The Voletta Squealer and WKRV...Voletta's own television station. There is also a local prominent institution of higher learning in St. George's Academy. For your religious needs there's plenty to choose from, like St. Januarius, along with other places of worship.  If you should happen to need medical attention, the hospital is located on the corner of Billaud Drive and Chapeav Court.  Other places of note are Holy Grounds, a quaint little Coffee Shop that sells almost any book you would desire to own.  To keep fit the isle houses the Sha Tei Tung Temple Dojo, a place not only to hone your physical body, but to raise your spirits to a new hieght.  All these places are availabe to those people who live here, so come and join our community, you'll never forget us.<BR>
