 and their Covens</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
When creating a new coven, there are a few things one should first consider.  Isle Voletta is a good sized island, but the city of Voletta is not all that large.  Lamias rely on privacy and secrecy to hide their breed from the prying eyes of the population in general.  Therefore the size of the island determines how many covens there can be before overpopulation puts them at serious risk of having their breed discovered.  Voletta is large enough for five Mentor lead covens with no more than 13 members each.  If the Mentor tries allow the 14th member into their coven, the attempt will automatically fail.<BR>
<BR>
If there is enough room for a new coven, the Mentor-to-be must have trained four Adepts of their own.  The Mentor-to-be must also have been playing an approved Lamia character sheet for at least 6 months and have Lore level 3 in Lamia.  In order to maintain their Mentor status, they must roleplay for at least 5 days in a character sheet update period.  A Mentor's power comes mostly from the combined magickal energies of their Adepts so the more pupils they surround themselves with that share the same magickal bond, the more power the Mentor has.  The similarity of magickal studies and methology allows the coven to act in unison to perform great feats of magick. His own Adepts are his power, but Mentor know to allows his pupils to build their own covens, weakens him considerably.  As the strength of his Adepts serve to make the Mentor what he is, he cannot permit his pupils to build their own power base.<BR>
<BR>
When an Adept of a Mentor begins to train his own apprentices, the Mentor still benefits, but to a lesser extent.  The Adept acts as a magickal dam between the Mentor and the apprentice.  The Adept, of course, benefits the most from the them.  Apprentices also count toward this coven member total, though the amount of power they return to the Mentor is significantly less than the power given to their teacher.  The Adept acts as a barrier, blocking a direct flow of power to the Mentor, keeping most of it for themselves.  <BR>
<BR>
When an Adept creates 5 or more apprentices of their own, they become a threat to the Mentor.  At that point, the Adept has accumulated enough "magickal power" to break free of the magickal ties of their Mentor.  If there are less than 5 covens total, the Adept that broke free may apply for Mentor status.  If not, they simply lead a coven of rogue Lamia.  Of course, the Mentor who would sit by and let this happen are few and far between.  It is the rogue covens that are the greatest threat to any society.<BR>
<BR>
Each Coven has an innate color associated with it.  The origins of this particular type of Coven identification are lost in the annals of time, but once the Coven forms they automatically know which color they have claimed.  The five possible types for Isle Voletta are red, green, blue, gold and white.  The Mentor has no choice in the color that their Coven receives, as that is the decision of fate itself.  Members from one Coven cannot identify those of other Covens, but they can identify the color type of personnel from their own Circle as an almost visual aura around that person.  Members of a Coven do not have to use the chosen type of color in their clothing or other items, but find an underlying and almost semiconscious and compelling reason to do so.  Due to the fact that the Covens do not necessarily have to have the same bloodline, they are identified by their color type as the Red Coven, Gold Coven, etc.  Either way, to create the coven, the player of the Mentor must submit a Breed Leader Request to</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BBSTMail</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Once approved, the Mentor will have access to the Mentor mastery list until they lose their coven.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Rogue Covens</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Lamia who do no belong to any established coven are considered Rogues.  They are often wary individuals, unable to fit within the laws which govern the covens.  They are often sought out by the covens and eliminated so as to keep the magickal forces being used hidden from prying eyes of the mortal population.  Rogue Lamia present other problems as well.<BR>
<BR>
Rogue Lamia who lead covens do not gain the same benefits as the traditional Mentor of covens do.  They also lack the social prestige of leading a coven.  These two factors are usually enough to inspire even the youngest of Lamia to vie for power.  This means one of the established covens have to be removed to make room for themselves.  Obviously, this tends to lead from political maneuvering, manipulation to the occasional terroristic attacks and so on.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>When the Magic Dies <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>If a lamia dies while they still belong to the Mentor's coven, all of their apprentices automatically become the Adepts of the Mentor, or the next highest lamia on the magickal chain.  For instance:<BR>
<BR>
Mentor<BR>
   Adept 1<BR>
   Adept 2<BR>
       Apprentice 1<BR>
       Apprentice 2<BR>
          Novice 1<BR>
   Adept 3<BR>
<BR>
If Apprentice 2 were to die, their student, "Novice1" would become the student of Adept 2 because that is the next link on the magickal chain on the way to the Mentor.  If Adept 2 were dead or was to die, then Novice 1 would become the student of the Mentor, as would Apprentice 1.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>A note on Rituals:</B> Should you find a mastery below that has a die system listed as Ritual, please use the following rules.  A ritual requires at least 2 other lamia, including the Mentor.  The group assembled must participate in the ritual.  The Mentor is the one that actually makes the die roll, should the mastery require one.  In most cases, the will power of multiple lamia will easily overpower the will of an individual.  The entire group is responsible for paying the soul cost.  It is up to the Mentor to specify who pays what soul.  Participating in rituals is generally considered a thrill for younger lamia and a responsibility for the elder few.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Effect/Description: </B>What breeds independent humans also breeds corruption.  At times, the Mentor may need to reprimand one of their students.  The worst punishment that could befall a lamia is the loss of their spell casting abilities.  This mastery goes a step further.  When the coven joins together, they encircle the victim.  The coven recites an ancient phrase repeatedly throughout the casting.  The Mentor then identifies the victim and calls their crimes out over the chanting of the coven.  The ritual is complete after a period of 5 minutes when the victim is completely stripped of all magical ability for the next 24 hours.  <BR>

System/Duration: </B>Ritual / Scene; takes 15 minutes to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description:</B> The united will of a coven is said to be so powerful they could command nature itself.  This is not far from the truth.  This ritual must take place somewhere in nature.  The coven performs a 15 minute ritual to draw out the type of weather they choose.  The details of the ritual depend on the type of storm and personal choice of the Mentor.  The Mentor makes a roll of 2d6+Will vs a TN 24.  The intensity of the storm depends on how high the Mentor rolls:<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Die Roll       Degree of Storm</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
     24                 Weak<BR>
     28                 Mild<BR>
     32                 Normal<BR>
     36                 Strong<BR>
     40                 Extreme<BR>
<BR>
The type of storm must be one that would be considered natural for the area they are in.  For instance, a coven could not make it snow in the desert, but could make a fierce sandstorm.  The resulting storm will last for about an hour, out of game time.  A Storyteller must be present for this mastery to be used.  Should the roll be failed, the Mentor immediately suffers a tremendous backlash of mental energy that inflicts 10 points of Mind damage.  This special loss of Mind is healed at a rate of 5 points per night, unlike the standard rules of Mind healing.<BR>

System/Duration: </B>2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 2 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>A master of mimicry can learn to focus their shape shifting abilities on others.  By picturing the animal and forcing their will, the Mentor can change the shape of the victim to the animal they chose.  The Mentor must speak an elaborate incantation that the victim can hear while making eye contact.  The incantation is meant as a sort of hypnotic phrase while the eye contact opens the victim to the Mentor's will.  The only limitation is that the animal must be on the Animal Form List in the local category.  While the victim is forced into this alternate physical form, they are clear thinking and rational.  However, they are unable to speak orally, use any kind of mental mastery or change into any other form, if they are normally able due to their breed.  The penalties of communication and mental masteries are still in effect.  The first round of activation is spent speaking the incantation and the second round is the actual shape shifting.<BR>
