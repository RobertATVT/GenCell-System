</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Over the years man has developed many ways of protecting himself.  Whether for competition or blood, mankind has always found reasons to be violent.  Before there was armed combat, there was unarmed (hand-to-hand) combat.<BR>
<BR>
Below, you will find brief descriptions of many hand-to-hand combat styles.  They are all very different and come from many societies and cultures.  In order to purchase a fighting style, you must first purchase a fighting skill.  Each fighting skill offers specific styles that you may choose from, as you will see below.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Bonuses</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Each fighting style grants the character a certain bonus.  These benefits are listed below and will usually affect your character's Modifiers.  You will receive the first bonus from your fighting style once your fighting skill level reaches 4.  When your fighting skill level reaches 8 the original bonus your character received doubles.  Finally, you multiply the original bonus level 4 granted the character by 3 when the they reach level 12 in their fighting skill.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>For Instance:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I> </B></I>If you had Pakua Level 4, you would be able to add +2 to your Attack Modifier and +1 to your Initiative Modifier.  At level 8 Pakua, your total bonus would be +4 Attack Modifier and +2 Initiative Modifier for being an expert.  At level 12, your total bonus would be +6 Attack Modifier and +3 Initiative Modifier for being a master in that style.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Limitations</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
You are limited by the number of fighting styles your character knows, depending on which fighting skills you have purchased.  Here is the breakdown:<BR>
2 Street Fighting styles<BR>
1 Street Fighting Style and 1 Trained Fighting style<BR>
1 Fighting Mastery style.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Note:</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The bonuses granted with these styles apply to directly what they say.  A + to the attack modifier is to the modifier in general, and not only for when that skill is used, unless otherwise noted in the form description.  For instance, damage bonuses only apply during hand-to-hand fighting, not when attacking with firearms or melee weapons.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Changing Styles</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
At times, it may become necessary to learn a new martial art.  One that might cause a conflict with the limitations.  This most commonly occurs due to a change in Breed.  When you have a Fighting Mastery and you change breeds, the procedure is rather simple.  You remove the old fighting mastery and replace it with the new fighting mastery after dividing the previous level in half (rounded up).  If you choose to drop a fighting style so you may pick up one, you may do so.  Keep in mind, you will not receive any rebate for dropping these levels.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Barfighting:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>The standard style of training from Australia to New York and most of the south.  A standard, brutal brawling match.  The best way to beat your foe is to duck, letting them smack the guy behind you with that chair.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Street Boxing:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  This is the standard street fighting, knuckle-busting you might see in the dark alley down the street.  It is the base skill of any professional boxer in the ring and every thug on the street.<BR>
<BR>

The best defense is a better offense and students learn to put their opponent down quickly and safely.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Capoeira:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  A fighting style designed by Brazilian slaves, meant to look like a fast paced dance so they would not be punished if caught "fighting".  This style is rarely taught outside Brazil and is most often used today as a form of entertainment.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Chi:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>This is a Mortal's "spiritual" based art that focuses on bringing the inner strength of the mind to the physical front.  This extreme focus helps the student react quicker and more efficiently in combat.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Commando Training:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  This is the next step in personal self-defense spawned from Cadet Training.  It requires more intense training, thus making the student better able to take a foe down quickly, regardless of the force.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Direction:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Perhaps the opposite of Iphagra, this skill is designed to be quick, allowing the angel to avoid being seriously injured while quickly trying to subdue their opponent.  The best way to stop an Angel is to kill it, this style is based on resisting that belief.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Iphagra:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> An art of Demons, designed specifically to cause as much pain as possible while making death as slow as possible.  Demons with this skill exude a kind of evil confidence, owning someone's life in their hands; thus the increased willpower these vile creatures tend to have.<BR>
<BR>

The most useful movements in this art are the speed in which they move.  After throwing a punch or claw, they are gone before the victim can touch them.  This fighting style does not grant the use of claws in mortal form, and to use this mastery with claws you would need to be in Vamporos form.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Kai:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Not known for physical confrontation, the Lamia have developed a fighting style that enhances their ability to react faster than their opponent.  Their philosophy being, "the best way to avoid injury is not to be hit".  This allows them to cast their spells before they get attacked or to keep from being distracted. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Lycanitsu:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  This is a wicked martial art that uses a Werewolves' astounding strength and feroscity to over power and rend their victims.  Regardless of their form, their animal instincts and beastly strength rips through their victims, thearing them to bloody stumps.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Ninjitsu:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>This is the ancient art of information gathering and assassination.  It is more of a way of life than a simple martial art.  If a ninja is forced to fight, they have typically already failed in their mission.  Their methods are quick and deadly.  They are used to kill or otherwise eliminate an opponent as quick and silently as possible.  The secrets of this martial art are so carefully guarded, we cannot even tell you more of it.  Your bakground must have an exceptional reason for you to learn this martial art.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Pakua:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  A surprisingly powerful Chinese art designed around the I-Ching.  Mentally placing the I-Ching circle around the target, the Pakua "fighter" circles their target until finding a favorable fortune, at which point they strike!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>6th Sense:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Through years of training, the Psychic may learn how to enhance their fighting by using their ability to predict their opponents moves as well as enhance their own, on a limited basis of course.  Their training keeps their mind sharp, and in perfect tune with their body.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>TaiCh'iCh'uan:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  The ancient art of self-defense, drawing its strength from the mind.  The moves are crisp and precise.  The mind is focused, meant only for defence, it can be used to kill those the master deems unworthy for redemption. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Wrestling:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Although it may be fake on television, if you really put those moves on someone in real-life without padding it you'd probably kill them.  This is the technique of placing joint snapping moves, bone crushing slams and unbreakable holds on an opponent.<BR>
