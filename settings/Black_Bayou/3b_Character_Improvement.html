</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Experience Points (XP) are the means with which we measure our character's individual growth.  Just as the sheets represent our character's physical traits, the experience points represent the knowledge and skill our characters have achieved while we've been playing.  Experience points are earned in a variety of ways (as described below) and we make note of them on our character sheets.  At a later time, we can spend these points to make improvements to our character sheet.  Each skill level, mastery and statistic have a specific experience point cost.  That means we must have the appropriate number of experience points to purchase them.  Once we've spent our experience points on something, they are gone until we've earned some more.<BR>
<BR>
Remember the most important thing to keep in mind when you considering improving your character sheet is to consider it within two months of your last character sheet approval.  If you do not submit your character sheet for approval at least once every two months you run the risk of loosing those XP that you have earned.  Also, we ask that you only submit an update once a month.  That means, when you receive you approved character sheet via email, you should check the date.  You will have to wait until that day on the following month before you will be allowed a character sheet update.  We'll discuss the process for submitted the various character sheet updates at length later.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>Posting: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>You may also earn experience points for posting short stories about your character's actions.  These stories can involve anything you'd like, so long as it pertains to your character.  A group of volunteers goes through all the posts weekly and will award anywhere from </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>1 - 10 XP</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> per week, depending on the quality of the posts.  Should you include another player's character when you write your post, be sure to have permission from them before you send it.  Experience points earned from postings may only be used for the character sheet the story was written about.  You will be notified of any experience points you have earned from posting via email from the Experience Point Department.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>Gamemasters: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> When they are available, we offer trained Gamemasters to assist you with the story lines you submit.  There are many advantages to having a Gamemaster run a story line for you, the most notable for this section is their ability to award experience points for individual role-play.  These awards can range anywhere from </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>1 - 5 XP</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> per session.  Awards of this type are based on the following:  Showing up, effort, role-play, ingenuity, etc.  These experience awards may only be used on the character sheet you are playing at the time they are awarded.  You will be notified via email when you have earned experience points from a Gamemaster.  A list of Gamemasters can be found here: <A HREF="aol://4344:1192.bbstaff.9390437.578464856">Black Bayou Staff</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <BR>

This works exactly the same as earning a point for playing in the main room.  Should you happen to role-play in the main room for an hour and then play during an event (such as the Casino or Arena), then you will have earned a total of 2 experience points for the night.  These experience awards may only be used with the character sheet you are playing with at the time.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>Staff Members: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>Staff members earn experience points for their voluntary work in Black Bayou.  The points are based off of an average amount of time in hours spent working their particular area during a seven day week.  To ensure that no staff member may make more than 1.5 times more points than any player, a current cap of 105 points has been placed on staff member Character Sheets per monthly update.  The 105 includes both staff points and any others they may earn through role-playing, posting, etc.  This cap is placed on any Character Sheet with Staff Points listed on it, though the cap doesn't reflect Staff owned sheets that don't have Staff Points listed - which is common occurrence if a staff member owns more than one CS.  No other exceptions are allowed.  The following points are earned per week:<BR>

Should you choose to buy more than one level of a Statistic at a time, you must purchase each level separately.  For instance, if you wanted to raise your Body from level 4 to level 6, it would cost a total of 38 experience points.  17 points for level 5 and 21 points for level 6.  You may not raise a statistic above your breed maximum, even due to a breed change.<BR>

If you wish your character to learn a new skill or improve an existing one, consult the following chart.  Find the skill you're interested in and find it's experience point cost per level.  Multiply the level you want to purchase by the number listed under the experience point cost to find out how many XP you will need to spend.  Occupational Training alters the cost of purchasing skill levels, so be sure to check the description of your character's occupation in case you are offered a discounted cost. Should you choose to buy more than one level of a Skill at a time, you must purchase each level separately.  For instance, if you wanted to raise your Evasion Skill from level 4 to level 6, it would cost a total of 33 experience points.  15 points for level 5 and 18 points for level 6.  For each of the following updates, remember that some Occupations have different update costs listed.  If you have an Occupation with a different cost, use the update cost of your Occupation.<BR>

When you're getting ready to submit an update to your character sheet it is important for you to know what you are sending us, and what you might receive in return.  Lets go over some of the terminology for various character sheet titles that are approved by the Character Sheet Department.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Update:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  An update is the general term for a character sheet that has been updated with experience points in any of the manners described above.  Once you've accumulated experience points for your character and have spent them, the next step is to have your updated character sheet approved.  Go ahead and make the necessary changes to your character sheet.  At the bottom of the sheet, you'll notice the Experience Point Record section.  Each time you submit a character sheet, you must list where the experience points come from.  That way we will be more able to process your update with as little difficulty as possible.  After you've listed where you earned the points, you should then list where these points have been spent.  This enables us to approve your sheet at a glance, which will ensure your updated sheet is active as soon as possible.  When submitting a character sheet for an update, please be sure to send it in the body of an email to <A HREF="mailto:BBST Mail">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>with the subject: <screen name> CS Update.  Make sure you list the type of experience points earned and give the date the points were earned upon (the days you Role-played in <A HREF="aol://2719:3-1795-Black%20Bayou%20II">Black Bayou II</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> for an hour and the date you received any Email awarded experience points) in the appropriate columns in the experience point record.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Non-Update:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  A Non-update is similar to an update except there is no experience points spent in a non-update.  When you submit a non-update you still need to fill out your experience point record with all the experience points you have earned since your character sheet was last approved, even though you are not spending them.  Then why send in the character sheet if your not updating it you ask?  And why give those character sheets a special name?  Well, Non-Updates are often submitted by players who are saving up their experience points for an expensive mastery or statistic upgrade and don't want to lose their experience points to what is called "the two month reactivation rules."  Players who just haven't earned that many experience points also send in Non-Updates to avoid the reactivation rules as well.  The reactivation rules are the subject of our next character sheet type.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Reactivation:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  A character sheet reactivation happens when you submit a character sheet to us that has aged more than two months.  Why do we care that you send in your character sheet within two months?  So that we can guarantee you, the player, that we will have your character sheet if you need it for the various functions of the game including updating.  The longer you wait on submitting your character sheet to us after two months the worse your chances will get that someone currently on Black Bayou Staff will have your character sheet.  If we don't have a copy of your character sheet on record then we cannot let you play the game with the sheet or update it.  We want to try to keep accurate records of which characters are actually playing and accurate totals of the breeds.  So, if your character sheet goes longer then two months without being submitted it will be moved in classification to inactive.  If you want to reactivate your character one of two options will have to chosen regarding your character sheet.  Option one, you forget about ever having a previous character sheet for the character and start all over generating a new CS (this may be restricted by breed locks at the time).  Or you can lose all the XP in-between the last update before the sheet went inactive and the time your reactivating it and get the character sheet back as it was.  If you ever find yourself in need of reactivating a character sheet simply wipe you experience point record of any unspent points (experience points already used in previous updates will not be lost) and send it to <A HREF="mailto:BBST Mail">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> with a subject line of <screen name> Reactivation.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Freezing:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  We understand that there are sometimes circumstances in your lives be it vacations, college, etc....that may prevent you from making an update within two months of your character sheets last approval.  If you know you will be unable to make a character sheet update within the required time simply send a note to <A HREF="mailto:BBST Mail?subject=CS Freeze Request">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> requesting your character sheet to be frozen.  If you have the time to plan on it in advance include your character sheet with the experience point record filled out for the XP you have earned since your last update.  If you are requesting the freeze on the fly or your way out the door then just send a cut and paste copy of your last CS approval and be prepared to claim those XP when you get back.  A properly frozen character sheet will not earn any new experience points, and neither will it loose any experience points already earned, it will remain exactly as the title reads, frozen, until you return and ask us to thaw it for you.  If you own a Demon, Angel or Breed Leader CS, and are a multi-character player, ALL of your characters must be frozen at one time, not just one or two.  If you do not own a Demon, Angel or Breed Leader, you can freeze any amount of characters you wish.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>SN Change:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  This one is pretty self explanatory, if you ever need to change the screen name that you play a character sheet under simply inform us at <A HREF="mailto:BBST Mail?subject=Screen Name Change">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> and send us a copy of your character sheet.  Please try your best to send the Email from your current/old screen name rather than your new screen name so we can be sure its a valid screen name change.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Breed Change:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  A Mortal has the potential to become any of the supernatural breeds in the game.  When your character undergoes a breed change you'll need to transfer your character sheet data over to the character sheet that is found for their new breed in <A HREF="aol://4344:1192.breeds.9390572.578698355">The Breeds And Their Powers</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> and add any bonuses/meet the breed change requirements listed for your breed listed on that same page.</HTML>
