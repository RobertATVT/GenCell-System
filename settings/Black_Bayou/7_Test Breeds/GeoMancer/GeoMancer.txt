Throughout time, there have been many people who seemed to find their calling in the works of earth.  Making their trade with intimate knowledge of the sand, soil, and mineral, they are the true green thumbs of the planet.  From the famed Hanging Gardens of Babylon to the rich floating gardens of the Aztecs, there have always been signs of their abilities.  It is their call, to bring the Earth to life.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> A GeoMancer will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would<BR>
require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e. a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains. <BR>
How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  Wounds created by either fire or salt water take twice as long to heal than normal.<BR>

Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue. You believe GeoMancers can control the ecology, and even grow their own jungles.  They can make plants grow in<BR>
a day, and heaven forbid if you ever swallow a watermelon seed.  On the other hand, GeoMancers have saved the lives of many endangered species by maintaining their natural habitat.  GeoMancers could be all around you, but it's all good, just head down to the local green house.  They are sure to find just the right flora to add to your decor.<BR>

Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false. You've learned that GeoMancers can die just like anyone else. <BR>
You've also learned that their abilities are more subtle than you thought at first.  Most of the time, they have no desire to cause harm to others.  When a GeoMancer uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the GeoMancer use Will,<BR>
Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

The seeds themselves hold no power.  It is the faith of the sewer that empowers them.  By scattering a handful of seeds around them, they, they can create a barrier around them that can resist GeoMancer abilities, including stopping growth.  A full round must be taken for the scattering and concentration, and the seeds must be scattered in soil for this to work.  After the round of concentration, the player must roll 2d6+Soul+Faith Vs a TN 22.  If they succeed, the empowerment of the seeds is successful and will last for an entire scene, or until they leave the circle around them. The GeoMancer will be unable to affect them in any way, as they will be unable to cross the barrier created by the seeds.  If the person has used the mustard seeds to surround the GeoMancer, the GeoMancer will be trapped, unable to move from the circle or use masteries (including mindspeak) outside the radius of the barrier.<BR>

You've learned all that is truth about these "gifted" individuals.  When a GeoMancer uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Pesticide Water: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Pesticide water is little more than water mixed with any household pesticide and soil.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough pesticide water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the<BR>
GeoMancer with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of Pesticide water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith Vs, TN 22.  This roll<BR>
must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  The concentration is to make sure there is a correct balance of pesticide and water, complimenting the solution, or the concoction will topple and be ineffective. Attacks made against the GeoMancer are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful,<BR>
the GeoMancer suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The GeoMancer must heal the damage as any normal mortal would, except at twice the normal rate.  That would mean each point of damage would take 6 days to heal rather than 3.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the GeoMancer heal faster at the maximum rate of normal healing speed.  Pesticide water wounds cause disfiguring scars that will eventually heal<BR>
after a months time.<BR>

When one chooses to become a GeoMancer, they find themselves drawn to the wilderness.  Weather it be a run down shack out in the swamp, or a beautiful mansion in the heart of the city, the GeoMancer will surround their home will all types of vegetation.  A fence<BR>

The Earth is their sanctuary, and only act's of mother Earth are they willingly to accept for destruction.  A wildfire started by lightening is something they can understand, clearing away the old land to give birth to the new, but to actively harm the environment will cause them to fight to the best of their ability to save the habitat.<BR>

When something happens that threatens the environment within a limited radius of the GeoMancer, they will here the Earth's call, and rush immediately towards the scene.  (Note:  Though anything that happens to the Earth can bring about this innate ability, it is up to the ST's or host's discretion as to weather or not the GeoMancer can feel it<BR>
if it is even in question).  The size of the threat is directly related to how far away the GeoMancer can be called.  Someone chopping down a tree a mile away isn't going to alert them, but toxic dumping or a forest fire several miles away will.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  GeoMancers, used to the open spaces of nature, can sometimes feel crowded in, especially when someone they don't care for decides to give them more attention than they want.  Having studied plants of all kinds, they have learned to mimic the way some species have the ability to ward off unwanted attention.  By concentrating on the target, the GeoMancer can exude a presence that makes the target uncomfortable, causing them to move away.  The target does not flee the vicinity, only lose interest in the GeoMancer and leave to find other company<BR>

Certain physical deformities can also be brought about, but only to a limited extent.  Scars left by damage from fire or abuse can be taken away, but a lost limb or handicap cannot be regenerated.  By drawing from the nutrients of the Earth and their own inner strength, the<BR>
GeoMancer can remedy poison, cure a snake bite, even lessen the damage caused by fire, taking on the pain themselves.  In this manner, they can give up to 2 body to the target from themselves per round.  For every body point given to target, the GeoMancer loses that body point.  The target cannot gain more than their current body stat, and the GeoMancer will stop once their body reaches 1.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will Vs 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Sometimes, you just have to give someone the cold shoulder, or a hot foot.  A GeoMancer doesn't have to like everyone.  In fact, some people are just down right annoying, their voice adding only to the noise pollution.  When so faced with someone they do not care for, the GeoMancer can summon a small change in temperature to settle around the person in question, leaving a discomforting feeling upon them.  This causes the<BR>
target victim to experience a sudden outward change that cannot be readily explained, but giving enough discomfort to have them move from the general area to seek more hospitable temperature.  Physical contact is required for this ability to work.  This causes no physical damage to the target.  This is also not limited to people.  The GeoMancer can cause an object to experience a lenient change in the extreme temperature zone, such as making a<BR>
metallic object feel as if has been out in the sun for hours on end, or putting an icy chill to something.  If someone is carrying or holding the target object, it will also be affected them, becoming quite uncomfortable and require the removal of said object, weather it be jewelry, weapon or otherwise.  Failure to do so will cause -1 to body from blistering or frostbite.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will Vs victim's 2d6+Will / last 1 round; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> As an extension of Gaia's touch, the GeoMancer sometimes finds himself in a combat situation where he must defend himself.  Most GeoMancers do not look for confrontation, but instead avoid it whenever possible.  When faced with a fight or flight situation, they can call upon the Earth to help them, causing an extreme temperature change within the direct vicinity.  A temporary green house effect surrounds the victim,<BR>
rendering them unable to breath and suffering from the sudden intense heat.  The victim's next round will be spent recovering from the effect, and they cannot attack that round.  If the GeoMancer uses this, it is to avoid further conflict.  They will not attack the victim, but may stand around and wait for the effect to wear off and attempt to talk, or flee the scene.  This may only be used on a particular character once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will Vs, TN 20 / scene; takes 2 turns to complete the cage.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>   When dealing with nature, the GeoMancer can come across all types of obstacles, be it a wild animal who has a taste for flesh, or a wealthy tycoon looking to make the next parking lot over the GeoMancer's favorite garden.  When reason has not worked, and yet a confrontation is still needed, the GeoMancer can concentrate his abilities, and cause the ground beneath them to give rise to a natural enclosure.  The type of cage<BR>
made is determined by the natural plants of the region, weather it be vines, trees, or the like.  These natural cages are weak against fire, and can be destroyed by such in 2 rounds.  There are three levels of natural Cage, each adding strength to the prison, which can be subsequently purchased.<BR>
<B>Level 1</B>:  The smaller floral will attack, encircling the victim with vines like a netting.  Victim may roll 2d6 + body Vs., TN 14 to break the vines and escape.<BR>
<B>Level 2:</B>  With more practice, the GeoMancer can command larger plants to bend to their will, causing a usurp of plants, bushes, and small trees to enclose the victim within.  The Victim may roll 2D6 + Body Vs. TN 16 to break through and escape.<BR>
<B>Level 3: </B> The GeoMancer can become so intoned with his environment that Mother Earth will come to his aid, causing rampant growth around the Victim, where even the trees bend to the will of the GeoMancer, surrounding the victim within Nature's grasp, allowing little chance for escape.  The Victim may roll 2D6 + Body Vs. TN 20 to break free, and escape the cage.. <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>   Everyone likes to have fun, and the GeoMancers are not without their own practical jokes.  By concentrating on someone for a round, a GeoMancer can cause a limited area of the target's body to break out in a rash of poison ivy.  The area of effect is limited, but chosen by the GeoMancer.  Many hours have been spent in amusement as the GeoMancer watches someone stress and move to relieve a prominent rash in the unreachable part of their back.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Sometimes a GeoMancer is forced into conflict, despite his or her personal beliefs.  When using this Mastery in a naturally formed area, the GeoMancer quickly shifts into a large plant, resembling a Venus Fly Trap.  Four, large ten foot tentacles come from the body as the head and shoulders slowly change into a petals.  The feet slowly seep into the earth and root themselves there.  The GeoMancer gains a +2 to body, but because of limited ability to move, suffers a -3 to initiative and dodge.  With one tentacle per round the GeoMancer may lash out at his opponent.  Only Dissention (GeoMancer fighting Mastery) and Natural Weapons may be used in this form.  However, the GeoMancer may utilize other ways to attack or defend itself, such as throwing.  As always, this is left to the discretion of the ST (Storyteller).  After a successful Body vs. Body roll for the grapple, the next round the GeoMancer may engulf his target and hold his opponent prone.  During this time, the opponent begins being drained of -2 per round until unconscious.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  As a GeoMancer has the ability to repulse people, so have they too developed the ability to attract people.  Though nothing can break the bonds of love someone has for another or quench the rage of hate for someone else, the GeoMancer can though concentration make their target feel more at ease with them, enjoying their company.  The target will not know why they have the sudden attraction to the GeoMancer, they will remember everything they do.  This does not release inhibitions, though many a GeoMancer has used illegal substances to compound the effect.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Being one with the earth, the GeoMancer has found a way to avoid and even escape certain battle situations.  By concentrating, the GeoMancer may sink six feet below the surface without a trace.  Anyone witnessing will see the GeoMancer as if they are sinking in quicksand.  In this manner, the GeoMancer may hide from aggressors.  The earth supplies ventilation so that the GeoMancer does not suffocate.  Also, if tracked by scent, the GeoMancer will have seemed to have simply been at one point and then suddenly vanished, leaving no trail.  However, several drawbacks exist.  One is the inability to gain food and the GeoMancer will become weak.  Two, the passage of time.  After two hours beneath the surface, the GeoMancer will lose sense of time and whether it is day or night (must be roleplayed).  The GeoMancer may also use this on someone else, rendering them prone in the ground to save them from an attacker.  (2D6 + Will Vs. 2D6 Vs Will).  The effect can be dismissed by the GeoMancer, or it wears off after 2 hours.<BR>
