A shapeshifter is a creature with certain genetic manlfunctions resulting in unusual DNA. This unusual DNA allows a person to 'Shift' into anything from objects to people. As the normal human DNA breaks down, the abilities possessed by a shifter increases dramatically allowing he/she to take on forms such as pets, weapons, and even other people. By absorbing the DNA of others, the Shifter can rewrite his/her own DNA strands to take on those of the absorbed. Eventually more complex forms can be taken on, the Shifters own DNA breaking more and his ability to control DNA increasing. Also, after hard training, a Shifter can produce more than one form at once. Don't be surprised if you see a Shifter with the head of a man, body of a motorcycle, and arms of machine guns going down the street.<BR>
<BR>
Because of the substances that the Shifter is compossed of, it does not bleed, but instead, parts of it's goopy substance may ooze out of a Shifted Form. In the STF, a shifter is compossed of no bones or organs, thus if a person decides to stab a Shifter, the blade may possibly go all the way through and come out the back. Bullets can easily get lodged in the gooey substances of the Shifter. Though a Shifter will still take body damage from the wounds, it may still heal at a rate much faster than most others. This is due to the fact that a Shifter is only required to 'Meand' his wounds. Because of the lack of bones and blood, all a Shifter does to heal is meand the wound's entry and it's exit if there is any and restore the path that any weapon or object may have taken. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming: </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>Creating a Shifter is not an easy process. First, the blue gooey substance of the Shifter must be extracted by the Shifter attempting the sire. Exactly 20 CCs of the substance must be taken, no more and no less. A will roll vs a TN of 20 is required to ensure that exactly 20 CCs is taken of the substance. Within the next hour of the extraction, the substance must be injected directly to the heart in order to be realeased through the bloodstream in time. Within the next 24 hours, the tainted blood will travel through the body, the DNA of the victim being rewritten slowly. Before the same hour the day after the sire, all bones, muscles,  and organs will be turned to dust to flow through the bloodstream thus making it impossible for the sired to move in any way shape or form. All of this dust will go through the bloodstream until it is vomited out. Within the next 6 hours, the new Shifter's remaining hair, skin, and blood will all turn pale blue, the gooey substance taking form. Finally, within the next 6 hours, the DNA will be completely rewritten and the new Shifter will be in the Unshifted form for the first time. The Shifter will start out at Shift Level 0 until he/she buys new levels.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>There is only one thing that can truly kill a Shifter (see Lore Level 3 below for details).  However, there are a couple of ways to seriously injure one.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Shifters.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><I>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>You have watched many horror movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You believe that Shifters are the result of a radioactive attack and attacks may be prevented by wearing led. You believe that if you get too near a Shifter, you will become one of them as well do to the radiation effects. You believe they can alter their form into anything. They never get sick, they never grow old and they can ever die.. naturally.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Symbol:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Faith symbols can be any number of items.  Crucifix, Star of David, little golden Buddha, etc.  They must be actual objects, not a pattern sewn into clothing, for instance.  The object itself has absolutely no power whatsoever.  It is the faith of the wielder that empowers the object.  Holding the faith symbol aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the symbol and the Shifter they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the Shifter's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the Shifter's roll, they are successful.  The Shifter must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the Shifter from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the Shifter may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the Shifter will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the Shifter is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of a faith symbol will only serve to enrage the Shifter, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  It is not possible for one vampire to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of Shifters.  Having read everything at the local booksellers, to the more arcane legends, you believe you know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false.    You know which myths from level 1 are, in fact, myths and which are not.  Having studied Shifters for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  Should a Shifter attempt to absorb a form with you as the target roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll.<BR>
 <BR>
<B>Fresh </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Faith Water:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Fresh<B> </B>Faith water is little more than water empowered with the character's faith. The water must be pure starilized water having no salt or other elements mixed in. It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the Shifter with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of fresh faith water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the Shifter are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the Shifter suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally due to the breaking down of the gooey material that the Shifter is compossed of.  The Shifter must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Shifter heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 3:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>You have studied Shifters most of your life, and perhaps you've even known a few.  The rituals required to pass the curse of Shifterism are known to you. Having studied Shifters for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities. Should a Shifter attempt to absorb a form with you as the target roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Shifter by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Shifter, which happens to be Unshifted.  If you wish to identify the Shifter as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Shifter, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Shifter transform either to or from Unshifted.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Vampire.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hydrochloric</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Acid</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>To kill a Shifter, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the Shifter's natural healing abilities.  Shifters happen to be susceptible to very strong acids in large ammounts. A large vial or bottle of hydrochloric acid of no less than one quart must be used.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must pour entire amount of hydrochloric acid over the Shifter's Unshifted form.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, empowering the stake.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the acid must be poured within the next round. The empowerment does not last any longer than that.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  Since a Shifter's body has to be in the negative when the acid is poured, they are obviously considered prone, no attack roll is necessary.  As the acid spreads over the Shifter's form, the faith the character used to empower it is released, spreading throughout the Shifter's DNA.  This causes the bonds that form the Shifter to break up completely.  Seconds later, nothing will remain of the body as the mulecules and atoms are turned to carbon and escape into the air.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Because of the substances the Shifter is compossed of, they are only required to 'mend' any damage they take. By going into a deep sleep while in the Unshifted form, the bonds within the Shifter reform themselves to heal any damage. Because of the lack of bones, blood, and organs, the Shifter may heal 1 body of damage per quarter hour. The Shifter cannot be distracted or else the time must be spent again. Should the Shifter attempt to heal in a Shifted form, they may only receive 1 body per hour. Because the bonding process is more difficult and complex with DNA more complex than the Unshifted DNA.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>Unshifted Form </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use.  (##TSF##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> When the Shifter is not currently in a Shifted form, it must be in the Unshifted form. This form is the simplest for the Shifter to take on because of the simple DNA, thus making it very natural for a Shifter to be in this form. When in this form a Shifter is made up entirely of the pale blueish goo. It would be like holding very maleable clay if someone were to touch it. The goo may constrict and contract to move the Shifter about, but that is all. Shifters do not have eyes, but instead slit with which they can take in their surroundings. Keep in mind that this form is lacking bones, so without a higher level of Shift, a Shifter will only be a large blob of the goo. This form may be taken on at any time. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Shift- 0.  (Shift- level of Shift <target object>)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/ Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By mastering the DNA and molecular bonds of the Shifter, a Shifter can rewrite its very own DNA in order to form different objects. Keep in mind that any weapons must be used with the appropriate skill. Should a hand be shifted into a Gun, you would use small arms. You may only use shifts that you have successfully absorbed. All absorbed forms should be listed on your charactersheet with the level to the side. At the bottom of you character sheet attach links to every posted absorbtion, for these are the only forms you may legally take on. Level 0 Shift is innate and thus costs no XP. However, ever level past level 0 costs 10 Generation Points or 50 Experience Points. You will receive no additions to your stats, though you will also not receive any negatives.<BR>
<BR>
Level 0- You may only shift into your original human form prior to the sire. You may  also shift into the Unshifted form at will.<BR>
<BR>
Level 1- You have enough control over your DNA to take on the form of very small, uncomplicated objects such as a jar or a bowl. You may even be a patch of ice or a fire. Though, should the ice melt, you'll be pulled out of the shift. Should you shift into fire and it blows out, you'll immeadiatly jump out of the shift. Because you won't have any eyes or ears, you cannot hear or see anything going. You will also not feel pain.<BR>
<BR>
Level 2- You may now take on the form of a weapon or object. Keep in mind that you cannot fire yourself or possition yourself to fire. You may only be fired by another person.<BR>
<BR>
Level 3- You have created a strong enough hold on yourself so that you may take on the form of small, very uncomplicated life such as worms, ants, bees, flies, spiders, ect. <BR>
<BR>
Level 4- You have built your abilities enough to shift into a smaller creature such as a dog, cat, or even a mountain lion. No supernatural breeds or shifts are included in this<BR>
<BR>
Level 5- Using your powers as a shifter, you may now take on more than one shift at once. You could be a Tigar with a knife growing out of your head, or a dog with a for a tail. You may only take two forms at a time like this.<BR>
<BR>
Level 6- You can now take on the forms of any creature or object. This includes Humans, Vampires, Horus, ect. <BR>
<BR>
Level 7- You have reached the level in which you can take on any form that you have absorbed. You may now also shift as many times as you like with as many combinations as you choose. You may have a horus but instead of having legs, attached to your belly is a car. You can fire bullets yourself. You can drive yourself. So long as you have eyes in the form, you may see.<BR>
<BR>
Level 8- This is the ultimate form that any Shifter may reach. This form is a combination of the Unshifted and the Shifted form. In this form, you may take on anything you wish with as many combinations as you choose without the need of aborbing. You also gain an unnatural strength when you shift to level 8. Because of the added speed and quickness of mastering your body after a great deal of practice, you now receive a +3 to all attack rolls. This includes inits and dodge.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Absorb - 0 Soul to use.  (Absorb- Level of Absorbtion <target object>)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to take in the DNA of other objects or people, you have to 'absorb' the DNA from them. All Absorbtion rolls must be post and linked. Each absorbtion must be listed on you character sheet along with the level. The link to the absorbtion posts must be placed on the character sheet as well. Absorbtion rolls may only be witnessed by STs. Levels for each form to be absorbed must be given by the ST. The roll for innanimate objects or NPCs is Body vs TN 14. In order to absorb another PC's DNA, you must roll Body vs Body. This is because the Shifter's body must take in the DNA, but the PC's body may attempt to reject the absorbtion process.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Fighting Mastery</B></I>- Morph- By using skills to morph about, perhaps to use the morph to have more flexibilty, the Shifter is able to dodge attacks easier than normal. <BR>

Level 5- Using your powers as a shifter, you may now take on more than one shift at once. You could be a Tigar with a knife growing out of your head, or a dog with a for a tail. You may only take two forms at a time like this.<BR>
<BR>
Level 6- You can now take on the forms of any creature or object. This includes Humans, Vampires, Horus, ect. <BR>
<BR>
Level 7- You have reached the level in which you can take on any form that you have absorbed. You may now also shift as many times as you like with as many combinations as you choose. You may have a horus but instead of having legs, attached to your belly is a car. You can fire bullets yourself. You can drive yourself. So long as you have eyes in the form, you may see.<BR>
<BR>
Level 8- This is the ultimate form that any Shifter may reach. This form is a combination of the Unshifted and the Shifted form. In this form, you may take on anything you wish with as many combinations as you choose without the need of aborbing. You also gain an unnatural strength when you shift to level 8. Because of the added speed and quickness of mastering your body after a great deal of practice, you now receive a +3 to all attack rolls. This includes inits and dodge.<BR>

<B>Absorb - 0 Soul to use.  (Absorb- Level of Absorbtion <target object>)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to take in the DNA of other objects or people, you have to 'absorb' the DNA from them. All Absorbtion rolls must be post and linked. Each absorbtion must be listed on you character sheet along with the level. The link to the absorbtion posts must be placed on the character sheet as well. Absorbtion rolls may only be witnessed by STs. Levels for each form to be absorbed must be given by the ST. The roll for innanimate objects or NPCs is Body vs TN 14. In order to absorb another PC's DNA, you must roll Body vs Body. This is because the Shifter's body must take in the DNA, but the PC's body may attempt to reject the absorbtion process.<BR>
