Becoming- </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B></I>Throughout the period of time that these abominations have dwelled the material plane, they have begun recreating the mysterious nature of magics from which they became. Harnessing the power of both realms that they have walked, that of the material and spiritual, they gather the enregies into one location amid the planes, pulling body and soul into one formation, the embodiment of stone.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>To become a gargoyle, the gargoyle (in true form) creating the change must enter an hour long trance within line of sight of both the new host body, and the spirit (person) that will contain it. After the hour of meditation, the predetermined stone body begins to draw out the persons soul leaving behind an empty husk. For the soul to make it's journey into the spirit trap a roll is required so that the spirit does not become lost and is guided.(soul roll vs tn?) If the roll is not made the soul will be erased from the material plane left to roam the spiritual regions for all eternity. (I want to keep the risk of loosing the character.)<BR>

The spirits housed in the living stone are used to the alter regions of the spiritual plane, and have devised a form of communication that would other wise go unnoticed to others around them. This type of communication is completely oppisite to our own as it is sent in silence in repeated patterns much like morse code. Silent whispers is a breed only skill which is represented like mind speech.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I><BR>

Perch-(#Perch#) </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B>0 soul to use</I> - Perch allows the gargoyle to assume it's resting position, be it on the side of a building or as a statue standing solitary. Upon entering it's perch the gargoyle is encased in stone and thus begins it's resting period for the day. Incased in stone, the gargoyle heals all previous damage incurred the following night. It is assumed if no room command is given that the gargoyle takes it's perch after RP is played out. Using Perch before RP is completed results in the gargoyle remaining in stone untill the following night, risking whatever damage that may inccur.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Upon taking this form the Gargoyle takes an appearnce similar to the one they might have resembled in the material plane. The image they choose is final, and looks just like any normal mortal..however looks are not exactly as they were when they were originally alive, as spirits commonly have difficulty with faulty memories of their past lives. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I><BR>

Depending on approved description, the beast like being within shows it's true self. Not always representitive of the emotions it hides, these bodies were made from the creative talents of past.

Masteries~<BR>

Aegis - </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I> 1 Soul to use.  (##Aegis##)<BR>
Generation Cost: </B>10<B>   Experience Cost: </B>50<BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>2d6+Will vs TN 24/ 1 round to activate; 4 rounds/ 2 minutes <BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Blurring the line between warm flesh and cold stone is Aegis.  By bringing just enough of their body into a flexible stone, the Gargoyle is able to become a rather formidable opponent to harm physically.  Bladed weapons seem to bounce harmlessly to the side, hand to hand attacks feel as if they dealt as much damage to the attacker as they did to the Gargoyle.  Any bladed/piercing weapon that strikes while Aegis is activated deals no damage at all, and will become instantly dulled, until resharpened.  Successful hand to hand attacks against the Gargoyle deal their full damage, but the attacker suffers 1 Body damage from the strike as a result of high velocity impact with the stone form.  Bullets are not affected by Aegis in any manner.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Charade- 1 soul to use. (##Charade##) </B><BR>
<B>Generation cost:</B> 5 <B>Experience cost:</B> 25<BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B>2d6+Body vs. TN 12<BR>
<B>Effect/Duration:</B> Charade allows the Gargoyle to take a temporary roost during the night. Usually this skill is used when the Gargoyle is unsettled by something and does not wish to risk an altercation. While in this form, the gargoyle does not heal at all like it would in it's Perched position. If caught in this position during the daylight the Gargoyle does not take damage as it is in a stone form, but also does not heal until it can obtain it's original perch the following day. While in this form mental and identification masteries are nulled.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Earth Walk</I>  </B>-<B>1 Soul per use.   (##StoneSwim##)<I><BR>
</I>Generation Cost: </B>10  <B>Experience Cost: </B>50 <BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  2d6 + Will vs TN 24/ Scene; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Gargoyles are historically born of stone and rock, and share a certain special bond with all stone that can manifest in different ways.  When a gargoyle touches any stone or stony surface (marble or granite floor or walls, cement or concrete sidewalks, etc.) and successfully makes the roll for this Mastery, they can alter the composition of their body so as to move insubstantially through the stone as if they were swimming through water.  While phased into the stone, they cannot be hurt by any physical attack that does not first go through the stone to reach them (bullets, for example, are unlikely to penetrate 3' of basalt, while high explosives are rather more likely to demolish the stone they are encased in).  Speed of movement is at the same rate as normal swimming; i.e., faster than a walk but slower than running or flying.  Gargoyles cannot bring anyone else into the stone with them, nor any items other than the clothes on their back.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Monolith - 1 Soul to use. (##Monolith##)</B><BR>
<B>Generation Cost:</B> 5 <B>Experience Cost:</B> 25<BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B>2d6+Body vs. TN 16/ 1 round to activate; scene.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Being a stone creature does have advantages, most are rather obvious.  Monolith is one of these "obvious" advantages. By becoming one with the the ground, in essence tying itself to the earth, the Gargoyle is immovable.  No force can remove the Gargoyle from the ground until the duration has expired, or the Gargoyle ends this mastery voluntarily.  It is important to note that the Gargoyle does -not- become heavier, or gain mass.  <BR>
Instead, they simply become a part of the scenery, of the earth.  The old adage, "If Mohammed cannot go to the mountain, the mountain will come to Mohhamed" no longer holds true.<BR>
<B><I><BR>
Sandstone</I> - 1 Soul to use. (##Sandstone##)</B><BR>
<B>Generation Cost: </B>10  <B>Experience Cost:</B> 50<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> 2d6+Body vs TN 18/  1 round to activate; 3 round duration/ one and a half minutes<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Creatures of stone themselves, Gargoyles have learned how to effectively manipulate their bodies even to the point of almost dissolving themselves into particles, enter Sandstone. Sandstone allows the Gargoyle to dissolve a fine layer of their body into sand like particles, adding this effect with a furious gust of wind from their wings and this begins to form a thick irritating cloud of dust.  The round after performing the mastery, a -2 is given to all attacks to all combatants. Once the cloud has reached the second round, Sandtone has reached it's peak and a -4 is issued to all attacks in the area of effect. In the third round, the Gargoyle has removed as much skin as possible without risk of body damage, and a -2 to all attacks is issued.  Sandstone affects any and all characters within the 40 foot diameter radius.  Aiming cannot be accomplished by anyone within the sand cloud, nor can any within the cloud be the target of an aimed attack.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Sand Blast (Sandstone required) -1 soul to use. (##Sand Blast## )</B> <BR>
<B>Generation cost: </B>10 <B>Experience Cost: </B>50<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> 2d6+Body vs TN 18; 4 rounds/ 2 minutes<BR>
<B>Effect/Duration: </B> By shifting a slight amount of outer stone into a sand-like substance, the  gargoyle can cause great amounts of pain and trouble to objects and people around him/her.  The gargoyle flaps their wings rapidly, sending forth bursts of stinging sand out from his/her body, striking any and all things in a 50 foot area.  This sand is so fast moving that it will peel paint off of objects and erode softer stone structures, much in the same way as sandblasting works.  Any creature caught in this area must make a Body roll vs TN 14 or be blinded for 2 rounds.  In addition, those that are unlucky enough to remain in the area of effect for more than one round suffer 1 Body damage for every round that they are struck by the sand.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sentinel (Charade required) - 1 soul to use. (##Sentinal##)</B><BR>
<B>Generation Cost:</B> 10 <B>Experience Cost: </B>50<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> 2d6+Will vs. TN 22/ 1 round to activate; scene.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>While the Gargoyle rests, or is in the Charade form, he/she is effectively helpless to their surroundings.  They know of nothing that goes on around them because they are true stone.  Sentinel gives the Gargoyles a defense mechanism.  Once activated, this mastery lasts the entire duration of the Gargoyle's sleep cycle, or Charade.  If the Gargoyle's body is touched or damaged in any way, they will immediately become aware of the action against them.  Should they feel that their life is in peril, they may choose to end their sleep, or come out of Charade instantly. While in Sentinel the gargoyle's spirit taps into the physical plane with only the sense of limited hearing and pure physical touch. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>Shed</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 1 Soul to use.  (##Shed##)<BR>
Generation Cost: </B>10<B>   Experience Cost: </B>50<BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>2d6+Will vs TN 24/ 1 round to activate; 30 minutes <BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When a Gargoyle's existence has become threatened to the point of near destruction, only one thing remains to save him.  By retreating into their base form, their most natural state of being, a Gargoyle has vast recuperative powers.  Upon activation of Shed, the Gargoyle's body stiffens rapidly, until it has become completely stone.  Within this rocky cocoon, the Gargoyle's body begins to heal the wounds that have forced this mastery's use.  Once the thirty minute period has elapsed, the Gargoyle bursts free from the hard coating, refreshed and healed.<BR>
     Should the Gargoyle be attacked while in this state, whatever damage that actually manages to hurt the stone form will be added onto the Body loss.  In the unlikely event that the Gargoyle will be forced below 0 Body while healing, at the mastery's duration, the Gargoyle will emerge with 1 Body.  If the body is destroyed in some manner, the Gargoyle will be considered "dead" until such time that their natural regenerative powers can bring them back to a Body of 1.<BR>
     The base Body damage that is healed is 2 points for hitting the TN of 26.  For every two points over 26 the Gargoyle rolls, another 1 point of Body will be restored.  Rolling double 6's -only- adds twelve to the total, there is no automatic success for this mastery.<BR>
<B><I><BR>
</I>Spiritual Vision - 1 soul to use. (##Vision##)</B><BR>
<B>Generation Cost:</B> 20 <B>Experience Cost:</B> 100<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>2d6+Will vs. TN 24/ 1 round to activate; scene.<BR>
<B>Effect/Duration:</B>  The duality of a Gargoyle is best seen in the use of Spiritual Vision.  By tapping into the spiritual plane, the Gargoyle is able to penetrate illusions, veils of shadows, etc.  What this means is simple: You cannot hide your spirit from the sight of a Gargoyle.  Once activated, every living being will show as a faintly glowing figure.  Hiding behind objects will keep a living creature from being spotted by the Gargoyle until either side moves and removes the object from line of sight.  Due to the fact that vampires are widely believed to not have souls, this mastery cannot detect the presence of a vampire. (As a dual action mastery, the different colors of light that a gargoyle sees while in this state represent the breed. Ex. Purple=Lamia, White=Angel ect., A gargoyle would not be able to diversify the meaning of the shades unless appropriate lore was made available. Vampires cannot be identified through the use of this mastery.)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>Wing's Edge </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 1 Soul to use.  (##WingEdge##)<BR>
Generation Cost: </B>15<B>   Experience Cost: </B>75<BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>2d6+Body vs TN 18/ 1 round to activate;4 rounds/ 2 minutes<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Gifted with bodies of both stone and flesh, Gargoyle's have learned to tap into this unique state of being, and know how to use it to their advantage.  By shifting the leading edge of their wings into stone, then drawing them taut, the Gargoyle causes a razor sharp membrane of rock to form. This ability, like so many things, is a two edged sword.  While it is capable of causing great damage, it also hinders the Gargoyle's ability to fly and maneuver in the air.  The wings themselves will inflict 2 points of Body damage per hit, if nothing more than a Base Attack roll is used.  If Natural Weaponry is used in combination with Wing's Edge, each strike will do 3 points of Body damage.  The downside of Wing's Edge is that is severely hampers flight, to the point that should the Gargoyle be forced to make any sort of defensive rolls while flying, they will have a -4 penalty.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Hailstone</I> (Monolith required) - 2 Soul to use. (##Hailstone##)</B><BR>
<B>Generation Cost:</B>20  <B>Experience Cost:</B>100<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> 2d6+body vs. TN 16 to initialize, 2d6+body vs. 2d6+body to attack; 1 round to activate/scene.<BR>
<B>Effects/Description:</B> Hailstone is a powerful example of the Gargoyle's pure physical domination over those who oppose. Hailstone requires the gargoyle take flight upon a designated altitude, and drop towards it's target with the weight of a crushing boulder. Upon impact the target receives a -4 to body as the Gargoyle is at a loss of -1 body. Once landing upon the intended, physical movement is all but stopped for both parties, no physical attacks may be made by the target nor the user. This mastery is only broken upon the users loss of conscience or the release of the mastery upon his own will. If the mastery is unable to connect the user will remain in a state of shock for two remaining rounds at a -5 for all rolls.<BR>
