</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0">(Random thoughts in the direction of the breed. As most the time with most my thoughts, some of this is at random..so bear with me...it's just best I write this out.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gargoyles: Clandestine in nature. Winged creatures in their true form, usually with horrific tortured faces, some even of mythic animals. (Size will be limited, for RP standards and fairness...no stone dragons..sorry. All other characteristics will be left to the creator, with certain things left up to common sense.) <BR>
<BR>
History: Gargoyles as they first appeared were nothing more than decorative water spouts. Their grotesque appearance lead many to believe that they were to ward off evil spirits from the building they adorned..after the middle ages architects who wanted to keep a buildings gothic integrity used gargoyles as nothing more that a decoration serving no real purpose at all.<BR>
<BR>
BB History: (Rough Draft outline.) Our gargoyles will be nothing but stone monoliths that not only warded off evil (Good to I suppose.) spirits..but even housed some. For the purpose of the game we wanted to indirectly tie them into the Lamia breed..I proposed with the approval of Jason that we some how include necromancy into this. Perhaps having the would be necromancer being a little nervous of the formerly alive spirits he sent to the other side, he used his Gargoyles as spiritual dream catchers. (Dream catchers are a decroative loop and web construction thought to hold bad dreams untill the sun came and melted them in it's rays.) However, necromancy being a mystical art, it not only caught the spirits it was meant to imprison but gave them a new host to control. <BR>
<BR>
Direction: As stated above I would love to bring out the two selections of this breed..the stone body and the spirits manipulation of it. I believe with the advent of a former living embodiment would add the much needed RP requirment for this breed. On the earlier attempt of this breed I found the elemental aspects that were being used brought down a breed that could survive well with what it had already. Looking like a pokemon character is not what this game needs..so in that, the Gaia..mother earth direction was dropped like a two ton brick. <BR>
<BR>
 Some aspects that I did like however was a third party faction to the good and bad category. I liked the thought of a breed designed to want to be the enemies of either Angels or Demons...but how would we accomplish that...simple in this case, I would conclude that the spirits housed in the stone structures have become paranoid, actually enjoying their return to the earthly realm and wishing no part in either sides battle...your hippies of the spiritual world I suppose..but more aggresive.<BR>
<BR>
 Body wise in the game I want the player to have as much control over the look of the trueform as possible, just as an architect would having making one. That being said I would require common sense to be an outstanding goal. Human like contsructions I would estimate no larger than ten to twelve feet, animal structures no bigger than a polar bear (Largest land mammal, which when standing on hind legs can raise to about twelve feet.) I wish the player to keep in mind that the spirits new found bodies were originally attended for a roost atop a building..so construction wise it should fit in that environment.<BR>
<BR>
Well that's about it so far...thus concludes my rough draft summary of the Gargoyle breed.<BR>
