</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	A Schicksal is, in reality, the personification of Death. Neither an angelic nor  demonic force, their primary job is to reave the souls of the dead from their bodies and escort those souls to the light or the dark, wherever the Minion that leads them chooses.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>	The Schicksal are those who have been chosen by the restless spirits, because of some affront to the a restless spirit, to spend their eternity in the dead's service, laying to rest those who deserve it so... <BR>

Not every affront causes this reaction, few things are horrible enough to justify the punishment, and few souls have not been laid to rest by a Schicksal, as only restless souls may cause the change. When the mortal is cursed, he is drawn inexhorably to the grave of the insulted spirits by unstoppable forces within a week. If the person died and was not buried he will be drawn to the place where their body lies. There, all will seem to go dark for the Schicksal-to-be, as a bluish aura  surrounds him. The victim will disappear for three days, caught in the realm of the rested dead, where it will be educated by the dead themselves. On the third day, the Schicksal to be must roll 2d6 + Soul vs. TN 14 to escape the void, forsaking the temptation of eternal slumber.<BR>

(See lore level 3 below for details). However, there is a way to seriously injure one. Fire will cause two points of body damage for every round the Schicksal is exposed to it. These wounds are not deadly to a Schicksal, however they can cause serious damage as they cannot be healed normally.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about angels.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.<BR>

Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You believe that a Schicksal comes in one form, the Grim Reaper of souls  You  may believe they are symbolic in their presence and so not exist. The Schicksal chooses when to take you with its sharp scythe and<BR>
deadly touch, and escaping it is impossible.<BR>

<B>Cat Fur</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Cat fur has been, since ancient times, regarded as a bane of death. The egyptians used cat fur to ward off the undead.  The fur itself, however, has absolutely no power since it lacks a whole cat.  It is the faith of the wielder that empowers the fur.  Holding the fur aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the fur and<BR>
the Schicksal they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the Schicksal's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the Schicksal's roll, they are successful.  The angel must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the angel from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the Schicksal may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the Schicksal will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the Schicksal is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes. The failed use of cat fur will only serve to enrage the Schicksal, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able, even if it is normally against their nature to do so. It is not possible for one Schicksal to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>

You know that the destructive nature of fire can burn and seriously<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>injure The Schicksal. You know that The Schicksal can take many forms, ranging from reapers to any shape representing death. You also "know" that a Schicksal cannot effect you while you are holding an object of faith.  When a Schicksal uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your<BR>

If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

<B>Crysanthemum Ashes</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>Crysanthemums are a symbol of death and the dead to most in the world. To others, it is a way to injure supernatural beings.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough ash for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character may hold the ash in a container of its<BR>
choice. To attack with the ash, the character must roll 2d6 + Attack vs. the Schicksal's 2d6 + Quickness, as it is difficult to dodge a cloud of deadly dust.  Only 3 attacks worth of Ash may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered Ash may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the ash is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This<BR>
roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  If an attack is successful, the Schicksal suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The Schicksal must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Schicksal heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

You have finally discovered the truth about them.  You also know all that is truth, their creation and their mission. Having studied The Schicksal for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a Schicksal uses a mental mastery with<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Schicksal by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing one of the true forms of the Schicksal, Horseman, Reaper or Valkyrie. If you wish to<BR>
identify the TF as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Schicksal, and not some illusion, a fearful hallucination.  The second method is by observing the Schicksal transform either to or from one of its TFs.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Schicksal.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Requiem</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>The Schicksal, when it returns from its "training",  is altered slightly, in that its soul cannot be reaved by any normal means. No matter how much physical punishment the body absorbs, the soul that had laid to rest so many of its own has a natural resistance to befalling the same fate. Yet there is a way to free a Schicksal's soul from its body. The body must first be brought to the negative equivalent of its body stat. Once this is achieved, the killer must play a requiem, a song of mourning for the soul. This can be done with either the voice or with any instrument. The attacker will then make a faith roll of 2d6 + soul + faith vs. TN 26. If he succeeds, the next round the The Schicksal's Immortal Soul is lulled into rest for one round. At this point, the killer may, for that round only, kill the Schicksal with any attack. The Schicksal will appear mortal after its death.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
1) Cats are a living bane to the forces of death. A symbol of life, since ancient times they have been known for warding death. A Schicksal cannot stand their presence, and will, upon sight, either kill the offending feline or leave the place they are in. If they are unable to do so, the conflict within their body will cause them to decay over the next hour into a corpse, taking a -5 to all physical and will rolls as a result.<BR>
 <BR>
2) A Schicksal's calling is the not comforting of souls. However, there is one exception. The restless soul that was offended in their creation forever demands service, the Schicksal's eternal curse. At least once a day the Schicksal must visit the site where it committed its offense to help ease the pain of the controlling wraith.<BR>
<BR>
3) A Schicksal's calling <I>is</I> the laying to rest of souls. When a Schicksal comes across a dead body, it must lay that soul to rest unless: it either has already been or that soul is the one who created another Schicksal. It needn't immediately preform the ceremony of its choice (which must be preformed in a TF), but it cannot leave until then. All places of many deaths (graveyards, shipwrecks) are assumed to contain unrested souls. (If there are multiple<BR>
souls in the area it need only rest one to relieve itself sufficiently to leave)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Effect/Description:</B> The Schicksal have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to a Schicksal will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by Chrysanthemums cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.

It stands as tall as its mortal shell, an inky blackness covered in a black or dark blue cloak. Its face is skeletal, with glowing red eyes.

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>Effect/Description: </B>When a mortal (werewolf, lamia, et al) dies, the The Schicksal are the ones who provide the final blow, actually reaving the soul from the dead body. From this experience, some few of the most powerful The Schicksal have learned to reave the souls of those they kill prematurely. The successful activation of this mastery prevents any major medical roll from being preformed on a victim to revive them from death, leaving only a miracle to save them. Also, assuming the Schicksal has lore 3 in a breed and knows its victim is of that breed, it may make the above roll rather than make a faith roll. This mastery may only be initiated in a true form, and may only be activated when a victim is in or past the mortal requirements for death.<B><BR>

System/Duration:</B> 2d6 + Will vs. TN 20; Scene; Takes 2 rounds to activate<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>A minion can learn, through patient practice, that mortals are not the only creatures that can be manipulated to increase the population of the dead. Through intense concentration, a Minion may learn to summon native beasts to attack a victim. Like a raging horus, the animal will not stop until its victim is killed or it is knocked out. If a PC character is in the form of the animal chosen to be summoned, it must roll 2d6 + Will vs. the Schicksal's roll to not be the creature called to the Schicksal. No more than two creatures may be summoned at one time, and the creatures must be within sight and able to access their victim. The animal will have a soul and mind of 3, with the body stat and quickness bonus given for the lamia form. <BR>

<B>Experience Cost: </B>Innate<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> NA/Scene; Takes one round to shapeshift<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Effect/Description:</B> The forms of death are infinite. However, only the Minions have learned to actually create these forms, to shape themselves with the essence of death. This form is chosen (And must be approved) when the Schicksal becomes a minion. It most often duplicates The Schicksal's personality. A highly religious Schicksal may choose its rendition of an angel of death, whereas a violent, angry Schicksal might choose a demonic, horrific form. However,  most minions are loathe to use this form as it is overuse of a form that allows lower echelons of The Schicksal to take Minion forms for their own. While in this most natural of forms the minion will gain a bonus of +2 Body +2 Soul <BR>

<B>Entropy -3 Soul to Use (##Entropy <Object>##)</B><BR>
<B>Experience Cost:</B> 100 xp<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> See Below / 1 Hour; Takes 1 Round to Activate<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The Minions of Death sometimes learn to gain almost universal power. By focusing their wills and drawing upon the chaotic forces that cause death, they can force an object to temporarily break down into pure energy. The object will flash brilliantly for a moment, causing a -2 to all attack rolls of every sighted person in the area, with or without eye protection. Anyone holding the object will take one point of fire damage due to the immense heat. To succeed in the mastery, a Schicksal must roll 2d6  + Will vs a TN 18 + 2 for every ten pounds. Thus an object of 10 pounds(rounded up) will take a TN of 20, an object of 5 pounds will take a TN of 18, and an Object of 33 pounds would require a TN of 26.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

They slink through the shadows, and, when your time is up, no force on earth can prevent them from coming to get you. They hold alleigance to neither the dark or the light, only to their own leaders.  A Schicksal is a spiritual force that will join itself with that of a mortal as a curse, to avenge a truly horrific act preformed against an unrested soul.<BR>
