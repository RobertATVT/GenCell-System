<BR>
There are those who say that Death is but merely a stepping stone to the next life. There are those who believe that when you die, you go on to your eternal reward with no break in between. For the most part, they are both right. And they are both wrong. Death is indeed the beginning for some -- the beginning of their Quest. These are those few souls who, at the time of death, are ripped from their sojourn to their final resting place by a driving need. Some are drawn back for revenge, others for penance, and still others for reasons that no one knows but themselves. These lost souls are rejoined with their earthly bodies, and rise again as morbid charactiures of their former selves. They cannot return to their rest until they complete their appointed Quest, and woe be those who stand in their way. These are the brotherhood of the dark -- these are the Revenants.<BR>
<BR>
Revenants are a type of ghost, just more dangerous. They are condemned by their Quest to walk the world of the living, forever outside it, knowing that they will never truly be a part of it again. Thanks to this, Revenants are not social creatures. They do not seek each other out for company, and will likely not make many friends. They prefer the solitude of their sanctuary and the fellowship of the shadows. That is not to say they do not develop friendships, or even in rare cases love, but the all-consuming obsession with the Quest puts an enormous strain on any long term relationship.<BR>
<BR>
They are not immaterial as classical ghosts are thought to be. Their flesh and bone bodies are more resilient than any Mortals, and are designed to take abuse. This is because they are fueled not by food, but by a spirit whose passion for life, for whatever reason, was stronger than the cold hand of death.  A Revenant does not need to eat, sleep or breathe -- even though they can mimic all three when the situation calls for it. They do, however, need a Touchstone -- the very something that acts as a link between the land of the living and the hereafter. This Touchstone can be anything from a childhood toy, to a favored place or even a person.<BR>
<BR>
These Touchstones are vital to the Revenant's survival. Often they are items that were significant in their life, although it may be something related to his or her Quest, or simply something that was close to their heart. If the Touchstone is destroyed at the same time as the Revernant's body is killed, the Revenant loses their grasp on life and is doomed to wander as a real Ghost. The Revenant is consigned to an eternity of endless, bodiless haunting -- never to fulfil their Quest.  <BR>
<BR>
Every Revenant is on a Quest -- this Quest is the central motivation in their existence. A Revenant must complete his or her Quest to finish their journey into eternity. This Quest is a mission that cannot be forgotten or denied, although it can be put aside if other more pressing needs intervene. However, a Revenant is magically compelled to ever continue the Quest and see it to completion. (see below.) For some the Quest is to protect a certain individual or family; for others it is to guard a secret; still others to make amends for wrongs done in life. Of course, there is always revenge, denied love and other more emotional Quests. The Quest is something that cannot be completed in one night or even in several . . . it is a long term goal. The Quest must be stated in the Revenant's Background and be Approved.  <BR>
<BR>
If a Revenant strays too long from his or her Quest (more than two weeks) they feel an increasing pain, confusion and they begin to lose Body at the rate of -1 point per night until they "die" and are doomed to roam the earth bodiless. This damage cannot be healed overnight -- it will only heal as significant steps are taken to complete the Quest. When that happens, the damage will heal at 1 Body per day.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Becoming:  </B>A Revenant can be generated, but cannot make more of their own kind. Not that they would anyhow. Only the Mortal Breeds (Mortal, Psychic and Lamia) can Breed Change to a Revenant, and only if they meet the requirements. No character dying from any Lore/Faith rolls will be allowed to Breed Change to the Revenant Breed. This Breed is for either newly created characters or recently killed characters with a distinct mission or Quest in mind. To generate a Revenant, wether Generated or Breed Changed, you must create a Background that contains the story of the Revenant-to-be's Quest. For a Breed Change this can be the story of the characters death, and why they are coming back as a Revenant. Upon Approval, you may create a Revenant character. If the Background for a Breed Change is -not- Approved, the character remains dead.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mortality:  </B>Dead Mortal with regenerative abilities (Revenant Lore level 3 is required to kill a member of this Breed).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Means of Death:</B>   A Revenant can only be killed entirely if the body of the Revenant is brought down to negative their Body stat and their Touchstone is destroyed. (See Revenant Lore level 3) Other than that, little slows them down. They can be damaged as normal, and they can be seroiusly damaged by Blood Water. Fire, on the other hand, has little to no effect on Revenants. Wounds created by fire are healed normally, as Revenants have no fear of fire. See Healing below for more details.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Please note: If you have the following level of Lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Revenants.  Some are fact and some are myth. If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.</I><BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Lore Level 1</I>:</B> You have watched one too many horror movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue. You may believe that Revenants are evil, carriers of the Dark or just Ghosts.  You may believe they are horrid creatures which haunt abandoned houses or come out on Halloween night. Maybe you think their shadowy nature makes them hate the light.   The image of walking white sheets, Poltergiest or transparent figures are some of the things that might be believed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Shadow Scent: </B>This<B> </B>strong scent that is an unusual mixture of holy water, Ginger root and a lock of hair from the recently deceased. Under normal conditions this scent is overwhelming to Revenants, but they tolerate it as they do most everything else. It serves to remind them of the hereafter, where they should be. However, their Quest here on Earth enables them to defy it -- until the proper Faith is put behind it. Then the scent becomes repulsive. Waving the Scent about, like inscence, the character must concentrate, focusing their Faith on the mixture and the Revenant they are attempting to ward off. This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the Revenant's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the Revenant's roll, they are successful. The Revenant must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes. Nothing will dissuade them from fleeing until the duration wears off. This is a blind panic and the only actions the Revenant may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, they will attempt to attack the closest person, figuring they are the ones with the offensive scent. If the Revenant is successful in beating away their target, they may ignore the effects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character (who warded them originally, not the target of their ire.) for 4 rounds / 2 minutes. If the Revenant wins the roll, the failed use of Shadow Scent will only serve to enrage the Revenant, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able. It is not possible for a Revenant to use this warding method on another of their own kind.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Lore Level 2</I>:<I> </B></I>You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of Revenants. Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false. You know that Revenants are immune to fire, but blood can damage them if properly mixed. You've learned that even Revenants have limits, and cling to life instead of accepting their death. Certain physical aspects can now be picked up when viewing Revenants. When an Revenant uses a mental Mastery with you as the target, within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. aTN: 20. It matters not if you know the characters Breed -- your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process. If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that Mastery. (Defense is only good against Masteries requiring the Revenant to use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; it cannot be used while in direct combat with the Revenant).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Blood Water: </B>Blood water is the mixture of blood from the recently dead and holy water, a disgusting mess at best. The faith put behind this concoction is what harms the Revenant, for it is said that the blood reminds them of death -- which they want but cannot have since their Quest dooms them to walk the Earth -- but the holy water reminds them of what they have lost. The mixture, when properly empowered, poses a danger to the Revenant. It takes 10 minutes to empower enough for 1 attack. This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work. The character must put the Blood Water in whatever item they intend to attack the Revenant with prior to the empowering. These objects can be any small item that can hold water, such as balloons, tiny vials, squirt guns, etc. Only 3 attacks worth of Blood Water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability. The empowered Blood Water may only be used by the individual that created it. The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22. This roll must be witnessed and approved by either a room Host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the Revenant are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill. If an attack is successful, the Revenant suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally. The Revenant must heal the damage as any normal Mortal would.  <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Lore Level 3</I>:</B> You have studied Revenants most of your life, for some odd reason, and perhaps you've even known a few. Youhave discovered the truth about their Quests, and their deeper secrets. Having studied the Revenant for so long, you've begun to pick up some of their ways and might even be able to recognize some of their habits. When an Revenant uses a mental Mastery with you as the target, within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20. It matters not if you know the characters Breed -- your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process. If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you aone time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that Mastery. (Defense is only good against Masteries requiring the Revenant to use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; it cannot be used while in direct combat with the Revenant).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sight Recognition: </B>There are two methods of identifying an Revenants by sight. Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the Breed. Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible. The first is by physically seeing the True Form, or <I><???></I>, of the Revenant. If you wish to identify the <???> as a Breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14. If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a <???><I>,</I>and not some illusion of the eyes. The second method is by observing the Revenant transform either to, or from, <???><I>.</I> If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a legendary Revenant. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Touchstone Destruction:  </B>To kill a Revenant, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their Body statistic.  A Body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, the Revenant will be unconscious until the following night until the touchstone is destroyed.  When a Revenant is taken down to the negative total of their body statistic, the image of the touch stone is expelled in the shadows to the attacker, making it possible for the attacker to find the touchstone to destroy it.  Touchstones are never far from the Revenant, the need to be close to it allows it to be easily located once the image is expelled. Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must spend a full round of uninterrupted concentration as they summon their faith, focusing it on the Revenant.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for hitting the prone Revenant.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the touchstone image will be given and the attacker must destroy it.   Once the image is expelled it will remain clear to the attacker where the touchstone is and how to destroy it.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the time needed to complete the task.  No character may attempt to expell the image more than one time an hour.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mandatory Role-play Requirements<I><BR>
</I>1) </B>The character must exhibit a certain amount of unconfortabless in areas where there are a lot of people.  The urge to move away or be by themselves is great.  When in these situations, they become irritated.                              <BR>
<B>2) </B> Even though Revenant's can walk in the light of day and the dark of night, they prefer the night.  <BR>
<B>3)</B> Losing the touchstone is a devasting situation for the Revenant.  They will do whatever it takes to find it or locate it, up to killing another person in possession of it.<BR>
<B>5) </B>The Quest is first and foremost in their minds.  Everything else is secondary. Relationships do not last long and do not hold satisfaction to them as usually the other partner does not understand their incessant need to follow their task.<BR>
<B>6) </B>Revenants need to eat, sleep and take care of themselves to keep up their mortal shell.  They can get drunk from alcohol and the affect makes them quite nasty to deal with.<BR>
<B>7) </B>Unlike most Breeds, that have no telepathy, nor can they be affected by it.  They simply don't hear anyone attempting to mindspeak to them.  Hypnotic Suggestion and Obsession has no affect on the Revenant.<BR>
<B>8)</B>     The Revenant has no memories of their past life but certain things can trigger a response that the Revenant may not know why they are responding to.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:  </B>Since the Revenant comes with no memories of the past. Certain things could trigger a response.

<B>Duration/Activation:</B>  2 rounds, one round to activate<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>It is said that the direct stare of a Revenant is like looking into the eyes of death itself.  This paralyzing gaze is the result of their intimacy with death.  If the Revenant is successful then the victim is paralyzed with fear for the duration.  No movement can be made by the victim, they are rooted to the spot out of actual fear.  They cannot make any attempts at attacking or use any masteries.  Once the effect is over they will remember the gaze and avoid it at all costs.

<B>Effect/Description: </B>The Revenant is a creature attuned to pain even to the point where physical pain will not hinder its quest, but in fact fuel it.  The sensation of physical pain in combat will allow the Revenant to absorb the points of damage before incurring any damage from attacks.  This effect will last the duration.  Because of the concentration that this creates, the Revenant will be unable to use any mind masteries while this is being used.<BR>
