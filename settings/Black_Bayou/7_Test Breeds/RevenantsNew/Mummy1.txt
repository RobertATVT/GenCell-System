	The Ancient Egyptians had an obsession with death, and the afterlife. Many of the most powerful feared they would spend their eternity's forgotten, or alone. Great magicians were trained to learn the methods of binding the spirits in an everlasting cycle of rebirth, thus cheating the God Apophis -- Devourer of the Dead. They were successful, and it was during these times that the Mummy was born.  <BR>
<BR>
	In those days the Pharaohs ruled over men and built vast and wondrous structures that have lasted thousands of years. Tombs of grandeur to house their eternal bodies as they lived on. Priests, Viziers and magicians of all sorts strove to be the ones that were chosen to have the Rites performed upon.  Many were -- some are still here, walking among mankind as we speak. The children of Ra are forever and as immortal as the Sun God himself, and shall never perish.<BR>
<BR>
	Of course, not all attempts to cheat death were successful. Special Rites were needed, above and beyond the complex funerary rituals that were used for normal mummification. Even then, it didn't always work.  Although most men and women who were taken through the Rites had the drive or ambition for eternity, most didn't have the spirit to become immortal. They and the rest of the common mummies now sit in dusty museums as freak shows for the masses, on display like ancient pottery . . . and surely they weep in the Underworld at their failure.<BR>

The creation of a Mummy is a long and arduous process, not lightly undertaken by anyone. It is hideously painful, and often fatal. First, the victim's body must be completely washed and the Special Rite uttered over it. Tiny tattoos are drawn on the body by the Master, and prayers to the Gods are inscribed therein. These combine to help the victim survive the final stages. Next, the victims internal organs are removed while the complex rituals from the <I>Book of the Dead</I> are chanted. This allows the Mummy to remove any hopes of frailty such as those their Mortal cousins possess. Unfortunately, it's a mindbendingly horrific procedure made possible only by the special Rites. Still, the victim must successfully roll 2d6+Will vs. TN: 20 to survive it.  If the victim fails, the Master has failed to properly inscribe a tattoo, or mispronounced a word, and the victim dies an agonizing death.  Once the organs are removed they must be placed in properly made Canoptic Jars to hold them safely and protect them from all harm. This allows the Mummy to cheat death and avoid Apophis's vengeance. It is vital to remove any and all moisture from them, thus allowing the bodies to avoid the ravages of time and rot. Second, the Master wraps the victim's body in linen wrappings, again inscribing them with prayers and sigils while chanting the complex rituals from the <I>Book of the Dead</I>. This allows the body to hold all nine parts of the body and soul in one place, specifically the Khu and Sekhem, which are the soul and spirit respectively. Binding these forces in place requires the Master to make a successful roll of 2d6+Will vs.TN: 24. If the Master fails this roll, the victim's Ba inhabits the body. The Ba is the part of the soul that visits "hell", and thus is tainted by the Dark. Combined with the other parts of the body and soul it is merely a balancing force, but once it's in the victims body, alone, the victim becomes an insane monster that must be destroyed by the Master lest it wreak vengeance across the land. If the roll is successful, though, the body must lie in state over the next few days or weeks while the magic's work their way through the victim's body and soul. On the night of the next new moon, the victim will unexpectedly fly into its Khat form for the first time, and will immediately begin a search for its Master. Upon finding him or her, the Master must smack down the new Mummy to bring about the final change.    <BR>

Regular fire will cause 3 points of damage per round they are exposed to it.  Fire wounds can be deadly, but can also cause serious damage since they take twice as long to heal normally.

Any wound caused to the Mummy body will heal at the rate of 2 Body per hour the character rests. This healing rate cannot be accelerated by any means and use of medical skills is useless on this breed since they have no internal organs to work with. The advantages of innate healing are counterbalanced by the fact that they may *never* receive any sort of medical attention and cannot receive any sort of external healing ( Mending, Gift of Life, Accelerated Healing, etc...) If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over. A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body points back. Wounds created by Grave Dust cannot be healed with this mastery. Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps. If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed). The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.

Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue. You believe that a Mummy is only found in Egypt, and is a shambling mass of undead rags. You may believe they are fiction, and may not truly exist in the physical world at all. Some will even believe the mummy in the local museum is actually sleeping, just waiting to rise and wreak vengeance on those who disturbed its tomb. Not on *you*, though. If they did appear, you might assume they'd be large man-shaped creatures wrapped in dirt and exposed bone. For example -- a Mummy is never seen without its golden deathmask, or Egyptian jewelry adorning its body, symbolizing all that is ancient about these creatures. <BR>

This has special power that most have no idea of, you on the other hand know it's original purpose. The Banishing Sign was used to ward of curses and the undead through Ancient Egypt's past, and this affects Mummy's more than most. The character opposing the Mummy must hold an Ankh up in one hand and inscribe the Banishing Sign in the air while focusing his faith through this sign. For the entire duration of the warding the character must hold his Ankh aloft. This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the Mummies 2d6+Soul+Faith. If the character beats the Mummy's roll they are successful and the Mummy must flee the scene for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes, and nothing will dissuade the Mummy from fleeing until the duration wears off. This is a blind panic and the only actions that the Mummy may make are those that will allow them to escape quicker. Should there be no place to run, the Mummy will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear. If this attempt fails however, the Mummy can ignore any further warding attempts by the same character for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes. The failed use of warding also enrages the Mummy and they will attack the character as their next action however they are able.  You may not ward a member of your own Breed.<BR>

Whether they were made to protect a tomb or to forever research something, they are back and eternal. The one thing that truly affects them is the presence of death -- this is symbolized by Grave Dust.  Any dust from a crypt or tomb, or finely prepared soil from a grave, is properly prepared and charged with faith it's effects on a Mummy can be devastating. It takes 10 minutes to empower a single handful of dust that can be used for 1 attack. This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work. The character must chant the preparation rite in the native tongue (Egyptian) and then whatever material is held will turn into a fine gray powder. The roll to empower the Dust is 2d6 +Soul +Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved by either a room host, ST or GM. To attack with the Dust, the attacker must make a normal hand to hand or throwing attack on the Mummy. Only 3 attacks worth of Grave Dust may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc. The empowered Grave Dust may only be used by the individual that created it. If an attack is successful, the Mummy suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally and will continue to take damage each round until the Mummy can make a 2d6+Soul+Faith roll of 22 to force the dust off their bodies ( Only the naturally high healing rate of the Mummies works, and these wounds heal at a rate of 1 per day).  The Mummy must heal the damage as if it was caused by fire.<BR>

Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study ( and the prerequisite Lore level 3 ) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Mummy, which happens to be the Khat.  If you wish to identify the Mummy as a Breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs.TN 15.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Mummy, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Mummy transform either to or from the Khat.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Mummy. <BR>

A Body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the eternal magic's of the Special Rite. Mummies are creatures of Egyptian lore and there is only one way to take their spirits back to the underworld where they belong.  This is done by using a Scarab sanctified to the God of the Underworld, Anubis.  The person killing the Mummy must place this Scarab on the chest of the fallen mummy and concentrate their faith through it.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 as the faith animates the Scarab.  If the roll is successful the Scarab devours the body and spirit of the Mummy and then vanishes, transporting the lost soul back to the Underworld where it belongs. A ST or GM must be present for this roll to be made otherwise it is invalid. The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if the roll fails it will not kill the Mummy.  No character may attempt to empower a killing item more than once an hour.  There will be no trace of the Mummy after it has died.<BR>

Naturally, the Mummy will go to great lengths to protect and hide these Jars. They will also go to great lengths to retrieve any from those who dare disturb them.

<B>Effect/Description:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B> The Mummy belongs to a culture that believed there were nine distinct parts of the body and soul that had to be accounted for when preparing the corpse for making the trip thru the afterlife. Although this culture died out centuries ago -- as did the Mummy's actual physical body, technically -- the power of that belief lives on in the Khat; ancient Egyptian word for 'body".<BR>
The magic of the Rites that gives the Mummy the ability to live on eternally also gives it the ability to appear normal, usually. However, at times the full horror of the Mummy's existence bursts forth. Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this bandaged corpse is horror incarnate. The skeletal arms and disjointed gait of the Khat hide its awesome speed and skill. Thick, musty rags covers its body as skeletal bonetips rip free on the ends of its fingers. Its eyes gleam and flicker with an unholy light, coming from the head of one of the sacred animals in Egyptian Lore.  These creatures appear like tattered remnants of the Gods themselves, Horus, Anubis, Osiris, Bast, all the gods are reborn in these creatures, back for veangance.  (The player must choose which God they portray at Character or Breed creation). The Khat's reasoning is that of a programmed machine -- unstoppable and bent on fulfilling whatever mission brought it forth in the first place.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>fulfill </I>their mission, be it claim a piece of treasure, capture a person, kill a foe or save a friend.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>fulfill </I>this mission, including killing anyone -- be it loved one or foe -- that gets in the way. Once this mission has been <I>fulfilled</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Mummy reacts depends on who individual it is. Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing. While in Khat form, the Mummy gains +2 Body and +1 Soul. <BR>

Sand, Wind, Flame and Water. A Mummy who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume one of these other forms at will. The innate form must be chosen at character creation. Other forms can be purchased. They can appear in many different shapes and sizes, although their elemental form often takes an appearance similar to their body mass. Their face will become visible if they focus their attention on anyone thru RP. While in elemental form, they gain +1 Body and they may move, albeit erratically, giving them a +4 to Dodge. The Elemental Form is more spiritual than physical, and can not cause damage to anything physically -- it's main purpose if for escape and survival. However, the core of the Elemental Form still exists physically, and can be hit with blunt Attacks, or captured by a well prepared person making a successful Grapple roll.<BR>

While a Mummy is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Mummy will immediately change back to Mortal form minus the total damage it has already taken in its other form. It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shape shift with the character. Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>
