</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Liches are the evil creatures that haunt your dreams.  They are the undead weavers of magick.  Some require incantations while others require old rituals to be performed.  These beings have come about in a dark and sinister way.  No longer are they simple mortal Lamia, but they have evolved beyond that to hold power of a darker and more evil origin.  Study of magick is required of them, but they're powers are granted by the darkness that they served.<BR>
<BR>
You may actually know some of these beings.  However, without the proper Lore, you would have no idea that they were a Lich.  Liches are very elusive beings, since they only arise at night.  They are members of the undead community, just as the Vampires are.  Unlike Vampires, Liches do not have to feed off of the blood of others.  However, they must make a weekly sacrifice to the evil they serve in order to keep their unholy powers.<BR>
<BR>
A Lich appears to be a normal human being; however, there are several distinctive qualities about them.  They are very, very pale.  Since they cannot step into the sunlight, their skin quickly loses most of it's pigmentation.  In general, they look exactly as they did when they were mortal.  The gift or the curse (depending on how the Lich looks at it) locks the individual into the exact same physical appearance they had when they died.  Within the span of a few minutes, any attempted alterations will return to the way they were, prior to the change.  For instance, their hair may not be cut, dyed, or altered in any way (aside from stlye).  This includes any kind of physical change; including tattoos, piercing, etc.  Like Vampires, Liches are empty in the inside of their bodies.  Of course, they still have a heart.  All of their internal systems have stopped working.  They can pretend to eat and breathe, and even experience sexual encounters.  However, a sexual encounter with a Lich wouldn't be very pleasant to the other partner, as Liches are known for their violent mannerisms during sex.<BR>
<BR>
To perform the spells that the Lich possesses, some concentration and thought must be put into it.  Of course some spells may require a certain condition to be present at the time of the casting, but all spell casting requires at least one round of concentration.  At times, the Lich may fail at the spell (bad dice roll, etc..), and any time a Lich fails, they become angered and become determined to master the spell completely.<BR>
<BR>
Rituals, or whatever technique the Lich uses to learn new spells must be posted.  Be creative in this process!!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming:<I>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>Becoming a Lich is not a simple procedure.  First, the mortal wishing to become a member of this breed must seek out a Lamia mentor. After spending a few weeks in training, the mortal must seek out a small pendant, known only as the "Pendant of Wraith".  There are several pendants like this scattered throughout the world.  After securing one of these pendants the mortal must return to his mentor to complete his training.  On the night before his training is complete, the moral must secure for a vampire to sire him.  The next night, the mortal must return to his mentor to complete his training.  As the mix of the magick and the vampiric blood run through his veins, it will create a bond between the two, and the Lich will form.  It will take about two days for the process to be completed.  The Lich will awaken during the night and begin his unlife, serving the darkness that surrounds them.  As a note, the Lich will have no ties with the vampire that sired them.  And he will not be counted as a chylde for the vampire that sired him, nor will he be tied to the Lamia who trained him.  This process will create a Lich that is totally independant, a good way to start a brethren.<BR>
<BR>
There is; however, a simpler process.  Another Lich may bring someone over by presenting him as a sacrifice to the darkness.  Since human sacrifices are a rarity, the darkness will reward the Lich by making the person who was being sacrificed a Lich.  To the Lich that was making the sacrifice, it is a great honor to have this good fortune happen on them.  They will take the newly created Lich and begin to take care of them, and to train them in the ways of the darkness.  This process must be roleplayed and posted.  During the sacrifice, the Lich must roll 2d6+will vs TN of 20 in order to make sure that they don't go beserk and cut the sacrifice into pieces.  Liches who are at least 3 months old may forgo this process if they have a will that is 20 or higher.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  There is only one thing that can truly kill a Lich (see Lore level 3 below for details).  However, there are a couple of ways to seriously injure one.  The rays of the sun will cause a Lich's skin to melt (3 points of body damage for every minute that the Lich is exposed to it).  Fire will cause 2 points of damage per round that the Lich is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to a Lich, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Liches.  Some are fact, some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><I> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> You have watched many horror movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You may believe that Liches are evil, lapdogs of the dark.  You may believe they are evil, dark creatures.  Perhaps you understand the difference between white and black magic.  Thoughts of zombies and voodoo dolls come to mind as well as potions and cauldrons.  According to legend, Liches can't abide the touch of the sunlight.  They work their magic secretly and sometimes almost too obviously.  Liches tend to stick together in Cults, if they aren't off by themselves.  One thing is for sure.  With the right combination of words and ingredients, there is nothing a Lich can't do.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Symbol:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Faith symbols can be any number of items.  Crucifix, Star of David, little golden Buddha, etc.  They must be actual objects, not a pattern sewn into clothing, for instance.  The object itself has absolutely no power whatsoever.  It is the faith of the wielder that empowers the object.  Holding the faith symbol aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the symbol and the lich they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the lich's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the lich's roll, they are successful.  The lich must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the lich from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the lich may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the lich will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the lich is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of a faith symbol will only serve to enrage the lich, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  It is not possible for one lich to use this warding method on another of its kind.  The warder must beware, though.  An enraged Lich may start casting spells at random, not having to chant due to their rage.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of liches.  Having read everything at the local booksellers, to the more arcane legends, you believe you know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false.  You think sunlight seriously injures a lich, as well as fire.  You know which myths from level 1 are, in fact, myths and which are not.  Having studied liches for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a lich uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the lich use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Water:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>Faith water is little more than water empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the lich with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of faith water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the lich are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the vampire suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The lich must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the lich heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 3:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> You have studied Lich most of you life, and perhaps you've even known a few.  You know about ritual upon ritual, even if you may not be able to use them yourself.  You truly understand the reasoning behind each practice of magic that is out there.  More importantly, you understand the real power behind magic, the mind.  Magic is the art of changing consciousness at will.  Meaning, through the power of belief, the Lich can bring about change in the conscious world around you.  Having studied Liches for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a Lich uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the Lich use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Lich by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Lich.  If you wish to identify the Lich as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Lich, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Lich transform either to or from its true form.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Lich.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Pendant of Wraith:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The item that creates the Lich, is also the item that can destroy it.  What creats, must destroy.  It's the natural process of things.  It takes 5 minutes in order to create enough energy in order to destroy the Lich.  However, some precautions must be taken to ensure it's death.  First the Lich must be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, the Lich will be unable to heal itself.  The pendant must be placed upon the heart of the Lich, and after 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration, a roll of 2d6 + Soul + Faith vs TN 26 is required to see if the energy was enough to destroy the Lich.  If successful, the Lich will erupt on fire and will be nothing but ashes after that.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  NA / NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lich can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lich takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.

<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lich is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Lich attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.  The Lich must activate this spell to use it one a certain individual.  Once they have successfully made the roll for that one person, they will not have to roll again.  However, if the Lich decides to go off and chat to another person, another roll is required.  Because the minds are different, if the Lich was to try and reach out to someone they previously MS'd, they must cast the spell again.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Liches have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the lich will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lich needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The target of the prayer is always the darkness they serve, as they are reaching out to them for help in replenishing their dark and mystical energies.  The praying must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the praying must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Lich masteries are what we call spells and incantations.  They represent the ability to focus one's will in such a way as to alter the world around them.  The spells are the powers that they harness from the darkness they serve.  If the spells are not harmful to others, than they are beneficial to the Lich.  Spells come in a variety of forms.  They can be simple projections of the mind, repeated chants, intricate hand gestures, etc.  Regardless of the method, any Lich must take physical action in order bring about the desired change.  In theory, the left side of the brain (creativity) is what brings about the change while the ritual, gestures, etc., fool the right side of the brain (logic) into believing the changes can be made.  Every mortal has the potential for manipulating the world with their will, but there are only a small few who can actually learn how.  Fewer still are the ones who learn to master them.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time your character tries to use a mastery, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>
<BR>
A few of their powers require touch or eye contact in order for the Lich to use their powers on the intended victim.  For touch masteries, the Lich must touch them prior to the mastery having an effect (standard hand to hand roll, no damage; only if the victim refuses to be touched).  After they successfully touch the target, the system for the mastery is rolled.  The Lich must also make eye contact for masteries requiring such.  If the victim fights the eye contact, the Lich must roll 2d6+Mind vs. victim's 2d6+Body prior to rolling the mastery's activation.<BR>

While a Lich is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lich will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>NA / Instant; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between coven members, Liches have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The Lich can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its cult members as one, regardless of distance.  Each cult member must have the mastery Call The Cult to be included in the Mindspeak.  The cult must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.  The cult member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their cult name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the cult member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Cult members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>The Lich has learned to seek others out by manipulating their spell: Mindspeak.  This allows the Lich to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the Lich is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the Lich must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I><BR>

Effect/Description: </B> Gives the Lich the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The Lich may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The Lich may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The Lich may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed, unless they are thinking about their breed at the time.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene ; takes 1 round.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The darkness that the Lich worships has given them the ability to transform into another 'state'.  This 'state' is known only as Pestilence, the bringer of death.  When this spell is cast, the darkness will physically enter the Lich.  This transformation only takes a few moments, but anyone standing around the Lich will be in horror as parts of their skin fall off.  The creature will grow to be anywhere between 6'8" to 7'5".  The eyes will turn a deep red, and the stench that eminates off of the body is horrendous.  While in this form, the Lich gains +2 Body and +1 Soul.  A lich is unable to cast any spells in this form, and no mental masteries will affect them (hypno, obsession, etc..)<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lich to flawlessly detect the true nature of a target.  The Lich will instantly know what the individual's breed is.  The individual must IM the Lich with the truth if the Lich wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the demon.

System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / instant; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> By casting this spell, the Lich will call upon the power of the darkness to release a magnificant ball of light.  This light, which eminates from the outstretched hands of the Lich, is a representation of the sun.  If the target is a vampire, or a lich, and the roll is successful, the target will lose 3 body.  This damage must be treated as if the wound came from sunlight or fire.  Because of the massive effort to cast this spell, a Lich will be unable to cast another spell for 2 rounds.<BR>
