 and their Brethrens</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
When creating a new brethren there are a few things one should first consider.  Isle Voletta is a good sized island, but the city of Voletta is not all that large.  Liches rely on privacy and secrecy to hide themselves and their breed from the prying eyes of the population in general.  Therefore the size of the island determines how many brethrens there can be before overpopulation puts them at serious risk of having their breed discovered.  Voletta is large enough for five sires lead brethrens with no more than 13 members each.  If the sire tries to allow the 14th member into their brethren, the attempt will automatically fail.<BR>
<BR>
If there is enough room for a new brethren, the Sire-to-be must have created four Adepts of their own.  The Sire-to-be must also have been playing an approved Lich character sheet for at least 6 months and have Lore level 3 in Liches.  In order to maintain their Sire status, they must roleplay for at least 5 days in a character sheet update period.  A  Sire's power comes mostly from the combined energies of their Adepts, so the more pupils they surround themselves with that share the same magickal bond, the more power the Sire has.  The similarity of magickal studies and methodology allows the brethren to act in unison to perform great feats of magick.  His own Adepts are his power, but a Sire knows not to allow his pupils to build their own brethren.<BR>
<BR>
When an Adept of a Sire begins to create his own pupils, the Sire still benefits, but to a lesser extent.  The Adept acts as a magickal dam between the Sire and the pupil.  The Adept, of course, benefits the most from it.  Pupil's also count towards the brethen member total, though the amount of power they return to the Sire is significantly less than the power given to their creator.  The Adept acts as a barrier, blocking a direct flow of power to the Sire, keeping most of it for themselves.<BR>
<BR>
When an Adept creates 5 or more pupils of their own, they become a threat to the Sire.  At that point, the Adept has accumulated enough "magickal power" to break free of the magickal ties of their Sire.  If there are less than 5 brethrens, the Adept that broke free may apply for Sire status.  If not, they lead a brethren of rogue Liches.  Of course, the Sire who would sit by and let this happen are few and far between.  It is the rogue brethren who pose a great threat to the society.<BR>
<BR>

Liches who do not belong to any established covens are considered Rogues.  They are often wary individuals, unable to fit within the laws which govern brethrens.  They are often sought out by the brethrnes and eliminated so as to keep the magickal forces being used hidden from the mortal population.  Rogue Liches present other problems as well.<BR>
<BR>
Rogue Liches who lead brethrens do not gain the same benefits as the traditional Sires of brethrens do.  They also lack the social prestige of leading a brethren.  These two factors are usually enough to inspire even the youngest of Lich to vie for power.  This means one of the established brethrens have to be removed to make room for themselves.  Obviously, this tends to lead from political maneuvering, manipulation to the occasional terroristic attacks and so on.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>When the Magic Dies <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>If a Lich dies while they still belong to the Sire's brethren, all of their apprentices automatically become the Adepts of the Sire, or the next highest lich on the magickal chain.  For instance:<BR>
<BR>
Mentor<BR>
   Adept 1<BR>
   Adept 2<BR>
       Apprentice 1<BR>
       Apprentice 2<BR>
          Novice 1<BR>
   Adept 3<BR>
<BR>
If Apprentice 2 were to die, their student, "Novice1" would become the student of Adept 2 because that is the next link on the magickal chain on the way to the Sire.  If Adept 2 were dead or was to die, then Novice 1 would become the student of the Sire, as would Apprentice 1.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>A note on Rituals:</B> Should you find a mastery below that has a die system listed as Ritual, please use the following rules.  A ritual requires at least 2 other lich, including the Sire.  The group assembled must participate in the ritual.  The Sire is the one that actually makes the die roll, should the mastery require one.  In most cases, the will power of multiple Liches will easily overpower the will of an individual.  The entire group is responsible for paying the soul cost.  It is up to the Mentor to specify who pays what soul.  Participating in rituals is generally considered a thrill for younger Liches and a responsibility for the elder few.<BR>

System/Duration: </B>Ritual / Forever; takes 4 rounds to activate<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>What breeds independent humans also breeds corruption.  At times, the Sire may need to reprimand one of their students.  The worst punishment that could befall a lich is the loss of all of their dark powers.  When a student breaks one of the laws of the brethren, the Sire may call together a meeting, placing the offending student in the center of the circle of members.  After a couple of minutes of chanting, the darkness will exit from the offending Lich.  The darkness may never return to the body of the Lich, therefore the Lich will become a simple mortal.  Because of their strict codes of privacy, the darkness will also clear the victim's mind of any knowledge of the brethren.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>The Sire is capable of more control over the darkness.  During the transformation into Pestilence, the Sire is able to harness more power from the form, allowing +1 Mind (giving a total of +2 Body, +1 Mind, +1 Soul for the TF).  This form is also more difficult for people for people to recognizing, thus causing the TN of Sight Recognition to become 17.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>The Sire is able to change the molecular structure of anything in the world, including people.  If successful against a human opponent, the victim will not be able to make any defensive or offensive rolls, thus allowing the Sire to take advantage of the situation.  However, because the darkness can only be controlled to a certain extent, after the victim has suffered 6 body damage, they will be reverted to their normal state.<BR>
