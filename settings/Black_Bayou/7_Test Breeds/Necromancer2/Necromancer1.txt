Necromancy, from Late Greek <I>nekromanteia</I>.  It is the conjuration of the spirits of the dead for purposes of supernatural power.  Where Psychics have their evolved minds and Lamia have their fancy hand movement, Necromancers have their rituals.  The first Necromancers were Lamia who were thrown out of the coven for practicing darker spells.  As the generations passed, the Necromancer's practice became increasingly primitive, abandoning the memorization of spells for sacrifices to the dark powers.<BR>
<BR>
Necromancers are undead beings, but they share only a couple of similarities to their cousins, the Vampires.  For example, they look exactly what they looked like when they died… to an extent.  Necromancers' skin is usually a sickly brown or gray color because of their decay.  His ribcage is most prominent in his torso, looking as though he starved to death weeks before and his hair has fallen out.  Furthermore, inside the Necromancer, his internal organs are dead and decaying as well.  His heart does not pump, his lungs to not breath, his stomach does not digest.  The Necromancer is, in fact, dead already, so they don't have a pulse, don't breath, and can't eat.  A Necromancer through the course of his rituals remove one of his internal organs to be sacrificed to the Dark Gods.  However, the heart and the brain are the only organs that must stay, as they are through which the Necromancer channels energy through his body.  The heart and brain are suspended in the same location as a normal human being because the two areas are through which the energies travel.  Since no blood courses through their veins, they have no pulse in their true form (Sorry, no sex for Satanists).  Many Necromancers find new uses for teeth.  For example, a popular alteration of teeth is to file them down to sharp points.<BR>
<BR>
To perform a majority of their spells, a Necromancer must sacrifice various objects (Called "reagents") in order to cast them.  The other, less popular method is to harness a talisman and focus the energy through that.  However, the talisman must be made of Damascus, as it is the only metal that can withstand the power of evil.  Necromancer spells may also require chanting, while others still require the blood of a virgin (Which is bloody hard to find in Isle Voletta) to cast.  Traditional Necromancers have all the reagents they need for their spells and usually, when traveling, carry some in pockets or empty caverns where their organs used to be.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>In order to become one, a Necromancer must choose you to pass the power onto.  This Necromancer must empower a solid gold dagger with dark energies by rolling 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. TN 20.  A room host, ST, or GM must be present for this roll.  If the roll fails, the dagger will instantly imbed itself into the chest of the Necromancer, causing three body points of damage that cannot heal normally; see Healing below for details.  Necromancers that are four months or older do not need to roll this, as they are considered to be experienced enough with the dark energies.  Once done desecrating the dagger, the Necromancer must then seek out the victim and kill him within six hours.  "Killing" the victim means bringing them down to the negative equivalent to their body stat.  If the victim is unwilling, the Necromancer must fight him and stab him to death with the knife.  This fight/killing must be witnessed by a ST or a GM despite the victim being willing or not.  At a successful killing, the person will rise again as if they were only pushed down.  Suddenly, they would begin vomiting up blood and other bodily fluids.  Their skin will rot at an alarming rate and once again, they will collapse.  For this time, the character will be extremely sick, as if they had caught an exotic, rare disease, for two days.  During this time, the character will vomit blood and effectively "die" in as slow and painful a way possible.  Finally, on the third day, the sickness will recede and the character would be a full-fledged Necromancer, complete with the physical deformities.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> There is only one thing that can truly kill a Necromancer (see Lore Level 3 below for details).  However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Electricity in any shape or form will cause 2 points of damage per round the Necromancer is exposed to it.  Static electricity, a live wire, a cattle prod, or even Lightning are just some examples of electricity.  These wounds, while not deadly to a Necromancer, can cause serious damage since they disrupt the infernal energies inside the Necromancer.  Electrical wounds cannot heal normally; see Healing below for more details.  Necromancers do not age at all and, thus, live forever, or until they accidentally are consumed by an entity they could not contain…stupid bugger.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Lamia.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have played Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, EverQuest, and other Fantasy-genre role-playing games, and have come to the conclusion that Necromancers are evil Wizards.  You are wrong, you lousy bum.  You do know, however, that they work with the dead and undead and believe that they can resurrect zombies and skeletons at will.  You think that Necromancers are mortal, like Wizards, and that just beating the crap out of them will do the trick.  You also think that Necromancers cannot stand even seeing churches and men of faith because of their unholy powers.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Lamia Talisman:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Since the Lamia and the Necromancers are archrivals, their magic-empowering objects are natural wards against each other.  Whether stolen from a Lamia or using your own (if you are a Lamia), the very sight of a Lamia talisman will repel a Necromancer.  Even though the talisman will hold some power against Necromancers, it is the faith of the wielder that empowers the object to make Necromancers flee.  Holding the Lamia talisman aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the symbol and the Necromancer they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the Necromancer's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the Necromancer's roll, they are successful.  The Necromancer must flee the scene immediately for the next four rounds / two minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the Necromancer from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the Necromancer may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the Necromancer will collapse to the ground, cowering in the fetal position.  If the Necromancer is successful, he may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for four rounds / two minutes.  The failed use of a Lamia talisman will only serve to enrage the Necromancer, causing him to attack the wielder as their next action however he is able.  It is not possible for one Necromancer to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of Necromancer.  You've DMed AD&D games, created a MUD or two of your own, and even played a successful character on the Online America RPG, White Waters.  Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, still false.  You have learned that even Necromancers have limits to their power.  You have a better understanding of the different types of rituals Necromancers perform; your knowledge is slowly growing.  When a Necromancer uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the character's breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one-time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (Masteries requiring the Necromancer use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Angel's Blood*:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Angel's blood is, quite literally, the blood of an Angel.  Since true Angel's blood is extremely hard to find, clergymen's blood have been known to cause the same amount of damage to a Necromancer when charged with the attacker's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough blood for one attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the blood in whatever item they intend to attack the Necromancer with before the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only three attacks worth of Angel's blood may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than three attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered blood may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the blood is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved by a room host, ST, or GM. Attacks made against the Necromancer are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the blood.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the Necromancer suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The Necromancer must heal the damage as any normal Mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Necromancer heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 3:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have studied Necromancers most of you life, perhaps you have even known a few.  You know now the barbaric rituals they perform and you know that they do not look human.  You know that Necromancers can wield the power to plague an entire city, or just one person.  You even know the hierarchy of their cults and how one goes about becoming a Necromancer.  Having studied Necromancers or so long, you have begun to notice their more subtle abilities.  When a Necromancer uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one-time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (Masteries requiring the Necromancer use Will, Mind, or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> There are two methods of identifying a Necromancer by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Necromancer without an illusion hiding their decaying body.  If you wish to identify the Necromancer as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Necromancer and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Necromancer transform either to or from one of its illusions, being Human, Skeleton, etc.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST, or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Necromancer.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Platinum Dagger:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Platinum is the one metal that upsets the balance of power in a Necromancer's body.  However, a dagger of platinum is extremely rare to find.  The total amount of platinum mined in the history of man can fit in an averaged-sized living room.  In addition, it is an extremely hard metal, requiring that only professional handlers of platinum can shape it into anything bigger than jewelry.  The platinum dagger would have to be specially ordered and even then it would cost about $10,000 (Thus, an income roll would have to be made).  However, if a character were able to get a hold of a dagger, using it in combat would taint its purity, so it may only be used after combat is over, when the time comes to kill a Necromancer.  To kill an Necromancer, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the Necromancer's natural healing abilities.  Necromancers happens to be susceptible to a platinum dagger that penetrates their dead, black heart.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must place the point of the platinum dagger over the Necromancer's heart.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, empowering the platinum dagger.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. TN 24 must be rolled successfully.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the platinum dagger must be driven through the Necromancer's chest on the round following the roll.  The empowerment does not last any longer than that.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  Since an Necromancer's body has to be in the negative when they are stabbed, they are obviously considered prone.  No attack roll is necessary.  As the platinum dagger passes through the Necromancer's heart, the faith the character used to empower it is released, spreading throughout the Necromancer's body.  The body will spasm uncontrollably, then decay as a regular corpse at an extremely accelerated rate, until it has completely decayed.  Strangely enough, the area around which the body decayed will instantly sprout a bouquet of beautiful, normal flowers ranging from roses to violets.  The Necromancer's soul will then disperse in a cloud of dust and, finally, the Necromancer will stay in the grave once and for all.<BR>

It could be anywhere from the Necromancer's house to the cemetery, but to other Necromancers the area chosen will be the claimer's personal property.  This location is where the Necromancer does some of his longer rituals.  It can be a maximum of 25 feet in diameter and no smaller than five feet in diameter.  Since this area is the pure embodiment of evil, Angels may not enter this circle in any way, shape, or form.  Demons, who are only minions of Hell, must roll 2d6+Will vs. a TN of 18 if they wish to enter this area, because the evil is so overwhelming it can send Demons whimpering in fear of bigger evils.  A Demon Lord is immune to this effect.<BR>

System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 18 / Unlimited; takes 2 rounds to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Necromancers in their true form stand out in crowds: They look like walking zombies.  This enabled the Lamia to hunt down and slay the Necromancers.  Then, the Necromancers developed the ability to alter their bodies to make them seem like they were before they died, with full, working organs and a pulse.  However, all Necromancers starting out must learn how to turn into "Mortals," concentrating enough to shape shift and thus the roll.  However, this does not mask the true identity of the Necromancer: Forms of Breed IDing are still applicable when a Necromancer uses Humanity.  Since the body of a Mortal is not that different from a body of a Necromancer, all clothes and objects the character will be holding will remain on the body.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> NA / NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Necromancers have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the Necromancer will heal at the rate of one Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by Angel's blood cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from electricity and failed siring attempts heal at the rate of one Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the Forum Director.)  However, what separates the Necromancer's healing ability is that if he is brought to a negative number, he will be considered dead in all ways, except when killing a Necromancer with a platinum dagger.  When the Necromancer returns to one body, he gets +2 to all Attack rolls and -1 to all Soul-related rolls for the rest of the night, due to the power rush from returning from the land of the dead.<BR>

In addition, when the lighting is low or near total darkness, the vision of the Necromancer takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.
