 and their Cults</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
When creating a new Cult, there are a few things one should first consider. Isle Voletta is a good sized island, but the city of Voletta is not all that large. Necromancers rely on privacy and secrecy to hide their breed from the prying eyes of Lamia and the population in general. Therefore the size of the island determines how many Cults there can be before overpopulation puts them at serious risk of having their breed discovered. Voletta is large enough for five Shaman-lead Cults with no more than 13 members each. If the Shaman tries allow the 14th member into their Cult, the attempt will automatically fail.<BR>
<BR>
If there is enough room for a new Cult, the Shaman-to-be must have trained four Necromancers of their own. The Shaman-to-be must also have been playing an approved Necromancer character sheet for at least 6 months and have Lore level 3 in Necromancer. In order to maintain their Shaman status, they must roleplay for at least 5 days in a character sheet update period. A Shaman's power comes mostly from the combined dark energies of their Necromancers so the more pupils they surround themselves with that share the same evil bond, the more power the Shaman has. The similarity of prayers and rituals allows the Cult to act in unison to perform great feats of death magick. His own Necromancers are his power, but Shaman know to allows his pupils to build their own Cults, weakens him considerably. As the strength of his Necromancers serve to make the Shaman what he is, he cannot permit his pupils to build their own power base.<BR>
<BR>
When an Necromancer of a Shaman begins to sire his own apprentices, the Shaman still benefits, but to a lesser extent. The Necromancer acts as a magickal clot between the Shaman and the apprentice. The Necromancer, of course, benefits the most from the them. Apprentices also count toward this Cult member total, though the amount of power they return to the Shaman is significantly less than the power given to their sire. The Necromancer acts as a barrier, blocking a direct flow of power to the Shaman, keeping most of it for themselves. <BR>
<BR>
When an Necromancer creates 5 or more apprentices of their own, they become a threat to the Shaman. At that point, the Necromancer has accumulated enough "spiritual power" to break free of the dark ties of their Shaman. If there are less than 5 Cults total, the Necromancer that broke free may apply for Shaman status. If not, they simply lead a Cult of rogue Necromancer. Of course, the Shaman who would sit by and let this happen are few and far between. It is the rogue Cults that are the greatest threat to any society.<BR>
<BR>
 Either way, to create the Cult, the player of the Shaman must submit a Breed Leader Request to BBSTMail. Once approved, the Shaman will have access to the Shaman mastery list until they lose their Cult.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Rogue Cults</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Necromancer who do no belong to any established Cult are considered Rogues. They are often wary individuals, unable to fit within the laws which govern the Cults. They are often sought out by the Cults and eliminated so as to keep the dark rituals being used hidden from prying eyes of the mortal population. Rogue Necromancer present other problems as well.<BR>
<BR>
Rogue Necromancer who lead Cults do not gain the same benefits as the traditional Shaman of Cults do. They also lack the social prestige of leading a Cult. These two factors are usually enough to inspire even the youngest of Necromancer to vie for power. This means one of the established Cults have to be removed to make room for themselves. Obviously, this tends to lead from political maneuvering, manipulation to the occasional terroristic attacks and so on.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>When the Magick Dies</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
If a Necromancer dies while they still belong to the Shaman's Cult, all of their apprentices automatically become the Necromancers of the Shaman, or the next highest Necromancer on the spiritual chain. For instance:<BR>
<BR>
Shaman<BR>
	Necromancer 1<BR>
	Necromancer 2<BR>
		Apprentice 1<BR>
		Apprentice 2<BR>
			Novice 1<BR>
	Necromancer 3<BR>
<BR>
If Apprentice 2 were to die, their student, "Novice1" would become the student of Necromancer 2 because that is the next link on the spiritual chain on the way to the Shaman. If Necromancer 2 were dead or was to die, then Novice 1 would become the student of the Shaman, as would Apprentice 1.<BR>

<BR>
<B>A note on Rituals:</B> Should you find a mastery below that has a die system listed as Ritual, please use the following rules. A ritual requires at least 2 other Necromancer, including the Shaman. The group assembled must participate in the ritual. The Shaman is the one that actually makes the die roll, should the mastery require one. In most cases, the will power of multiple Necromancer will easily overpower the will of an individual. The entire group is responsible for paying the soul cost. It is up to the Shaman to specify who pays what soul. Participating in rituals is generally considered a thrill for younger Necromancer and a responsibility for the elder few.<BR>

<B>Experience Point Cost:</B> Innate<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> NA / NA; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A Shaman is a being that has mastered the a physical form. In fact, his native form is that of a spirit, a being a pure, dark energy. As such, they have the ability to materialize and dematerialize at will.  When he dematerializes, his body will turn into ash and collapse in a cloud of dust.  And, which he materializes, buried bones and dead creatures will erupt from the ground and form the body of the Shaman. While in this natural state, space and time hold no meaning for them. This does not mean they may travel back and forth through time at will. It means the Shaman may appear anywhere they choose instantly. A dematerialized Shaman may not be detected in any way. They are completely invisible to all the senses, including extraordinary ones. This means they are also immune to all forms of attack and may not be targeted by any masteries, except the Mindspeak of members in their cult. Transcendent beings that encounter each other are able to interact as normal. Many times, high ranking spiritual beings battle each other in the mortal world without humanity ever knowing.<BR>

<B>Experience Point Cost:</B> Innate<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> Ritual / 24 hours; takes 5 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> What breeds independent humans also breeds corruption. At times, the Shaman may need to reprimand one of his pupils. The worst punishment that could befall a Necromancer is the loss of their spell casting abilities. This mastery goes a step further. When the Cult joins together, they encircle the victim. The Cult recites an ancient phrase repeatedly throughout the casting. The Shaman then identifies the victim and calls their crimes out over the chanting of the Cult. The ritual is complete after a period of 5 minutes when the victim is completely stripped of all magical ability for the next 24 hours. <BR>

<B>Experience Point Cost:</B> 100<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> NA / Scene; takes 1 turn to shape shift<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Mastering the flexibility of his own undead body, a Shaman has the ability to turn into any true form of any breed he has level 3 Lore in.  For example, if the Shaman has level 3 Werewolf Lore, he has the ability to turn into a Horus.  A Shaman, if he has the necessary requirements, can even turn himself into a Demon or an Angel.  Once in the true form of a breed, the Shaman gains all the abilities of that breed.  Turning into a true form of another breed will also hide his breed to all forms of identification.  A Shaman can only use this mastery once per scene.<BR>

<B>Experience Point Cost:</B> 125<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> 2d6+Will vs. TN of 40 / Scene; takes 5 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The power a Necromancer Shaman has is unlike any others.  A Shaman has so much control over the spirits of the dead that he can bring a spirit back from the land of the dead back to the living.  If the Shaman kills any Mortal, Lamia, or Psychic, he can use this spell to bring them back to life.  However, when they come back to life, the victim must roll 2d6+Will vs a TN of 22 because of the shock of being pulled from their eternal resting place back to the land of Mortals.  If they fail this roll, their body turns into dust and may not be resurrected.  However, if the roll succeeds the victim will be re-animated.  Everything about them will be the same except for a permanent -1 Body, -1 Mind, and -1 Soul when they come back.  It doesn't stop there, though: The Shaman has limited control over the reanimated character.  For one, the victim does not ever attack the Shaman who reraised him.  The reborn victim will also protect the Shaman at any cost, sharing a magical link with its "master."  Whenever the Shaman is in danger, the victim shall come to his aid, provided he is online.  The Shaman can also give suggestions to the victim that he must follow, provided it doesn't put him in danger (Jumping in front of a car, shooting himself, etc. are not acceptable suggestions).  This enslavement will last until either the resurrected character is killed once again or if the Shaman is killed.<BR>

This is called "Ghost Fighting."  The energies have a strong ability to disrupt the synaptic impulses in other beings, thus causing more damage.  Invoking these dark energies will also make the Necromancer faster in both attacking and defending.
