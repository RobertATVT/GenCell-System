</I>Many myths and legends have surrounded Mortal cultures about ancient wise mean dealing in powers then man cannot fathom or grasp. These men have been called, Magi, Sorcerers, Mystic, Witches, and Warlocks... But is it simply that they can see the fine patterns of our reality and manipulate them? What is the Price for the power they yield?  These are simply men who alter the weave of the most base things in reality.  The elements.  The ages and myths of man have always held close to the basics that we all understand.  Those being the elements that all life and matter springs form.  Through deep connection to that element great and wise men have found a fountain of strength and power.  Through years of understanding and developing their skills they have learned to even become that element.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Initiation:  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>The Ancien may not be created in any normal fashion. In order to become an Ancien you must be brought by the Weaver to the Summons House of their sect. Once here the soon to be acolyte must vow the Tenants of Secrecy and learn the ways of the Breed. After this vow is made the fledgling must be coated in a ritualistically created elixir and repeat the Cycle of the Weave. The Weaver placing this liquid must draw the ancient symbols of their sect and write out the Cycle without mistake.  In order to do this he must make a test of Wills against a TN of 20.  While this plasma covers the new Ancien his body will be filled with the pattern and it will begin to flood their body and alter it in the fashion of the Ancien. The test is actually the pain and suffering of the change. The new Ancien must pass a Will Test against a Target number of 20. If this roll succeeds the victim will pass out at 0 Body and will wake the next morning refreshed and anew, his powers will manifest as he has been chosen to join the weave.<BR>
<BR>
Upon creation the Ancien gets permanent changes to his Attributes: <BR>
+1 Body, +2 Soul, -1 Mind<BR>

Mortality:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Mortal see recovery below.  ( Ancien Lore 3 is required to kill a member of this breed).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> An Ancien will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e. a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  There is only one thing that can truly kill an Ancien (see Lore Level 3 below for details).  However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Each sect of the Ancien has a bane element, if in contact with this it will cause 2 points of damage per round the Ancien is exposed to it.  For example, Earth Sect can walk outside without penalty, the air must be a forceful gust. ex. A hair dryer won't do it but a high pressure air hose will get the job done,not to mention 30+ mph winds will hurt as well.  A Fire Ancien will take serious enjuries from being immersed in water, but he can drink normally.  Air Anciens take an additional wound from metal or stone weapons, and Water are affected by fire like unto a vampire.  These wounds, while not deadly to an Ancien, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  A point of lost body will recover after one days rest if caused by a bane element.  Ancien age at a very reduced rate and could theoretically live almost forever.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about the Ancien.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Most people have read stories of genies and elementals and heard of fables.  Though what you know isn't always the truth.  You may think that the Anciens are nothing more than Genies or Raksasha, evil creatures or things that only come to grant wishes if you rub their lamp the right way.  Anciens are steeped in symbolism and it is believed that they can be injured by an opposing element.  Through all the movies you have watched of great magi walking across fog and drawing from the great elements, one thing you are sure of, with the power of the spoken word, there is little that an Ancien cannot do, and the terrifying forms they alter into are indeed stunning.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Since Ancien's are mortal, there are no Level 1 Lore items available.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B></I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Lore Level 2: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>You have spent years studying the lost myths of the greater Magi, not the witches and warlocks who throw cats eyes and frogs balls into a mystic soup pot, but the real masters of the magics that lie untapped around us.  You have also found a name to place with that small elite group of magic weavers, The Anciens.  These men seem to be the great workers behind technology, great achievement and the most renowned events in our age.  Most are businessmen and important people, using their magicks to assist them in dealings and the power gained to go through with their dealings, some however go into jibs where they can better utilize their talents, firefighters, construction, etc...   Through it all there is one commonality for this fractitious breed, the Weave, the touch of the elements.  Whenever an Ancien uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the Ancien to  use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Elemental Circle:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Through the ages the Anciens have had one thing to set them back and hold them from the weave.  The Elemental Cirlce.  In order to ensnare an Ancien in the circle you must first have the cirle created by means of powdering four precious stones.  These stones are Emerald, Topaz, Garnet, and ????.  These represent the earths connection to the other elements.  Next you must have bronze braziers at the cardinal points of the circle, the legs must be placed so that they are inside the circle and outside.  The brazier must have a kettle of Pure Water over the coals so that it can slowly boild and steam.  The braziers signify the water, the air, and the fire upon the earth.  Once it has been completed, the character must allow their own belief empower the circle.  To do this, the player must roll 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  If this is successful, no Ancien will be able to cross the circle reguardless of form or spell.  The steam and smoke repels the Ancien and is trapped inside they are unable to get near the powdered stones.  Another effect of the circle is that it cuts them from the weave and the elements rendering them powerless to anything but abilities, no spells may be cast.  In order to trap an Ancien you must roll 2d6+Soul+Faith vs the Ancien's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  The duration of the circle is 24 hours and no Ancien may come within 10 feet of it.  <BR>

You know about which Sects feud with the others and how their hierarchy is set up.  All the aeons mysteries involving the men of true magic are yours.  As a result of this mastery you know their tricks and have a basic idea of what their spell are.  Whenever an Ancien uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying an Ancien by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Ancien, which happens to be Animae.  If you wish to identify the Ancien as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at an Ancien, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Ancien transform either to or from Animae.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as an Ancien.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Element Dagger: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>In order to kill an Ancien you must first bring their body in the negatives equal to their body stat, so if you have an ancien with a body of 8 you must drop them to negative 8.  Once this is done you may get around the weave that anchors their soul to their body.  Their heart must be pierced by a knife made of Obsidian and encrusted with an Emerald, a Garnet, a Topaz, and a Hematite.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, focusing it on the dagger as it is plunged into the heart.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for hitting the prone Ancien so long as the range is point blank.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the Dagger will kill the Ancien instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if it misses (at long range) it will not kill the Ancien.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  The Ancien will appear to be mortal after it has died. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><BR>

When a character becomes and Ancien he is created in his Elements (insert creation place).  This place is dedicated to that one Element and the new Acolyte will be of that Element as well.  Only through serious RP and a good SL can a character switch their Element (which counts as a breed change)  Some sects will have masteries that can be bought at a cheaper cost than others so your choice must be careful.<BR>
<BR>
All Ancien must purchase three Skills in order to bring forth their spells. These are Casting, Range, and Duration. Level one in each skill comes free with your Breed change, after that you must buy them up with experience. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> roll Casting vs TN 18 / As per Duration Skill<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The Ancien uses this power to contact the source of his element. Once done the Ancien brings a small amount of that element into the Physical Realm. The element will be used up as normal after the duration ends. eg. Fire will burn until there in no more fuel to feed it and air will dissipate unless sealed, Earth and water will be permanent until eroded or evaporated. The Ancien cannot draw forth any Ores or specific Elements, for instance an Earth Sect cannot summon for a steel Blade nor can a Water Sect call forth the Hydrogen in the water. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> roll Casting vs TN 16 / 1 round for every soul spent<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> This mastery allows the Ancien to control his chosen element to some extent. The Ancien can increase or decrease an existing element in size. For example a Fire Ancien can extinguish a burning building as a Water Ancien could make a river flood. This masteries effects depend on the success scored.  For every +1 the Ancien gets over the Tn on his success roll 3 cubic feet of element are affected.  This masery will last as long as the Ancien continues to spend soul points, however, the following rounds effect only 3 cubic feet of element (Ex. Selene a Fire Ancien wishes to extinguish a burning house.  She rolls 3 over the TN for a total of 9 cubic feet of fire.  First round she lowers the flames by 9 cubic feet, second round she spends another soul and the fire reduces another 3 cubic feet.  And so on.)<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, an Ancien needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> Casting Skill vs victims 2d6 + Will <BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> This mastery allows the Ancien to see the Weave around a person and determine if he has any masteries in effect on him. This will not allow him to see hidden folk (Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, Transcend, etc...), but will allow him to see if another Ancien has a spell locked on him or a person is say under the effects of Hypnosis or another mastery. With Each level the Ancien gains the ability to learn more about the power used. The answers must be given in IM's according to what the Ancien can determine only.<BR>
<BR>
Level 1 - The Ancien can tell that something is in effect.<BR>
Level 2 - The Ancien can determine the effective level of the power used<BR>
Level 3 - The Ancien can gain the knowledge of what the effect does<BR>
Level 4 - The Ancien can determine what Breed the power comes from (req. Lore 3)<BR>
Level 5 - The Ancien can do all of the above and know who the power stems from. (Lore 3)<BR>
