</I>Many myths and legends have surrounded Mortal cultures about ancient wise mean dealing in powers then man cannot fathom or grasp. These men have been called, Magi, Sorcerers, Mystic, Witches, and Warlocks... But is it simply that they can see the fine patterns of our reality and manipulate them? What is the Price for the power they yield?  These are simply men who alter the weave of the most base things in reality.  The elements.  The ages and myths of man have always held close to the basics that we all understand.  Those being the elements that all life and matter springs form.  Through deep connection to that element great and wise men have found a fountain of strength and power.  Through years of understanding and developing their skills they have learned to even become that element.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Initiation:  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>The Ancien may not be created in any normal fashion. In order to become an Ancien you must be brought by the Elder to the Summons House of their sect. Once here the soon to be acolyte must vow the Tenants of Secrecy and learn the ways of the Breed. After this vow is made the fledgling must be coated in a ritualistically created elixir and repeat the Cycle of the Weave. The Elder placing this liquid must draw the ancient symbols of their sect and write out the Cycle without mistake.  In order to do this he must make a test of Wills against a TN of 20.  While this plasma covers the new Ancien his body will be filled with the pattern and it will begin to flood their body and alter it in the fashion of the Ancien. The test is actually the pain and suffering of the change. The new Ancien must pass a Will Test against a Target number of 20. If this roll succeeds the victim will pass out at 0 Body and will wake the next morning refreshed and anew, his powers will manifest as he has been chosen to join the weave.<BR>
<BR>
Upon creation the Ancien gets permanent changes to his Attributes: <BR>
+1 Body, +2 Soul, -1 Mind<BR>

Mortality:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Mortal see recovery below.  ( Ancien Lore 3 is required to kill a member of this breed).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> An Ancien will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e. a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  There is only one thing that can truly kill an Ancien (see Lore Level 3 below for details).  However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Each sect of the Ancien has a bane element, if in contact with this it will cause 2 points of damage per round the Ancien is exposed to it.  For example, Earth Sect can walk outside without penalty, the air must be a forceful gust. ex. A hair dryer won't do it but a high pressure air hose will and a 30+ mph winds will as well.  A Fire Ancien will take serious enjuries from being immeresed in water, but he can drink normally.  Air Anciens take an additional wound from metal weapons, and Water are affected by fire like unto a vampire.  These wounds, while not deadly to an Ancien, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  A point of lost body will recover after one days rest if caused by a bane element.  Ancien age at a very reduced rate and could theoretically live almost forever.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></I>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Most people have read stories of genies and elementals and heard of fables.  Though what you know isn't always the truth.  You may think that the Anciens are nothing more than Genies or Raksasha, evil creatures or things that only come to grant wishes if you rub their lamp the right way.  Anciens are steeped in symbolism and it is believed that they can be injured by an opposing element.  Through all the movies you have watched of great magi walking across fog and drawing from the great elements, one thing you are sure of.  With the power of the spoken word, there is little that an Ancien cannot do, and the terrifying forms they alter into are indeed stunning.<BR>

When a character becomes and Ancien he is created in his Elements (insert creation place).  This place is dedicated to that one Element and the new Acolyte will be of that Element as well.  Only through serious RP and a good SL can a character switch their Element (which counts as a breed change)  Some sects will have masteries that can be bought at a cheaper cost than others so your choice must be careful.<BR>
<BR>
All Ancien must purchase three Skills in order to bring forth their spells. These are Casting, Range, and Duration. Without at least one level in each their spells will not work. <BR>

<B>Effect/Desription:</B> This is the Elemental form of the Ancien. The different forms depend on the Anciens sect. Even the more insubstantial forms maintain physical form and can be affected by physical objects. All Items drop unless they have been dedicated to the Mage.  The levels of the forms are not cumulative, for example : At level three Animae for an Earth Ancien you do not have +4 Body and 1 level of Armor, you have +2 Body and one level of Armor. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Earth</B><BR>
The Anciens skin takes on an earth tone that gradually becomes more of a rocklike shell until at level five he looks like an Elemental. The material may be any natural rocklike substance. eg. Granite, Malachite, Hematite, Sandstone, etc.  The Earth Animae may move through raw earth at a speed of 1 meter per level of the ability if they succeed in a Will roll vs a TN:22.<BR>

<BR>
<B>Air</B><BR>
The Summoner becomes more insubstantial untill he is nothing more than a form of whirling mist and clouds, this form varies from Ancien to Ancien, some may look like Cumulus clouds while others may look like a storm is whirling ferociously inside of them. The Air Animae can also fly at 1 meter per round for each level of the mastery if they succeed in a Will roll vs. TN:22<BR>

<B>Fire</B><BR>
The Ancien becomes Immolated in fire a he takes this form. As his mastery of this ability progresses his body becmes more and more fiery until he is finally a body of fire held togther by his will. Each Anciens form looks different, the fire may be from a chemical blue to normal flame. All hand to hand damage done in this form is Lethal and will do burning wounds to anyone who is specially wounded by it.<BR>
<BR>

<B>Water</B><BR>
The Ancien becones more liquid and less solid until he is nothing more than a mass of water. Some Ancien appear as a calm blue liquid as if from the beaches of fantasy, while others appear as a murky or Bloody substance. The Ancien may seep through cracks in this form.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> The Ancien uses this power to contact the source of his element. Once done the Ancien brings a small amount of that element into the Physical Realm. The element will be used up as normal after the duration ends. eg. Fire will burn until there in no more fuel to feed it and air will dissipate unless sealed, Earth and water will be permanent until eroded or evaporated. The Ancien cannot draw forth any Ores or specific Elements, for instance an Earth Sect cannot summon for a steel Blade nor can a Water Sect call forth the Hydrogen in the water. <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> This mastery allows the Ancien to control his chosen element to some extent. The Ancien can increase or decrease an existing element in size. For example a Fire Ancien can extinguish a burning building as a Water Ancien could make a river flood. This masteries effects depend on the success scored.  For every +1 the Ancien gets over the Tn on his success roll 3 cubic feet of element are affected.  This masery will last as long as the Ancien continues to spend soul points, however, the following rounds effect only 3 cubic feet of element (Ex. Selene a Fire Ancien wishes to extinguish a burning house.  She rolls 3 over the TN for a total of 9 cubic feet of fire.  First round she lowers the flames by 9 cubic feet, second round she spends another soul and the fire reduces another 3 cubic feet.  And so on.)<BR>

This will not allow him to see hidden folk (Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, Transcend, etc...), but will allow him to see if another Ancien has a spell locked on him or a person is say under the effects of Hypnosis or another mastery. With Each level the Ancien gains the ability to learn more about the power used. The answers must be given in IM's according to what the Ancien can determine only.<BR>

Any of the masteries that are listed as spells go off the Casting time, Range, and Duration of the skills that the Ancien must possess in order to preform their Art.  Most of these will be Spells, however some are nothing more than gifts from the elements.  All of the abilities or spells use the Casting skill in order to determine success (unless oterwise noted) and to determine the time for the effect to inact.

<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time your character tries to use a mastery, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the weave around you that touches all things universal.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Ancien are a rather fractitious lot, and through the ages have created ways to combat each other.  This being the most effective of them.  The Ancien call forth the elements around him, pulling energy from the weave around them.  When this is done the Ancien may release it towards his enemy in a terrible bolt.  This bolt may take one of several forms depending on the Ancien casting it, from stone daggers, to fireballs.  This attack will do three (3) points of body damage to a target, reguardless of breed.  If the target is a mamber of your Bane Sect that damage will do an additional point of damage, totalling four (4) and will of course take much longer to heal than normally. This can be an awesomely destructive spell when in the proper hands.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When subjected to, and unable to avoid confrontation, the Ancien will draw on the strength of the elements around him to combat any bodily harm it sustains.  The skin of the Ancien will shift in appearence to that of his element, Earth Sect will become rocky, Fire Sect will radiate heat and get a reddish coloring, Air Sect will have small vaporous winds wrap around them, and the Water Sect will become an aqua tone, this effect will only be viewable by those with Ancien Lore 2 or the Casting Skill. The Ancien is more resilient to the damage they can take before the pain begins to affect their abilities.  Elemental Shielding absorbs 3 points of damage per round, then any other damage taken during the rest of the round will make it through the shielding.  The shielding will recharge at the beginning of each round for its duration.  This mastery is limited only by the duration skill of the caster.<BR>

This confidence, when firmly believed in, can strengthen the will of the Ancien greatly, granting them a +4 to their Will for the rest of the scene.  This confidence is removed the moment the Ancien fails any die roll for the remainder of the night, as its confidence is now shaken. This confidence is so powerful that the Ancien may allow others to hit him and still not shake their ego.

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Effect/Description:  </B>When an Ancien creates a place of his element that he can call home, a place to go for safety and sanctuary, he uses Sanctuary to solidify the area's bond to him.  The area must be filled with his Sects element, a cave or woodland burrow for Earth Sect, a room filled with braziers constantly kept alight for Fire Sect, a grotto or a cove for Water Sect, or the penthouse balcony for an Air Sect.  Once activated, this Sanctuary grants the Ancien a double healing rate for as long as he rests within the confines of his "home".  This also affects damage received from their bane element. In addition, Sanctuary cannot be breached by any being in Mist Form, Unseen,  or Spirit Form. Transcended beings -can- enter this protected area, but may not unTranscend while remaining within the boundaries of Sanctuary.  This does not bar people from entering his "home", only people that are not in physical form.<BR>
       Note: Sanctuary is considered to be the Ancien's home in relation to vampires entering.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> The ancien can become the epitome of what it was meant to be:  the impartial observer, a little space of timout in order to examine the weave around him.   The ancien becomes invisible to all sight, including infrared and all sound, though not imperceptible with touch or scent.  As an option, the ancien may be visible to one other person, but no more than one.  TN is 18 to turn invisible to all and 22 to be visible to only one person.  Should the ancien exceed a target number of 26, they will be able to touch and otherwise communicate normally with the selected target.  The mastery remains in effect until the ancien is either touched, attacks or otherwise comes into contact with someone else physically. <BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> This Spell allows the Ancien to unravel the power holding another ability in effect.  This cannot be a permanent or constant mastery but one with a stated duration (Dispas, Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Transcend, etc..) This cancellation is only effective for the Ancien, for example:  Jonathan Archer an Air Sept Ancien smells a mans cologne near him but there is nobody around and the airs are still, so he casts the spell and poof he sees Victor Martel looking over his shoulder at what he is reading, but he is the only one that can.<BR>

The target must be within range determined by the Anciens Range Skill in order to communicate in this fashion.  Whispers can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>NA / NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> As there exists an incredible bond between the manipulators of the weave, Anciens have learned to fine-tune Whispers during times of war.  The Ancien can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Whisper to its sect, regardless of distance.  Each sect member must have the mastery Whispers of The Sect to be included in the Whisper.  The sect must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The sect member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their sect name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the sect member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Sect members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The bodies of the Water Sect tend to be naturally gracefull and lithe however this mastery speeds them to inhuman capabilities.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the Ancien, as the Element within them has turned to its instincts, not human reaction.  This mastery adds +3 to all defensive rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Continuous; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>When someone is given the gift of the earth sect they can gain their strengths in many ways, this is one of them.  The Earth sect has an uncanny knack to take a good fatal shot and then just get right back up all miffed.  This is the trick.Any time the  Body statistic past 0, the character's will to live will drain it's inner force in order to survive.  No roll is required, but the Ancien's Body must first reach -1 for this mastery to begin.  The Ancien loses 1 Soul and gains 1 Body.  This will work until the Ancien has either drained all its current Soul or returned to a current body of 1.  This ability may only be used once per night.<BR>

This Spell can only be cast in their Elemental form and when combined tends to strike hopeless fear in the target.  If successful, the victim will be at   -4 to Attack and Quickness for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Ancien can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Ancien is as if was a dusk, thus eliminating any penalties from darkness.  Should any bright light flash in their vicinity the Ancien must roll 2d6 + Body vs TN 14 or they will suffer 2 points of mind damage from it.  Should the Ancien concentrates he can let the wind bring him a site from around a corner or behind him.  In order for this to work the Ancien must spend a round with eyes closed in concentration and roll their Will vs TN 26.  The image recieved if successful will be just a single flash no more than 3 seconds.<BR>

System: NA / Takes 1 round to Activate<BR>
Desription: This Gift allows the Weaver to Alter his form and become more and more insubstancial until finally becoming nothing more than a wraith. The Weaver and all dedicated belonings transform with him.<BR>
<BR>
Level 1 - +1 DefA<BR>
Level 2 - +2 DefA and +1 Armor<BR>
Level 3 - +3 DefA and +2 Armor<BR>
Level 4 - +4 DefA and +3 Armor<BR>
Level 5 - +5 DefA and +4 Armor<BR>
Level 5 - Totally insubstantial. May only be affected by Magical means or gifts. The Weaver <BR>
appears as a Grey translucent version of himself that can be seen by others. If two <BR>
Weavers are in Eidolon they may effect each other as if they were both in the Physical <BR>
world. The levels of Eidolon cancel out each other when attacking each other.<BR>
<BR>
Eg. Magus is attacking Raven. Both are in Eidolon, Raven having level 5 and Magus <BR>
having level 2. Raven gains +3 DefA and +2 armor versus Magus and Magus has no <BR>
bonuses versus Raven.<BR>
<BR>
The only means of affecting the Physical world is through the Weave. So a Weaver may<BR>
Cast spells from Eidolon only, however two Weavers in Eidolon cannot target each other <BR>
with spells as the weave does not effect their realm.<BR>
