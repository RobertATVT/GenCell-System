~WereCreatures<BR>
((LOCKED:  May only be turned in the game by an approved Were, after you have an approved Mortal CS. *Gators are test breed))<BR>
((Experts: ANT Bear1,  XBanuBain ))<BR>
<BR>
     Solitary, they wander alone, searching for ones like themselves.  Perhaps even more so, they searched for the one who could cure them.  A lifetime of searching, and still no answers.  The moon was their master, and their life was filled with little more than death and wandering.<BR>
     The origins of the Were are as shrouded in mystery as the Were itself.  Depending on which culture you ask you will find many different answers.  You will even find many different animals in the various cultures.  North America has the Werewolf and the Weregator, in some swampy regions.  Russia shares both the Werewolf and Werebear.  The differences are many but the one thing in common is that some mystical force has come into play.  Some cultures see these forces as a blessing, others as a curse.<BR>
<BR>
~Werewolfs<BR>
<BR>
     When you think of a wolf, what comes to mind?  The nasty beast dressed up like a grandma to fool Little Red Riding Hood?  Or the big bad wolf that blew the Three Little Pigs house down?  In many fairy tales and cartoons wolves are made to be sly and sneaky, or just plain mean.  But like most wild animals, they seldom search out confrontations with humans, or other wolf packs, unless they cross into their territory.  Wolves are beautiful, intelligent animals who are loyal to each other.  Wolves like company and live in packs, and the pack always has a leader . . . the strongest in the group.  Wolf families are affectionate and co-operative. They play and hunt together.  They protect each other too.  If one wolf gets into trouble, the others will try to help it.  Occasionally a wolf does live alone, but it is a hard life without the safety of the pack.  Lone wolves often die. <BR>
<BR>
~Werebears<BR>
 <BR>
     Do you remember your very first Teddy Bear?  Children have had Teddies ever since President Teddy Roosevelt saved a black bear from being killed.  A toymaker, charmed by this story, decided that a bear would make a nice, huggable plaything for a child and created the first teddy bear.  But don't be fooled by this, black bears are very territorial, and will raise up on it's hind legs and let out a ferrocious growl.  They won't think twice before attacking to guard it's home, or family.  Bears are excellent tree climbers, having strong curved claws. <BR>
<BR>
~Weregator ((test breed only))<BR>
<BR>
     They have stayed in silence, watching as beings unknown to them, hunt, destroy, and all out savage their beautiful lands.  They have watched for too long now, this enigma to nature makes its presence known....<BR>
     Want to scare a gator?  Tell him they'll never see the sunrise.  They're cold blooded creatures...of a literal sence.  They need to suns heat, without it their movements would grow sluggish....to the point of death.  The swamps, their home....without it, they are nothing.  The gator has to return to the swamps, much like a vampire to their coffin, to heal their wounds....so it's off to the swamps.....  <BR>
     A being fully content with their hibernation of centuries; slept quietly in the swamps undisturbed.  That was until an oil spill and explosion rocked the sacred area they slept.  They have managed to roam the swamps in the form of their animal spirit.  A creation, be it of demon spawn, or magical means....all that is known is that they have appeared, and with the present condition and pure flow of the land, they are not happy creatures.  God help those that evoke these creatures, their means are fearce when disturbed from their laid back approach.  They have disturbed and defialed their home....now awaken the Gator.<BR>
     <BR>
<BR>
Mortality:  Immortal<BR>
Means of Death:  (see Lore)  There are only 2 ways a Were may die:  by fire or "blessed" silver.  If a Were's body is burnt to death, that will cause the permanant death of the Were.  However, unless the character knows the other is a Were, they can't use it.  (ie. burning down a house with the body inside to make it look like an accident might be considered OOC manipulation).  Were's can also be killed by "blessed" Silver, which requires level 3 lore also.<BR>
Means of Recovery:  All WereCreatures heal extremely fast, except from silver and fire.  The Were will heal from fire and from silver once it is removed from the body at the rate of two points per week.<BR>
*Note:  This is all silver, not just "blessed" silver.  <BR>
Mandatory RP<BR>
  1)  The beast within comes out in times of extreme stress, and extreme emotions.  They have no control over their change.  When in Horus, they must RP themselves as raging, mindless beasts.  While in Horus the Were is immune to all mental attacks, and cannot use any mental masteries either.  However.....the Were will feel themselves losing control over their inner beast...giving them time to escape a crowd....wanting to keep their breed a secret...as there are many Were hunters. <BR>
  2)  Werewolfs and Werebears have extremely sensitive hearing and sense of smell, too loud a noise, or too strong a smell may actually cause a Were to be startled, or back away.<BR>
  3)  Unless the Were actually posesses lore, they are blissfully unaware that silver can kill them, however, they would learn quickly that silver burns them the first time they try on silver jewelry or handle a silver lighter...causing burns on their skin.   <BR>
<BR>
~Werewolf & Werebear Innate Masteries<BR>
<BR>
Healing - 0 XP - 0 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Were's have incredible powers of healing.  The Were will regain 1 Body every hour.  To make the process simple, all Were's regain the 1 point when the hour changes (i.e. they regain the point when the clock goes from 8:59 to 9:00).  Only wounds from silver and fire take longer, healing at a rate of 2 points a week once the silver has been removed from the Were's body.  For RP purposes, any limb which is removed slowly grows back over a 2 week period.  The damage from the attack which removed the limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must RP it slowly growing back.<BR>
<BR>
Mindspeak - 0 XP - 0 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: The Were is able to transmit mental thoughts and images to anyone they so desire.  With mortals, this communication is obviously only one way, but Were's can have lengthy conversations.  The range for mindspeak is 50 miles.<BR>
<BR>
Enhanced Senses - 0 XP - 0 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Were's have extremely active senses, surpassing both human and animal  characteristics.  When a situation arises where a player feels they can use these, they simply state it.  Final decision must be made by an ST, and this cannot be used to gain a bonus to any roll.  However, in cases where there may be given a penalty to a roll, these may be used to negate that penalty if the ST agrees.<BR>
  - Sight/Nightvision:  The Were can see twice as far as a normal human and in almost no light.  If they are in total darkness, or close to total darkness, they will not be able to see as far.<BR>
  - Hearing:  The Were can hear 10 times better than a normal human, concentrating on whispers across a noisy room, or picking up the breaking of a twig.<BR>
  - Smell:  The Were's sense of smell is extremely enhanced, to the point where the Were is capable of using it almost as a second sight.<BR>
<BR>
Shapechange:  Animal Form - 0 XP - 0 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited<BR>
Effect/Description:  A voluntary shape change into their animal form <must be stated on CS bear or wolf, must be the same as Were that bit them>.  They look very similar to that of their animal, except that they retain their original eye color from their human form.  While in their animal form they gain +1 body.  <BR>
<BR>
Shapechange:  Horus - 0 XP - 0 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Until stressful situation ends.<BR>
Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong.  They are upright on two feet, but can walk on all fours if preferred.  The form is slightly crouched, and the knees are slightly bent.  Yellow, cruelly-curled claws rip from the knuckles and the toes, and their body becomes covered in a thick, matted fur.  They appear to have no neck, the head seeming to rest on the massive shoulders.  Their eyes are slitted like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; none.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy.  +3 Body while in Horus.  A Were in Horus form is immune to ALL forms of mental control.  A Were in Horus cannot use mind masteries.  A Were in Horus must RP themselves as insane.  They show no preference to attacking friend or foe.<BR>
<BR>
~Learned Masteries<BR>
<BR>
Scent Recognition - 5 XP - 0 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  Recognition: NA/Tracking: Will roll vs. TN 22/perm.<BR>
Effect/Description:  A Were can use the scent of others as a way of identifying people, or perhaps animals.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person, or when they need to track someone down.  This mastery is always in use.  If someone is in range <50 ft.>, the Were will pick out their scent automatically.  Tracking requires a round, meaning, the player cannot track and do something else at the same time.  When in the same room, or, if out in the open, within 50 feet, the Were will automatically know who is around them.  If it is not someone they have met before, they will simply know someone is there.  By concentrating on a single scent, the Were can pick out it's direction.  May only be used on 1 target at a time and anything past 50 ft requires a roll.  Every 25 ft will cause a -1 modifier to the roll.  This is cumulative (i.e. 25 ft is -1, 50 ft is -2, 75 ft. is -3)<BR>
<BR>
Dulled Pain - 10 XP - 1 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  Because of the fact that Were's are known to be fighters, its body is able to handle the stress of physical attacks better then those of other breeds.  They are more resilient to the damage they can take before pain begins to affect their abilities.  A Were with Dulled Pain gains +3 to their current body once damage has been taken in a fight.  Not to exceed the current body stat.  ie. Joe has a body of 12 in mortal form...Bob hits Joe and does 2 points damage with Horlindo.  Joe's body reacts naturally, the effects of the pain lessened.  Joe's body stat would stay at 12 for rolling purposes only, absorbing -2 <Bob's damage>.  While Joe's current body stat would go to 10.  When Bob hits Joe again, for another -2 damage, Joe's current body stat for rolling would be 10, while his actual body stat would be 8. <BR>
 <BR>
Hunter's Hands - 10 XP - 1 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  Will roll vs. TN 20/3 rds/30 min.<BR>
Effect/Description:  Through mastery of their shape-changing abilities, the Were can lengthen and strengthen their fingers, bringing about the vicious claws of their Horus form, while remaining in their mortal form.  This allows an extra +2 to Physical attacks.

<BR>
Rending - 10 XP - 1 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  Will roll vs. TN 20/3 rds/30 min.<BR>
Effect/Description:  By scraping its claws together, the Were can sharpen and harden its claws.  The claws add +2 damage to the base of its attack.

<BR>
Rage - 10 XP - 1 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  Will roll vs. 24/3 rds/30 min.<BR>
Effect/Description:  The Were is inherently a beast.  As all beasts, they tend to strike wildly when in extreme danger.  A Were who has been brought down to half their current body level, or below, will lash out, attacking the closest objects to it.  If not already in Horus, will transform, then attack.  Adds +2 to attack and +1 to Inits.  The Were will attack the two nearest targets even if they are friends  (ST will determine).  This makes attacking a wounded Were potentially dangerous since their bodies will instinctively lash out.  It is simply a lashing out, meaning that the Were will not charge someone to attack.  The target must be in close range.<BR>
<BR>
Fury of the Were - 20 XP - 1 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  Will roll vs. TN 24/3 rds/30 min.<BR>
Effect/Description:  The body of the Were has natural animal quickness which allows them to act faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the Were, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.

System/Duration:  2d6+Body vs Victims 2d6+Mind/3 rds/30 min.<BR>
Effect/Description:  By baring it's fangs, and issuing forth a frightening roar, the Were can paralyze it's victim with fear.  If successful, the victim will be at -4 to Attack, Quickness, and Will for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in (attack causing damage).<BR>
<BR>
Scent of Sight - 5 XP - 1 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  Will roll vs. TN 18/3 rds/30 min.<BR>
Effect/Description:  A Were's sense of smell is so strong and acute, that their sense of smell can sometimes compensate for their sense of sight.  Were's with this mastery take no penalty for not being able to see their prey or their victims.  The Were can smell their surroundings as if they were actually seeing.  Strong winds or powerful smells can throw the Were off.<BR>
<BR>
Scent of the Unnatural - 5 XP - 1 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  Will roll vs. TN 20/Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  The Were's olfactory senses are very sensitive, sometimes to the point where they pick up on the presence of supernatural beings.  They will instantly know what the individuals breed is if they have the lore, if not, they will only know if the person is living or dead.  The individual must IM the Were with the truth if the Were wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the Demon.  <Mortals, Psychics, Lamias, Ghouls, Angels, Shadows, and Demons are living because they possess a mortal body.  Vampires, Doomed, and Fairie will smell dead to the Were.><BR>
<BR>
Blood Taint - 5 XP - 1 Soul<BR>
System/Duration:  Will roll vs. TN 18/3 rds/30 min.<BR>
Effect/Description:  The Were can turn their blood into a very potent acid by concentrating on it for ten minutes.  The acid can NOT be diluted in anything, but in its full strength will eat through an inch of steel in one minute.  Only two drops of blood may be turned to acid at a time.  This acid is neither combustible nor explosive, nor can it be mixed with other chemicals for such a purpose.  The acid may be placed on the tip of a weapon to add +3 damage, but the weapon will become useless in two rounds. <BR>

To make the process simple, all gator's regain the 1 point when the hour changes (i.e. they regain the point when the clock goes from 8:59 to 9:00).  Only wounds from silver and fire take longer, healing at a rate of 2 points a week once the silver has been removed from the Were's body.

They are more resilient to the damage they can take before pain begins to affect their abilities.  A Weregator with Scales gains +3 to their current body once damage has been taken in a fight.
