	We sit on the highest perches and watch over mankind.  Our eyes never rest and inside the buildings we protect there are no secrets.  We have been called many names over the years, Golemns, Constructs, and Gargoyles.  We are the Belam, named after our father, the first of our kind.  I will tell you our story, how we came to be and why we are.  Listen to our tale and learn of our foundation.<BR>
<BR>
	In ages past, during times of legend, men walked amongst Sorcerers, Angels, Demons, and other beings mystical and wonderous.  Those times held many a myth and legend, tales of powerful Gods and Godesses, and fables of great mystics and sorcerers.  In those days new powers were created and men tinkered with things they knew nothing of.  It was in this age that the mighty Belam were created.  <BR>
<BR>
	In the early days men feared the powerful creatures that walked in the day, but even moreso they feared the powerful creatures of the night.  Mankind hovered in the small confines of the light, hoping to safeguard themselves from the darkness that flowed outside their doors and threatened their very existance.  Men became prisoners in their own homes when the sun set, locked away trying in vain to protect themselves and their families.  It was after a group of powerful sorcerers were slaughtered in their own studies that the Belam were created.  A race created as protectors, to watch over churches and chantries, stone watchers in the night.<BR>
<BR>
	Many myths circulate about the creation of this breed, from the ancient Judaic rites of creation that make golems to the sorcerous paths of magic to bring life to the inanimate.  The most accurate myth we have to date is that a group of great men gathered, each from various beliefs and paths and combining their varied magics they gave the body of a man the strength of stone.  He was a loyal and protective man, volunteering to place his life on the line so that he could forever watch over his loved ones and decendants.  His name was Belam, and he is the father of his kind.  Hours of agonizing rituals and experiments went by, but the final combination of magics altered his body to stone and gave him great abilities to rival those of the creatures that the Council of Man feared.<BR>
<BR>
	Belam became a great figure in his home village, his strength enabled him to fight off some of the greatest of foes.  His people were no longer afraid of the night, they knew they had found salvation at the hands of their protector.  As time went by the ritual began to unweave, his body began to become more and more rigid during the daylight hours, until one morning the village found him frozen and perched on a ledge overtop the Monastary.  His stone eyes watching all that transpired below him, but he was locked in this form, the village feared that he would forever be lost and sought the Council to create another to watch them all.  <BR>
<BR>
	Belam's son volunteered that morning, having grown in his fathers image the Council agreed to his request and began the rites anew.  Once again it provided the same results, but Belam's son Argius was more clever than his father, and he kept his head clear and watched each stepped and memorized each word.  An hour before the sun set, another Child of Stone was born and he flew to meet his father.  He sat there, speaking to his father, begging his father to wake and watch him... never noticing the wet stains that seemed to stain the stone face of his father.  When finally the sun set Argius turned to leave his father and begin the duties that he had taken on, only to hear the shatter of the earth behind him.  When he turned there stood Belam in all his strength and glory, tears still streaming down his cheeks from the joy he felt.  The joy that his son would join him in his lonely task, but tinged with  the sorrow that his son would never continue his line and it would die in the night.  But he was wrong, Argius knew the creation... and soon more joined them and Mankind was safe again.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=11 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B>The Joining:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B>  The creation of the Belam is a secret passed down through the ages.  Creation is done through a rite that is both mystic and sorcerous in nature.  This combination uses both the ancient secrets of Golemn animation and the sorcerous rites to raise Constructs.  There are two ways in which this ritual can be performed.  The first method is by an existing Patron in the area.  for the Patron to do this ritual he must spend six hours in preparation with the newcomer, and he must have the ingredients to bring on the change.  These ingredients are the blood of a certain animal (chosen by the newcomer and must be chosen from Lion, Tiger, Bear, Komodo Dragon,  or Eagle) and an amount of stone equal to the mass of the newcomer.  As the six hours of ritual commences the new Belam's body must be painted with sigils of power, these are only known if you possess Belam Lore three.  During this six hours the Patron must remain in complete concentration on the newcomer.  This requires that the Patron pass a 2d6+Will roll vs a TN:24, if the Patron fails the ritual ends and the Patron suffers a -2 to all stats for the next 30 days.  If the Patron botches this roll, he loses a point of Soul permanently that can only be raised with experience.  At the conclusion of the ritual ( If the Patron succeeds) the stone (which the target must lie on through the entire rite.) recreates itself in the form of the newcoming Belam's Gigas form.  After the body is recreated, the spirit and flesh of the newcomer is absorbed into the stone.<BR>
<BR>
	The other method of creation is for three Lamia and three Psychics to join together in the ritual of creation, as was done unto Belam centuries ago.  All of the participants must possess Belam Lore three and the ritual takes twelve hours instead of the normal six for a Patron.  The rest of the ritual (Blood and Stone) is the same as listed above.  During these twelve hours the ritualists must pass a series of tests, the first is done on the sixth hour.  This is the test of Dilligence.  All six ritualists must pass a 2d6+Mind roll versus a TN 16, if they pass they can maintain focus through the entire ritual and continue the chanting.  The second test is the Test of Fortitude.  This test requires the ritualists to pass a 2d6+Body roll vs a TN 14, if this roll is passed they can stay conscious as the massive amounts of magic is pulled from their bodies.  The last test is the Test of Spirit.  This requires the ritualists to pass a 2d6+Soul roll vs a TN of 16.  If this test succeeds they will manage to link the spirit of the newcomer to his new stone body and the spirit and flesh will be absorbed.  Should any of these tests fail, the ritualists will all suffer a -1 to their Statistics for the next 30 days as the ritual went awry and pulled on their Bodies, Minds, and Souls to such a degree that they are nearly incapacitated.  <BR>
<BR>
  This is where the true test begins for the newcomer.  If either fashion of the ritual is completed successfully the newcomer must survive as his body, mind, and soul pass into his new form.  While this transferrance takes place the Belam to be must roll 2d6 + Body vs TN 13, a 2d6+Mind vs TN 13, and a 2d6+Soul vs a TN 13 (These rolls are done off the stats of the newcomer as if he was mortal, no other breed bonuses apply as it is their pure self that is making the change) in order for his body to fully survive the change.  If any of these rolls fail, they statistic rolled is reduced by 1 permanently and must be repurchased with experience (the breed modifies will still add or subtract as normal, they just lose a point off the stat before the modifiers are applied).  If the newcomer passes these rolls he will immediately pass out and be filled with visions of prowess and of himself protecting those in need.  The week following this change the Belam will have to get used to the new weight of his body and during this time he is at -2 to all skills involving the Body Stat.<BR>

However, there are a couple of ways to seriously injure a Belam.  Mandrake can cause serious damage to a Belam when it is properly prepared (please see Belam Lore Level 2 below).  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round they are exposed to it.  Fire wounds can be deadly, but can also cause serious damage since they take twice as long to heal normally.  See Healing below for more details.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B> A Belam will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 12 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e. a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  Wounds created by either fire or Mandrake take twice as long to heal than normal.<BR>

Stories in various mythical and religious texts tell about Gargoyles that come out only at night and eat women and children.  They are known to be dull witted and sluggish even when they are awake.  Greed surrounds these creatures and they tend to mass large amounts of wealth.  One other legend states that liguified Mandrake will cause grievous wounds to a Belam. Of course, you don't know all the stories do you?<BR>

Throwing Runes is a divination method used through most of the Nordic lands, and this method has passed as their people have moved to other lands.  However the uses of these Runes take on many aspects.  One of these is the ability to Ward creatures from the wielder.  The character must brandish the Rune and concentrate, focusing their faith through the object to ward them off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. The Belam's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character beats the Belam's roll they are successfull and the Belam must flee the scene for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the Belam from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions that the Belam may make are those that will allow them to escape quicker.  Should there be no place to run, the Belam will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If this attempt fails however, the Belam can ignore any further warding attempts by the same character for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of warding enrages the Belam and they will attack the character as their next action however they are able.  You may not ward a member of your own breed.<BR>

You have scoured through ancient religious texts and myths and fables, though most of this information is false.  You know believe that if Mandrake is entered into the bloodstream of a Belam it will kill them as it strips the strength from them.  You believe that the Belam can turn into massive creatures wielding clubs and great axes, flying through the night and attacking small towns.  Having studied them for a while you have learned of some of their more subtle abilites and magiks.  When a Belam uses a Mental Mastery with you as the target within Line of Sight, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs a TN:20.  It doesn't matter if  if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from the attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if Any) for that Mastery.  (Masteries that require the Belam to use Will, Mind, or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat)<BR>

It takes 10 minutes to empower a rune for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must engrave the rune in clay made of purified earth and mixed with Mandrake. The roll to empower the Rune is 2d6 +Soul +Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  To attack with the rune, the attacker must make a normal hand to hand attack on the Belam.  Only 3 attacks worth of Runes may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered Rune may only be used by the individual that created it.  If an attack is successful, the Runes suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The Belam must heal the damage as if it was caused by fire.  That would mean each point of damage would take 1 six days to heal.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Belam heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

The powers and rituals used to create another Belam are known to you, though you cannot create them.  Having studied Belam for so long you have picked up and know most of their powers.  When a Belam uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN:20.

Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Belam, which happens to be Gigas.  If you wish to identify the Belam as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Belam, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Belam transform either to or from Gigas.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Belam. <BR>

A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the spiritual nature of the Belam.  The Belam are susceptible to Mandrake, a root that symbolizes all the mortality and weaknesses in man.  The slayer must inscribe the Rune of Slaying on the Belams forehead and chest after he has been incapacitated, by using a piece of Mandrake root to inscribe the rune.  As the slayer concentrates and pulls their faith around the runes the Mandrake Juice sinks into the flesh of the Belam and begins eating at its spirit.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, focusing it on blood as it is fired.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for inscribing the Rune on the Belams body.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the blood will kill the Belam instantly as the spirit and stone is forced from the Belam and they die instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if the roll fails it will not kill the Belam.  No character may attempt to empower a killing item more than once an hour.  The Belam will appear to be mortal after it has died.<BR>

1) Due to the unweaving of the ritual that creates them the Belam are locked into their stone forms during the daylight hours.  They are aware of their surroundings as if they were awake but are limited to normal visual and audio senses, they can also only use masteries that do not require any amount of physical movement (Call the Gathering, Aura Sight, Communion, etc...).  In this form the Belams body becomes solid stone and because of this they are at the mercy of attackers.  Their Bodies are effectively doubled for purposes of determining damage to them (As per the rules for Breaking stuff if a Belam with a natural 14 Body is attacked during the day, they will have an effectove body of 28).  <BR>
<BR>
2) Belam are by nature an honorable breed, and should a fight occur around them they will do what they can to keep it fair.  Anytime the Belam are encountered with a confrontation they must make a 2d6+Will vs.TN: 20 to resist protecting the victim.  Belam have a high sense of justice and will fight to protect someone falsely accused of a crime with every ounce of strength they have.  Also, the Belam can never turn their backs on someone in need, even if it means putting themselves in danger.  This also requires a 2d6+Will roll vs. TN:24.<BR>
<BR>
3) The Belam must once a week get with his natural self, this involves calling upon the rocks and stone around him and communing with his natural surroundings.  This must be roleplayed for 30 minutes per week in the main room and witnessed by the host.  This RP must be posted in the ST's lair (Though it can be cross posted in one other folder for points).  These posts must be included on your Character sheet for each update (all four).<BR>

Effect/Description:</B>  The Belam are a race of protectors and were created to fight off tresspassers if need be, this is the form gift given to them by their Spirit Animal. This is the true form of the Belam which they immediately assume as the sun rises over the horizon for their day sleep (even though while in this sleep they are awake, Belam never sleep.).  Once they awake the stone form shatters off them and leaves them looking as any other mortal, but when the time calls to protect they can call that form back to them.  When this form is called to them they change grow an additional 50% in height and their flesh changes into that of the stone of their creation.  The head of the Belam changes into that of their animal spirit and huge wings sprout from their backs, while their spine sprouts a long tail used to guide their flight (this tail does not allow the Belam to grasp anything or gain an extra attack unless specified by a mastery).  While in this form they can fly up to 25 mph and carry the following weight as shown below depending on their modified strength.  Gigas grants the Belam a bonus of +1 Body, +1 Mind, and +1 Soul.  <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Belam carry with them the spirit of a great animal, and because of this their sight is increased beyond that of a normal mortal.  Belam can pick out details in his surroundings at twice the equivalent of his mortal counterparts and they tend to see farther distances.  At night the Belam can see as if it was dusk or daybreak that magical time between night and day.  Belam are only at half the penalty for any sort of visual obscurity, this comes to a -1 in Slight Obscurity (Just after Dusk (no light); light rain), a -2 in Medium Obscurity (moonlight; heavy rain), and a -3 in Heavy Obscurity (total darkness; thick fog)<B><BR>

<B>Range of Effect:</B>  Touch<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Belam cannot tolerate to see another being suffering.  When this mastery is used on person (or Object) the Belam transfers his essence (soul) into them which repairs damage done.   For every point above the TN above the Belam gets he will "mend" a point of lost body to the person or object.  Each point healed costs one point of soul and the amount isn't controllable and the Belam may very well be rendered unconcious as his spirit flows into them (i.e. if a Belam has a 5 Soul and rolls a 10 on the dice he will lose 4 soul, if the roll was a 12 he will be rendered unconscious.) The Belam cannot control the amount of points that are healed, and the target gains only those points to his Body stat and no higher.  A Belam cannot use this power on themselves.
