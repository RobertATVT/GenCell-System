</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0"><B><U>Brief Description:</U><BR>
</B>Rippers- Humans...we're all human ...in a way...<BR>
Rippers are simply humans.. ..with a symbiot.  A creature that resides in them.. and gives them some paticular traits.  This creature resides inside the host's abdomen, replacing all digestive organs.  <BR>
This creature is always prefectly fitting inside its host.  Having huge slightly curved forearms, smiliar to a scythe, attached to knobby tube-like arms .  This leads to a small curved midrift,  and large segmented legs, able to run and leap.  The face is small, with sharp teeth, and has small black eyes.  <BR>
They endow their host with many gifts, but Rippers as a whole are a standoffish group.  They do not travel in packs, and if not loathe, they dislike others of their kind.  <BR>
The infusion caused by the ripper also renders the reproductive organs useless (although they can sitll have sex, prengnacy by either side is impossible) .  <BR>
Their blood is near sickening to vampires, rather thick, and vile.  <B><BR>
<BR>
<U>Play Requirements</U><BR>
</B>1) All Rippers cannot become drunk.  All food and drink is sent to the symbiont, which filters are makes more effcient usage of all it's energy.  Alchol is like water, and they are natuarally resistant to posions.  A ripper host will eat twice what a normal person would, daily.<BR>
2) If separated from their Symbiot, the host will begin to feel slugish, and suffer a -3 to all rolls (this will not drop their total below 1 under and circumstances) they will also know the direction of their symbiot, and will feel the intense desire to be whole again.  <B><BR>
</B>3)Rippers get a powerful hormnal urge every 40 days to reproduce and propagate their species.  They become fixated on doing it.  If they are unable to implant someone within 24 hours the desire will work out of their system completely, allowing them to return to their lives.  If during the urge they implant someone, the urge will fade away quickly, and the ripper can return to their normal life.  The urge information is to be recorded on their character sheet, showing the date of their last urge.  <BR>
<B><BR>
<U>Creation Method</U><BR>
</B>Implantation.<BR>
Implantation involves taking a human (mortal, psychic, and lamia all may be implanted) And disembolwing them with the ripper.  The ripper will then devour their internal disgestive organs, and then proceed to regurgitate this material bakc itno the now empty cavity, coated in healing substances, and with an egg embedded inside the food.  Their stomach will begin to heal immediately.  Over the next day, the egg will hatch, and grow for three days, consuming the internal organs to speed it's growth.  At the end of three days the new ripper is fully formed and will begin it's helpful properties.  <BR>
This stand-offish group continues to survive in future generations, as every</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>40 days they feel an overpowering urge to implant another human, sometimes more than one.    They can implant another human by free will, but will seldom associate with this person afterwards.  <B><BR>
<BR>
<U>Mortality<BR>
</B></U>Mortal with regenerative abilities.  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the ripper is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to a ripper, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.<B><BR>
<BR>
<U>Means of Death</U><BR>
</B>Level 3 Lore. (shown in that section)<B><BR>
<BR>
<U>Lore Levels 1-3<BR>
<BR>
</U>Lore Level One:<BR>
</B>	 You believe people can become huge six foot beasts, which are vaguely remincent of rippers.  The large scythe arms, but wiht a hulking body, and large stout legs.. a thick body.  You think they can absorb peoples bodies to further their own life.  You believe there are very few Rippers.<BR>
<B><BR>
<U>Warding item:</U><BR>
Ultraviolet light. </B> When Focused upon a ripper, it will make them queasy, and uncomfortable.  When someone endows it with faith however, it will drive off the Ripper, both host and symbiot.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0">The user must focus the light at the ripper, and while doing so endow it with their faith.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the ripper's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the ripper's roll, they are successful.  The Ripper must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the  ripper from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the  ripper may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the  ripper will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the  ripper is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of ultraviolet light will only serve to enrage the  ripper, causing it to attack the wielder immediately unless otherwise restrained.  It is not possible for one Ripper to use this warding method on another of its kind.<B><BR>
<BR>
Lore Level Two:<BR>
</B>You're read up everything available on rippers.  You are now aware that ripeprs are small, another part of humans.  You think separating them will kill them instantly.  You believe the host is forced under the symbiots will.  You have seen crude picture, many of which are falsely made.  You are aware of the truths and falsities in the level one lore.  Having studied rippers for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a ripper uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the ripper use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<B><BR>
<U>Harming item:</U><BR>
Hydrogen Peroxide</B>:  Hydrogen Peroxide is the normal wound liquid empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough hydrogen peroxide for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the hydrogen peroxide in whatever item they intend to attack the vampire with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold liquid.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of hydrogen peroxide  may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered hydrogen peroxide may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the vampire are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the ripper suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The ripper must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the ripper heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<B><BR>
<BR>
Lore Level Three:<BR>
</B>You've studied Rippers, perhaps known a few.  You are aware of how implantation works.  When a ripper uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the ripper use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only;  cannot be used while in direct combat).<B><BR>
<BR>
<U>Sight recognition</U><BR>
</B>Require lore level three; Either by seeing the symbiot emerge from or return to it's host (witnessed by a ST, GM or RoomHost). Or upon seeing the ripper itself, you can identify the ripper as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Ripper and it's host, and not some illusion of the eyes<B>. <BR>
<BR>
<U>Killing item:</U><BR>
</B>Ret hot brand:  The ripper must first be rendered to it's negative body count ( 8 down to -8) Using an item, red hot from heat (a coal, iron rod) and endowed with faith is the only way to kill a ripper.  It must be pushed down on the body, and it will burn through.  Upon entering the body, the perosn must take a full round to gather their faith and empower the red hot item.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully, and a ST or GM must be present to have the item's heat penetrate the Ripper and it's body burts itno flames.  The flames will turn the ripper to less than ash, in burning agony and the hsot will begin to rot where they stand, now separated from something they were dependant upon.  They will die within the night, as their body rots apart suddenly.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Rippers Secrete substance that are amazingly regernative, healigh three times as fast as normal humans.  Any wound caused to the ripper will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by hydrogen peroxide cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><U>.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Upon aggravation to it's host, a ripper can emerge to deal with the situation.  The Ripper will rupture form the stomach and attack the problem.  They take half the body stats of the player (if the players body is odd, they may choose to give eithe rthe Host or the ripper the extra point), and recieve an added +2 body -2 mind and +2 to quickness (in example a host with stats 8 body would take 4body, the ripper would have 6 body) .  The Host body will remain active, still able to fight, if more sluggish, with a -2 to quickness.  They both roll inits, attacks and dodges separately.  The rippers actions are denoted with <rip> prefix at the beggining of their actions.

<B>Effect/Description:</B> A Ripper Master may find himself in troube, and before becoming unconcious, his symbiot may  turn icy cold.  This makes the master nearly impossible to brand.  If all the requirements of a Lore 3 staking attempt is made, you must also roll 2d6+Body+Athletics vs victim's 2d6+Body+Athletics (the Body is the victims particular max, not what they currently hold). This roll is a physical attempt to press the brand through their body before the metal cools.  Only one attempt can be made to break through.  If the attacker win the roll, the Master dies.  If the attacker looses the roll, the host will immediately revive long enough to retunr the ripper to it's place inside of them.  The Master will receive 2 points of free Body loss per round with no effect.  All other damage taken after this 2 Body will effect the Elder normally for the remainder of the round.  This remains in effect for the entire scene once activated.  On the downside, the Master receives -4 to their Quickness due to the frost of it's body and if the elder doesn't make their TN to activate this mastery, they will be stunned for one round due to the pain of freezing themselves and will be unable to attempt it again for 5 rounds after that. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>
