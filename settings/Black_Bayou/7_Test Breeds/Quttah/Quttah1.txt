<BR>
Quttah? What is a Quttah? It's an Arabic word, the first word in history, that means Cat. That's right, Cat. This breed of mortal have the ability to return to their natural form, the sleek graceful form of a cat. Who are these people? They can be anyone and no one all at once. Let's take a look at our feline friends. Solitary, aloof creatures with a keen sense of balance and a sensual appearance. Artist, Introverts, Rebels, Thieves. <BR>
<BR>
These highly sensual creatures have woven themselves tightly with society, much as their mundane counterparts have. At one moment remote and abrasive, at others delightful and energetic. Their moods are a fickle as the weather and equally as affected by it. They are neither evil, good nor neutral. They simply are. Preservation being the key element of their way of life.<BR>
<BR>
A Quttah is believed to be a descendent of the Egyptian Goddess Bast, wither this is true or not is unknown. The only truth that can be spoken is that they exist. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>To become a Quttah you must first be chosen by a creator. This Quttah must have the mastery Extended Claw. Once a Quttah has been successfully created certain effects are noticed on their bodies. Eyes have a slightly slanted look to them. The whites of the eyes have a slight yellowish cast to them which can be dispelled as jaundice.<BR>
Slowly over the next few months they become trimmer and more streamline.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Please note:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> only one Quttah may be taught (created) by any single Quttah per week.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Mortality:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> Immortal with regenerative abilities.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> There is only one thing that can truly kill a quttah (see Lore Level 3 below for details). . Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the quttah is exposed to it.  Fire wounds can be deadly, but can also cause serious damage since they take twice as long to heal normally.  See the Mastery Lick Wounds for more details.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> A Quttah will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would<BR>
require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e., a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains.<BR>
 How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  Wounds created by fire take twice as long to heal than normal.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Quttah.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have watched many horror movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You may believe that Quttah are evil, carriers of the dark.  You may believe they are evil creatures which steal the breath from babies in the night. Maybe you think their feline nature makes<BR>
them detest water. Perhaps you believe them to be the workings of a Quttah's wild experiments or even a truer form of the Quttah. Thoughts of witches and black magic come to mind.  Perhaps they are the wild incarnations of demons.  According to legend, the teeth are lethal and it breath infectious. Where there is a Quttah there is undoubtedly some wicked, old crone with a vile temper. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>Cat Nip: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>A strong scented mint (Nepeta cataria) that has whorls of small pale flowers in terminal spikes and contains a substance attractive to cats. Normal household cats crave this substance, while member of the Quttah breed abhor the very presence of it.  Their minds are what sets them apart from their kin, and the effects of this plant is like a<BR>
slap in their face.  Under normal conditions, they can tolerate its presence marginally, but it's the faith in the power of the plant that causes Quttah to be repulsed by it.  Catnip can be found in most herbal shops around the country.  Holding the catnip aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the herb and the quttah they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the quttah's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If<BR>
the character's roll beats the quttah's roll, they are successful.  The quttah must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the quttah from fleeing until the duration wears off and it even works on a quttah in major cat form.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the quttah may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the quttah will collapse to<BR>
the ground, cowering in fear.  If the quttah is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of catnip will only serve to enrage the quttah, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  The quttah will also change into their major cat form (if not already there) unless they attempt to resist the change with<BR>
a standard roll.  It is not possible for one quttah to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><I> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of Quttah. Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false.  You've learned that even Quttah have limits.  Certain physical<BR>
aspects can now be picked up when viewing a Quttah as well as mannerisms.  When a Quttah uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the Quttah use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>Rue Oil: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>Rue oil is the extract of the crushed leaves of a small aromatic bush. It is a bitter plant with greenish blue leaves and tiny yellow flowers. Formally named Ruta graveolens Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo both claimed that, owing to rue's metaphysical power, their eyesight and creative inner vision had been improved. Branches of rue were<BR>
used to sprinkle holy water before high mass, and it was an important stewing herb and antiplaque.  Robbers who stripped plaque victims protected themselves with "Vinegar of the four thieves," rue being an ingredient. <BR>
<BR>
Rue oil is nothing more than the extracted liquid of these leaves empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough oil for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the oil in whatever item they intend to attack the Quttah with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt<BR>
guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of Rue oil may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered oil may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the oil is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the Quttah are made as normal, depending on the<BR>
method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the quttah suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The quttah must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the vampire heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 3:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have studied Quttah most of you life, and perhaps you've even known a few.  Having studied the Quttah for so long, you've begun to pick up some of their ways and might even be able to recognize some of their markings.  When a Quttah uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN:<BR>
20.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the Quttah use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>To Skin a Cat:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>To kill a quttah, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, the quttah reverts to its true quttah form, then it becomes possible to get around the quttah's natural healing abilities.  Quttah when skinned,<BR>
lose their ability to heal and die.  The blade used must be made of steel.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must spend a full round of uninterrupted concentration as they summon their faith, focusing it on the blade that is to be used.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for hitting the prone quttah.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the<BR>
skinning will kill the quttah instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the time needed to complete the task.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> The Quttah can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Quttah takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.

We have all seen the big cats in the zoo, but to see one in the open natural environment that is a different matter indeed.  The quttah gains +3 Body while in its natural form.

While a quttah is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the quttah will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be<BR>
