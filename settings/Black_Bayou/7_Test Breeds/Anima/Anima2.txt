</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Throughout the ages mankind have lived in fear and reverance of the Spirit world.  Ancestors have been looked at through time as guides and mentors to the families they belong to, on the other hand, many have shunned and feared spirits as demons and antagonists.  Spirits return to the world for various reasons, some to warn their loved ones, and others to bring them to the other side with them.<BR>
<BR>
	The Anima are the physical embodiment of purpose and devotion, their life let to deeds and tasks for the sake of loved ones or revenge.  Most Anima are dedicated to a certain emotion or tight knit group of emotions (i.e. hate, anger, revenge).  This purpose has allowed the anima a second chance at life, their purpose weaving their spirit into such a driven force as to give it physicality.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><I> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> When a mortal dies, it usually passes on to another plane of existance.  However, when, certain things happen...certain things are left unfinished, the Anima are given a second chance.  The Anima must die in a way, leaving tasks unfinished.  The body and the spirit are seperated and the white tunnel appears.  However, for some reason, the Anima cannot pass through it and soon the tunnel closes, leaving the spirit trapped on this Earth.  An approved storyline is required to become an Anima.  Please note, the SL must be approved by the SL Dept. <B>-before-</B> your character dies.  This Breed is not to be used as an escape route if your character dies or if you suspect death, as per all Breed Changes requiring a SL you have 30 days in order to fulfill the requirements (Roleplaying and three (3) posts included on your Character Sheet) or the existing storyline becomes null and void.  Most changes to an Anima are a result of guidance from another existing one, taken in the form of them guiding you as you make the transition from the spirit world back to the land of the living.  In order to do this the existing Anima seeks you out and pulls you back, teaching you and guiding you.  This is done with 30 days of roleplaying after the characters death (Storyline makes the death occur) and the three required posts.  During this time your character is a ghost and cannot affect anything in the physical world, they are simply an observer.  When the time comes for you to cross over the existing Anima collects the items that will become your Anchors and gathers them, thenby focusing on the reality and physicality of those items he gives up a aprt of his purpose to bring you back.  The Anima must make a 2d6+Soul vs a TN of 14 in order to bring the new Anima into the world and solidify his spirit.  If this roll fails the subject is forced to spend another 30 days trapped in the afterlife, wandering and watching as he learns his focus.  Should the roll succeed, however, the new Anima gains physicality and manifests in purpose and destiny.  To this end, for this sacrifice the guiding Anima may select an Anchor to be removed without the loss of a Soul point (see RP requirements) and is one step further towards enlightenment.  (this creation post is required on the guides Character sheet as a link to the reolution of an Anchor).  At the time of an Anima's creation they gain a new trait called "Recollection" this trait ranges from 0-25.  When the Anima is created they roll 2d6+Soul vs TN 10, each point over 10 bestows one point of Recollection to the Anima.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> An unenlightened Anima will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e. a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  Fire Causes 2 points of body damage for every round in contact with the Anima.  This damage heals at a rate of one point per week.  Basic or Major Medical can be used to to heal or accelerate the healing of any injuries.<BR>

You understand that ghosts exist but only mediums can talk to them.  You also think that many ghosts are malevolent and evil, liking to throw things around and smashing objects around houses.  You believe that ghosts may be trapped to a place, forced to haunt it by night.  They often carry chains and rattle and moan out.  When things go bad, who ya gonna call?  GHOSTBUSTERS!<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Laurels:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Laurels have been used throughout history to repel evil spirits and those of the dead.  These are traditionally placed near or above a door to repel the spirit from the home or to bar its entrance.  However the way this truly works is that by holding the Laurel out and wilding it against the Anima.  The character must brandish the Laurel and concentrate, focusing their faith through the object to ward them off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. The Anima's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character beats the Anima's roll they are successfull and the Anima must flee the scene for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the Anima from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions that the Anima may make are those that will allow them to escape quicker.  Should there be no place to run, the Anima will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If this attempt fails however, the Anima can ignore any further warding attempts by the same character for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of warding enrages the Anima and they will attack the character as their next action however they are able.  You may not ward a member of your own breed.<BR>

You understand that they are lost souls trying to get in touch with lost ones.  They may or may not be tied to one certain place and that they have the ability to materialize in the real world for some time.  Some are malovelent but some are good, it all depends on the Anima.  When an Anima uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the demon use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Lambs Blood:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B> Lambs Blood has been used as a symbol of protection and purity for aeons, this symbol of sacrifice wounds the Anima gravely.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough blood for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character may hold the blood in a container of its choice, however glass baubles are most common. To attack with the blood, the attacker must use the Throwing Skill as per a normal attack.  Only 3 attacks worth of Lambs Blood may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered Blood may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the blood is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  If an attack is successful, the Anima suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The Anima must heal the damage as if it was caused by fire.  That would mean each point of damage would take 1 week.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Anima heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

You have finally discovered the truth about ghosts.  You know they are tied to certain objects or people and that these people and objects are the source of their ability to remain on this world.  You know that there are different types of Anima, (i.e.: poltergeists, caspers, spirits, etc.) that they all do different things.   When an Anima uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying an Anima.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Anima, which happens to be Eidolon  If you wish to identify the Eidolon as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at an Anima, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Anima transform either to or from Eidolon.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Demon.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Rubbing the Bones: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>The Anima is a spirit with a mission when it arises from the grave.  Their body is only now a manifestation of their purpose.  No matter how much physical punishment the body absorbs the Man Body resists returning before it's task is complete. Yet there is a way to free an Anima from this overwheliming sense of being.  The first step is to create a bone talisman using bone from a human corpse.  This talisman may take any shape but it must have a bloodstone set into it, this talisman will be used to draw the purpose and Spirit of the Anima into itself and hold it for eternity.  The Man Body must first be brought to the negative equivalent of its body stat. Once this is achieved, the Attacker must take lead nails and nail each hand and foot of the Anima to the ground, this frees the spirit of purpose from the Man Body.  After this is done the character must concentrate and focus their faith through the talisman to draw to freed spirit into it, this requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. TN 26. If the character succeeds, the next round the the Anima's Restless Soul is lulled into the Talisman to return to its eternal slumber never to return again.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
1) All Anima must choose a purpose that was unfinished in life.  This can be as much as to protect someone, Solve an unfinished task, or to harass someone you hated in life.  This purpose must be included in your SL and approved by the FD or SL Manager.  Characters may have multiple purposes if they desire but at least one of your purposes must be linked to one of your Anchors.<BR>
<BR>
2) All Anima have connections with their previous life, these are called Anchors and solidify the Anima to this world.  All Anima have five Anchors that they must choose to hold dear to them (ST or FD Approval required).  The Anima cares for and protects these Anchors with a single minded determination for a good reason, should any of your anchors be destroyed (SL or ST Event required) Your character will temporarily lose a point of Soul.  This lost point will return only after a New Anchor has been found to replace the old one, showing a new puropse added to your existance, this new Anchor must be approved by the Breed Advisor.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  An Anima can see the auras of those around them and with the above roll can decipher the meanings of these with relative ease.  With this power the Anima can determine the emotional state of the person he is looking at and can tell certain things such as if they are lying or if they have any mental disabilites or the general nature of the character.  Breeds and other such information cannot be determined.

System/Duration:</B>  NA / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Based upon an Anima's connection to their Anchors or those they love deeply, they sometimes are able to sense danger almost on a psychic level to their Anchor or loved one.  The sensing takes the form of a vision, that seems to flash across the Anima's eyes.  These visions occur at anytime the person feels an extreme emotion or the object is endangered.  Hate, fear, happiness, and lust are only examples.  They will know exactly what is happening to their loved one/Anchor, though they will not know any details except for a 30 second flash of seeing through the eyes of the Anima. Also, should someone attack one of the Anima's Anchors their protective instincts will be channeled into a blind rage.  If the Anima focuses their soul on the rage, they gain +4 to all attack rolls for the remainder of the scene. This bonus is only applicable after a physical attack causing damage to the Anchor, which is witnessed by the Anima visually or via their 30 second vision.  The Anchors are stated during character creation and can only be changed if another is destroyed.  <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> The Anima are Spirits that have taken on a physical form in order to perform a task or deed.  They can be injured like any other man yet they cannot return to the grave.  This power allows them to become what they truly are, a Spirit.  When an Anima takes this form they increase with supernatural strength and their mind takes on a serenity in their purpose.  When an Anima uses Spirit body they gain benefits as per what level they have below (New Anima have only level one Eidolon and can only raise it with XP).  Each level of this Ability show the Anima's ability to return to their Spiritual Body and leaving the trappings of the flesh.  As they progress in levels the Anima becomes less and less corporeal until he can finally become a full spirit again.  The Armor provided is taken from every attack against them each round, this symbolizes the fact that they are becoming more and more impervious to harm. This form looks identical to the Anima except for the slight bluish tint and translucent appearance. <BR>

<B>Level 4	</B>	+4 Quickness, Level 2 Armor<BR>
<B>Level 5</B>		Totally Insubstantial - The Anima may only be affected by masteries with this level, physical objects pass through them easily and they can move through solid objects.  While in Eidolon the character may be affected by others in the Spirit world as if they are in the physical, however the process is reversed.  At Level 1 the Anima gains a +4 Quickness, Level 2 Armor from a Spirit (Spirit Form, Transcendance, etc.), at Level 2 Eidolon the character recieves a +3 Quickness, Level 2 Armor and so on, until at Level 5 they are on even terms.  For Anima facing off levels of Eidolon cancel each other out.  For Example:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>	Character One has Level 5 Eidolon and he is fighting Character Two with Level 2 Eidolon.  Character One has a +3 Quickness and Level two armor against Character two, who in turns has no bonuses against Character One.<BR>

<B>Range of Effect:</B> LOS<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By concentrating on an object for a few moments, the Spirit is able to focus his inner strength, lifting and moving the object.  The difficulty of such feats depends on the object being lifted.  Objects may only be lifted and moved.  Guns cannot be made to fire with only the mind, however, you could "summon" the gun to your hand, and then fire.  The player may move any object about.  There is not enough control to use this to attack someone.  For example, with a knife.  The distance moved per round is 10 yards.  TN's are:  For every ten pounds (rounded up) the object weighs, increase the difficulty by one from a base of 10.  Thus a 15 pound object would require a TN of 11, while a 260 pound object would require a TN of 35.  If the Spirit attempts to pick up a living...or undead creature, the roll will be vs. the victims 2d6+Will.  If the target 'wants' to be lifted or moved, then the roll is based on the targets weight.<BR>

<B>Range of Effect:</B> Forced Eye Contact<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>By making eye contact, the demon can exert its demonic will over a victim, paralyzing it with fear.  If successful, the victim will be at -4 to Attack and Quickness for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in when the duration expires.  The Spirit Must Be manifested in order for this Mastery to work.<BR>

These are certainly the wrong people to ask, they never had the chance to find out.  Anima are the Spirits of those that passed on before they could finish a last task or purpose.  They are the physical embodiment of that desire to carry on.  <BR>
