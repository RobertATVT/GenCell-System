This is something I worked on tonight, as sort of a conterpart to the Quattah, that cat breed Brigit-mun worked on a while back. This is just the beginning - if you hate it I'll think of something else, if you like it, I'll work on masteries. Lemme know your opinion - and we'll wait to show this to the committee until after it is completed.<BR>

The story of Atlantis. <BR>
<BR>
A truly civilized city in an uncivilized time. Long before Christ, long before Romans, long before the Sumerians, there lived the Atlantians. They spent their days in peace and harmony, trading their valuables in a city of kings. <BR>
<BR>
And then it all changed. Massive earthquakes shook the earth and broke most of the city off and into the Atlantic ocean, where it fell, and fell, and fell... <BR>
<BR>
Pockets of air clung to the insides of well constructed buildings, giving those who survived the quakes hope that maybe they would live for a little longer than the end of the day. But then something strange happened. The Atlantians would find their salvation... in a plant. Kelp.<BR>
<BR>
Kelp provided a minimum amount of oxygen, food, and material for crafts, for the first generation of underwater Atlantians. They eked out a living on land under water, and were happy where they were. No bandits just outside the city gates to threaten, no taxes that they had not imposed upon themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Then, through the course of living under water, natural evolution took place. Some children were born with webbed toes, at first. Then, eyes adapted to seeing in almost complete darkness. There were two kinds of Atlantians: The Changed and The Old Ones. Finally, a child was born, a child who would change the course of Atlantian history.<BR>
<BR>
He was able to breathe water. He was able to breathe air. And miraculously, he was able to change his appearance, to suit who he was around. His progeny gave rise to an entire race of sea-men. His children: The At'yll.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B> To become an At'yll, one must learn the ways of the At'yll. It is impossible to change an unwilling victim to the At'yll ways. Also, the siring At'yll must be learned in the ways of his people (Lore 3). <BR>
Once these requirements are met, the siring At'yll will infect the At'yll with an incredibly virulent fungus, attained from a kind of algae that only grows near Atlantis. The actual infecting can be done any number of ways, from a ceremonial dagger digged in the algae, to a glass of wine containing it, etc etc. This fungus has never been documented scientifically, and disappears from the victims bloodstream within one week of becoming a full fledged At'yll. <BR>
The fungus will work it's way through the victims system, changing them, over the course of no less than 14 days. Initially, the changes affected to the persons body will be subtle. Webbed toes, a second eyelid, scales at the base of their back. By the 14th day, the victim will, in all ways, resemble a Mer(maid/man). Fins will protrude from their ankles, scales cover their entire body. On the evening of the 14th night, the victim will go through one last violent change, and will revert to normal in all ways... save those that are on the inside.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><I> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> There is only one thing that can truly kill a At'yll (see Lore Level 3 below for details).  However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the At'yll is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to an At'yll, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about At'yll.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></I>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><I> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> You have watched many horror movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue. You believe that mermen and merwomen are evil creatures who lure sailors to their doom. You believe their voice to be incredibly haunting, and that it has mystical properties. You are wary to let one touch you, for you believe they can cast love spells on even the strongest hearts. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Silica Salt:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>   Silica salt, the dessicant. It is only fitting that this substance, used to keep leather jackets and boots dry, would frighten a marine mammal. The warder must hold the silica salt high enough for the At'yll to see it, and focus their Faith through this channel. This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the At'yll's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the At'yll's roll, they are successful.  The At'yll must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the At'yll from fleeing until the duration wears off and it even works on a At'yll in true form.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the At'yll may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the At'yll will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the At'yll is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of silica salt will only serve to enrage the At'yll, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able. It is not possible for one At'yll to use this warding method on another of its kind.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></I>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of At'yll. Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false. You believe that At'yll are the descendants of the great city of Atlantis. You know of their abilities in water, and you also know that At'yll can shape shift. You still believe, however, that they are more beast than man, and that they cannot pose as a real man. Having studied At'yll for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When an At'yll uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the At'yll use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bane Water: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Bane water is little more than water infused with silica salt that has been empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  The water must have had silica salt steeped within it and posted in the ST's Lair message board area each day it is used.  The empowering with faith must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the bane water in whatever item they intend to attack the At'yll with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of bane water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the At'yll are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the At'yll suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The At'yll must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the At'yll heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

The rituals required to pass the gift of the deep are known to you.  Having studied At'yll for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When an At'yll uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the At'yll use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying an At'yll by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the At'yll, which happens to be At'yll Form.  If you wish to identify the At'yll as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at an At'yll, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the At'yll transform either to or from At'yll Form.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as an At'yll.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bone Dagger:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>To kill an At'yll, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the At'yll's natural healing abilities.  At'yll happen to be susceptible to a bone dagger that penetrates their heart.  The dagger used must be made of bone, human preferred, but animal bone is also effective.   Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must plunge the bone dagger through the sternum and into the At'yll's heart.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, focusing it on the dagger as it is used.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for stabbing the prone At'yll.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the bone will kill the At'yll instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if it is not used, it will lose the ability to kill the At'yll.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  The At'yll will appear to be mortal after it has died.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> At'yll have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the At'yll will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character soaks in water.  If the character takes any strenuous action or leaves the water, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps, in water.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, lean, muscular, and incredibly beautiful, the true form of the At'yll is a sight to behold. Covered in scales (the color of which depends on the lighting), their hair is absorbed into their body, streamlining the form. Fins will come out of their ankles, and webs will stretch across their fingers and toes. While in this form, an At'yll can swim and breathe in and under water as well as a shark. Also, the true form gives the At'yll an advantage over their less than perfect brothers (mere Mortals), represented by a +2 bonus to Body and a +1 bonus to Soul.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  2d6 + Will vs 2d6 + Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>The mermaids of lore have an uncanny ability to lull sailors into believing they are truly in love with the mermaid. While this is not entirely true, an At'yll has an unusually beautiful voice, and can often defuse tense situations just by serenading the agressor. By singing, humming, or otherwise belting out a tune (which must be roleplayed) and winning the Will roll, an At'yll can alter the victims mood a full notch (from Aggressive to neutral, from neutral to amiable, from amiable to loving). <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The At'yll can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the At'yll takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the At'yll can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a At'yll is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the At'yll will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>
