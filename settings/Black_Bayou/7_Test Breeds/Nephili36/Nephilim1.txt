</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>"In the beginning was the <I>Word</I>. . . " as one famous book starts, and with this <I>Word </I>God created the universe.  After that, he created Angels -- and thus the problems started.  The word Angel actually comes from the Greek word <I>aggelos</I>, which means 'messenger'.  Angels are essentially ministering spirits, and do not have physical bodies like Humans; they can take on the appearance of Man when the occasion demands, but at other times their appearance is sometimes in dazzling white and blazing glory.<BR>
<BR>
The Angels loved God, and vied for His attention as small children would a loving parent.  The most powerful of these creations, called the Morningstar by some, Lucifer by others, and the Lord of Light by all, was favored of God.  In all things, God walked beside Lucifer and they spoke at length.  Within time, Lucifer grew wise from these talks and rose up above the Angels  -- some say equal to God.  He spoke to God as an eldest Son to a respected Father -- full of questions and concerns.<BR>
<BR>
One evening, God confided to Lucifer that he had a plan for a new creation called 'Humans' and showed him the vision for the Garden of Eden.  Lucifer, appalled at the mechanical motions of the puppets God intended to 'worship' him, spoke out against these Humans.  The Angels watched from afar as God and Lucifer 'argued' about their fate, and in the end Lucifer challenged God to grant unto Humans "free will". <BR>
<BR>
Saddened at his favored sons impertinence God agreed but, in return, Lucifer and his followers had to leave Heaven.  Lucifer rebelled, and a War was fought in Heaven that raged violently.  In the end, Lucifer and his armies were cast forth from Heaven, never more to look upon the Light.  Into Darkness they fell, and their bodies and powers changed as they descended.  They became Demons -- a spiritual embodiment of all that the Dark stands for.  Hate, entropy, deceit, lust, and greed are mere examples of the limitless areas of control they manifested. <BR>
<BR>
After the War, God created Humans and placed them in the Garden.  Lucifer soon corrupted them, taking advantage of their 'free will'.  The Demons worked almost exclusively from the shadows, manipulating the mind and dreams of their chosen victims.  Slowly and methodically, they corrupted the souls of Mankind -- seeking to secure them as new soldiers in the Morningstar's army and retake Heaven.  Thus it has been for thousands of millennia -- a War between the Light and the Dark, for the souls of Man and the Gates of Heaven.<BR>
<I><BR>

Genesis 6</B></I> : <I>And it came to pass -- when Man began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them -- that the Sons of God saw that the Daughters of Man were fair, and they lay with them. There were indeed giants in the Earth in those days, for from this union of the Sons of God and the Daughters of Man came the </I>Nephilim <I>-- those born of Man but imbued with the powers of God.</I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
When God showed the Angels the latest creation, they were like unto a child recieving a new pet, or a toy.  The Bible talks about the Nephilim as the resulting price paid for the interest the Angels took in the race of Man.  These Nephilim were powerful, and soon filled the world with men of renown.  Men of power.  Men of nobility.  But the all too Mortal nature of man soon led some of the Nephilim to become corrupted by the Dark, and soon God had to step in and Flood the Earth just to rid Himself of their trouble. <BR>
<BR>
This irked some of the Angels, particularily Gabriel, who questioned why God cared for these animals.  God revealed to them that he had granted Humans a 'soul' -- in essence, a portion of His <I>Word</I> left from the days of Creation.  Gabriel was stunned -- even the Angels didn't have a soul, and quickly he came to dislike Man.  As time passed, and it was revealed God had saved Man from the Flood and had only destroyed the Nephilim, Gabriel gathered his forces and strove to destroy Man.  He reasoned without Man, God would again love the Angels above all.  The remaining Angels, led by Michael, strove to stop him.  Thus, a Second War in heaven raged above the Mortals -- a War that is still being fought to this day, along with the Demons in the First War.<BR>
<BR>
Along about the same time as the Flood, Lucifer was contending with a problem of his own.  A Demon by the name of Shaitan had arisin with a following of his own in Hell.  The Dark favored Shaitan with powers similar to Lucifer, so the Morningstar strove to meet terms with this Demon.  Lucifer found that Shaitan wanted to destroy all of Creation starting with Mankind and ending with the undoing of the <I>Word</I>.  In Shaitan's opinion, this would reset everything and all of God's Children would once again be united in his Grace.  To start again, and this time to be equals with the Creator.  Lucifer, however, strove to protect Mankind, so that he could use them and corrupt them and swell his ranks.  An uncivil War echoed that one in Heaven as the Demons fought.<BR>

	Dark :  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>When a Demon is summoned, the Dark will send a representative of itself up from the depths to merge with the Mortal.  The resulting creature is a Nephilim of the Dark -- A Demon on Earth in a Mortal's body.  Depending on the situation, the Mortal may not even be aware the Demon has possessed them -- but will act as the Demon instructs . . . never realizing these actions and thoughts are not their own.  Such is the manipulative power of Evil.<BR>
<BR>
In both cases, the merging with the Mortal body wipes away all of the Angel's or Demon's extensive powers, except for a few innate 'special abilities'.  Over time, the Nephilim will strive to relearn how to master some of its old power, using the Mortal form they now possess. <BR>

This makes them somewhat Immortal.  There is only one thing that can truly kill a Nephilim (see Lore Level 3 below for details).  However, there is one other way to seriously injure one.  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the Nephilim is exposed to it.  These wounds, while not deadly to a Nephilim, can cause serious damage since they cannot be healed normally.  See Healing below for more details.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of Lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Nephilim.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>  You have watched many Hollywood movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You believe Light and Dark Nephilim come in many shapes and forms.  You may believe they are symbolic in their presence and my not truly exist in the physical world at all.  If they did appear, you might assume they'd be large man-shaped creatures who can fly using their mighty feathered or leathery wings.  An Angel is never seen without its golden halo hovering inches above its head, symbolizing all that is good in its soul.  Some will even believe they have a guardian Angel constantly watching over them. By contrast, a Demon is a horrifying agent of the Dark who can control the minds of all around to further their corruptive ends.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Symbol:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Faith symbols can be any number of items.  A Crucifix, a scarred and broken statue of the Virgin, a Star of David, an inverted cross, an infinity symbol, etc.  They must be actual objects, not a pattern sewn into clothing, for instance.  The object itself has absolutely no power whatsoever.  It is the Faith of the wielder that empowers the object.  Holding the faith symbol aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their Faith on the symbol and the Nephilim they are attempting to Ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the Nephilim's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the Nephilim's roll, they are successful.  The Nephilim must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the Nephilim from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic, and the only actions the Nephilim may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the Nephilim will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the Nephilim is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of Warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of a faith symbol will only serve to enrage the Nephilim, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able.  It is not possible for one Nephilim to use this warding method on another of its kind -- that is, an Angel can't Ward an Angel, and a Demon can't Ward a Demon. Either can Ward the other, however.<BR>

Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false.  You know that the destructive nature of fire can burn and seriously injure Nephilim.  You have also discovered that Nephilim  are vulnerable to their opposites -- Angels to the powers of Evil and Demons to the forces of Good.  Any item imbued with this emotional energy causes serious wounds to a Nephilim.  When a Nephilim uses a mental Mastery with you as the target, within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters Breed -- your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that Mastery.  (Defense is only good against Masteries requiring the Nephilim to use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; it cannot be used while in direct combat with the Nephilim).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Water:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>Faith water is little more than water empowered with the character's Faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the Nephilim with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of Faith water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved by either a Room Host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the Nephilim are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the Small Arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the Nephilim suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The Nephilim must heal the damage as any normal Mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Nephilim heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

You have finally discovered the truth about the Light and the Dark Nephilim.  You know how they may be divided into different groups (i.e. Angels, Demons, ArchAngels, Demon Lords, etc).  You also know that they join themselves with Mortal hosts in order to directly affect the physical world.  Having studied Nephilim for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a Nephilim uses a mental Mastery with you as the target, within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters Breed -- your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that Mastery.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Nephilim by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the Breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the "True Form", or <I>Nominare</I>, of the Nephilim.  If you wish to identify the <I>Nominare</I> as a Breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at an <I>Nominare</I> , and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Nephilim transform either to, or from, <I>Nominare</I> .  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a legendary Nephilim.  ((As a side note, all Nephilim bear a brand, tattoo, scar or what have you somewhere on their Mortal bodies.  This is their name in the language of the <I>Word</I>.  Sometimes, these symbols have made their way into ancient religious texts as "Angelic Script" or "Demonic Scrawl".  Once the Breed is reconized, the symbol becomes redilly visible to those who look for it.))<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>CWI Dagger: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>A dagger of cold wrought iron is little more than dagger forged from cold rather than heat.  The making of these daggers are too difficult for the average person to make -- however they are not rare and can be found in specialty knife shops.  Cold wrought iron is too soft to be used in combat -- however, combat is usually over when the time comes to kill a Nephilim.<B>  </B>To kill a Nephilim, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their Body statistic.  A Body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the Nephilim's natural healing abilities.  Nephilim's happen to be susceptible to a cold wrought iron dagger that penetrates the brain-stem at the base of their skull.  Once the appropriate Body number is achieved, the attacker must place the point of the CWI dagger at the base of the Nephilim's skull.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their Faith, empowering the CWI dagger.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the CWI dagger must be driven through the Nephilim's neck, severing the brain-stem on the round following the roll.  The empowerment does not last any longer than that.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  As the CWI dagger passes through the Nephilim's brain-stem, the Faith the character used to empower it is released, spreading throughout the Nephilim's body.  This causes the body to burn internally and, on the following round, the flames will erupt around the body.  Seconds later, nothing will remain of the body as the ashes are extremely thin, disintegrating with any kind of contact.  The spirit of the Nephilim is then dispersed, driven back to the Dark or the Light, depending.  Since a Nephilim's body has to be in the negative when they are stabbed, they are obviously considered prone.  No attack roll is necessary.<BR>
