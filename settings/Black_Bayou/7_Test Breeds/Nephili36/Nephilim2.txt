Upon creating a Nephilim, the player must choose a side -- Light or Dark, and a philosophy -- Pro or Con. Then, follow the rules below :<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Nephilim have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the Nephilim or its Host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by Faith Water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:LDRS ANT BBMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Nephilim is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Nephilim attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By sniffing the air about her, a Nephilim is capable of detecting the presence of any nearby Nephilim. The energies of any given Nephilim radiate like a beacon, making ripples on the essences of nearby Nephilim and giving them "warning".  They will not instantly know who the Nephilim is, or even their alignment -- only that a Nephilim is close at hand.  This is a spiritual sensation, not a physical one -- although it is conducted by sniffing -- and therefore cannot be evaded or masked.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is the true shape of the Nephilim -- a being of raw power and deified emotion.  Depending upon the allegience of the Nephilim, the Nominare differs in description.  Nephilim have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to <A HREF="mailto:LDRSANTBBMail?subject=Angel Volange Form Request">LDRS ANT BBMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

By exerting its will, the Angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its Mortal host.  The description of this materilization is left up to the player to RP, but the form varies greatly from Angel to Angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  Saviours sometimes prefer the soft, traditional kind of shape, whereas Warriors often do not take on mortal-like form.  There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The Nominare form will always radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I>Dark Nominare :		</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>A Demon is capable of forcing its Nominare form upon its Mortal host body.  A Demon that assumes it's true form will rip free from its Host body, physically.  The description of this expulsion is left up to the player to RP, but the form varies greatly from Demon to Demon, depending upon which aspect of the Dark they represent.  Corruptors sometimes prefer anything that will ease their victims mind, while Warriors often take on the shape of horrific monsters. The Nominare form will always be huge (9' tall or so) and posses black, leathery wings sprouting from its back.  These can be used to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Demons gain +3 Body when in Nominare.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a Nephilim is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Nephilim will immediately change back to Mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>
