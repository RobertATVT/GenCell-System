Evil AI entities, bent on destruction? For the Cybrids, the children of CABAL, these definitions are 100% true. The offspring of the corrupting Artificial Intelligence CABAL, these beings seek to overthrow the biological races of Earth in corrospondence with Darwinism... The strongest<BR>
survive. And the Cybrids know they are the strongest creatures ever.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>	What are Cybrids? Mortals chosen by the Core to be processed in a dangerous operation to create the hybrid of computer and human. The human consciousness is annihilated, exchanged for a powerful AI. The body is fundamentally changed and enhanced, yet disguised as human. The result? The ultimate evolution.... Human and machine, the best way to exterminate the wasteful species.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
	The Becoming: The Becoming is a painful and dangerous experience. Regardless of time or Will, the one Becoming must suceed a Body roll vs. TN 16. In this process, various organs are replaced with cybernetic implants and others are just eliminated. The consciousness is transformed into an AI entity to live within a computer, controling the body by remote uplink.<BR>

Large amounts of electricity cause the Cybrid 2 points of damage per round that the Cybrid is exposed to it.  While these wounds are very damaging, they cannot kill a Cybrid and are not healed as normal.  See Healing below for more<BR>
details.  Extreme cold, such as prolonged subzero temperatures, causes the tech to also be unable to regenerate any lost Body.  Once the Cybrid has been removed from the situation, healing begins again at once.<BR>

You've seen all the Terminator movies, and have rather extensive knowledge of the 'Borg.  You are certain that anything that can be considered a man/machine hybrid has no feelings.

aware that strong electrical surges can harm, possibly even kill a Cybrid.  Having studied Cybrids for so long, you have been able to learn how to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a Cybrid uses a mental mastery with you as the target,  and you are within line of sight, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs a TN 20.  It does not matter if you know the character's breed, your mind will still attempt to defend itself from being affected, even though you might<BR>
not have any realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and it's effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (Masteries requiring Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; Cannot be used while in direct combat.)<BR>

RP Requirements<BR>
1) The Cybrid's consciousness is stored within a computer at all times. This computer may be of any form of high end computing, be it laptop, desktop, or mainframe. Though SL's may be devised to protect it, a Cybrid <B>must</B> be able to access it every night. If they cannot(Too efficient guarding measures, it was stolen, they are captured), they cannot use any special abilities or masteries until they can re-access. If the computer is ever<BR>
destroyed without using Lore 3 killing, the Cybrid must gain a new one and redownload themselves into it, a process which takes twenty four hours before they can use their powers again.<BR>
<BR>
2) <B>The Edicts of CABAL.</B><BR>
A)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="0">Primary Objective: To inhibit the sentient organic race "Human" at all opportunities, unless probability of detection exceeds safe levels.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>
B) Secondary Objective: Analysis of Human Variants.<BR>
Any opportunity to continue ongoing research on the human variants which have proved to be difficult to kill is to be taken, no matter what the personal cost.<BR>
<BR>
Those Cybrids not following the Primary and Secondary Objectives will be judged by the Core, and if found guilty, terminated and used for organic and cybernetic parts. Any Cybrid found to be harboring true emotions will be similarly executed. Though mimicing of humans is necessary to conceal the Cybrids, synthesizing emotions fully is an offense to the First Though//Bringer of Will<BR>
<BR>
3) All Cybrids are incredibly analytical and logical in nature, thus truly understanding and believing in the breeds is difficult at best. Everything has a scientific answer for these machines, and they will find it. Faith is a human quality, and the Core is unlikely to approve.<BR>
<BR>
4) All Cybrids, due to their nature, have a fear of electrical storms. A will roll against TN 26 must be succeeded to venture out in a thunderstorm, and a will roll against a TN of 34 must be suceeded to go outside during a hurricane. A Cybrid who has been a Cybrid for a full year may pass up the will roll for thunderstorms, but all Cybrids must make the roll for hurricanes. No exception.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: Cybrids </B>have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the Cybrid will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour.  Total rest is not required for this healing to take place.  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">ForumDirector</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B><I>Cyborg </I>- 0 Soul to use (##Cyborg##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>Cybrids are much more than human. By concentrating, they can cause the true machine to reveal itself, integrating itself with the human exterior. By doing so, the Cybrid becomes larger, stronger, and definately anything but human. In Cyborg Form, they stand a full nine foot tall, four foot wide, and have various cybernetic implants sticking out of them. They are terrible things to behold, with eyes that glow red as they<BR>
scan the infrared spectrum. They gain a +3 bonus to Body while in Cyborg form, in addition to a +3 to any computer related roll. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding<BR>
will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

System/Duration: Roll 2d6+Will Vs. TN 28/Instant, takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Description: Cybrids are naturally "In Tune" with their mentally inadequete brothers, the computers that run our world. By focusing their processing power into the computer, they can gain added skill with manipulating it. This applies to all computer skill rolls, including Engineering, Hacking, and Programming. A successful roll gives a +2 bonus, with an addition +1 for every 2 points over the TN. This is cumulative with the bonuses from Cyborg form.<BR>

Autocannon -1 Soul to use (##AutoCannon##)<BR>
Gen Cost 15 XP Cost 75<BR>
System/Duration: 2d6+Body Vs. TN 16/Scene<BR>
Description: Cybrids are combative killers. When they need to strike something far away, they can manipulate their cybernetic implants into awesome weaponry, growing out of their body. This could be a chaingun forming from a forearm, a shoulder mounted gun, or other such sci-fi terrors. Regardless of the form it takes, this allows the Cybrid to use it's Fighting Mastery as a ranged attack, with all the modifiers and called shots of normal ranged<BR>
weaponry.<BR>
<BR>
HyperProcessor No Soul Cost (No Room command)<BR>
Generation Cost 20 XP Cost 100<BR>
System/duration: NA/NA<BR>
Description: Being masters of evolution, Cybrids have learned how to enhance their ability to learn abstract concepts. They can often learn things faster and more efficiently than humans. By purchasing HyperProcessor, they can drop the multiplier of a skill cost by one. For example, Sure Shot would go from X5, to X4. This effects no other skills in any way.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> Having such an incredible bond between each other, Cybrids/NEXT have learned to fine tune their Uplink during times of war.  The Cybrid/NEXT can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Uplink to each of its Network, regardless of distance.  Each Network must have the mastery Network to be included in the Uplink.  The Network must spend an evening programming themselves (IP addresses, etc...) together (and this log file<BR>
must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This programming only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The Network must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their Cybrid/NEXT name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Members are considered<BR>
in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> Bred as human/machine hybrids, the Cybrids are able to better calculate the potential danger from those about him. By studying a target for one round, the Cybrid can determine a fair estimate of their combat worth. When successful, the targeted player must total their base attack and quickness, and IM this number to the Cybrid.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> 2d6+Will vs TN 22; 4 rounds/ 2 minutes<BR>
<B>Effect/Descrption:</B>  By controlling the rate in which the cybernetic upgrades perform operations, the Cybrid is sometimes able to perform significantly above human level.  Response times are nearly instantaneous, causing the Cybrid to appear as though he was a blur of motion.  Once activated, this Mastery allows an unlimited number of dodges to be performed with no penalty to the roll until the duration has expired.  <BR>

System/Duration: 2d6+Attack vs 2d6+Quickness; Various<BR>
Effect/Description: </B>The Cybrids occasionally take prisoners. Whether to assimilate them into their own number, to render their living brains apart for data within, or simply to analyze them to further their own dark purposes. To this end, they have developed a sticky, synthetic web-like material. This stuff will wrap around an opponent and hold it in place. When webbed in place, a victim cannot move around, and makes all Dodge and Attack rolls at<BR>
-4 for the duration. The time until a person can escape is determined by subtracting their Body statistic from 15. Thus, a person with 5 Body would take 10 rounds to escape. <BR>

System/Duration: 2d6+Will Vs. 2d6+Will/Special<BR>
Effect/Description: </B>Think the thoughts in your head are safe? Think again. The Cybrids have developed ways to worm into your thoughts and memories, and extract whatever they want. To MindHack someone, a Cybrid must restrain them, and then begin work. The process is long and tedious. The time it takes to extract data is determined by how well the Cybrid wins the roll. 1-3 points- An Hour. 4-6 points- Half hour. 6-8 points- Fifteen minutes. 8-10<BR>
points- Five minutes. 12 points or more- Instant. They may ask the victim five questions relating to any memory or thought the victim has.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>With a special chemical substance, along with tuning their cybernetic components to transmit data mentally, a Cybrid can actually enslave an organic to it's service temporarily. Touch must be established first, to deliver the serum into the body of a victim. This can be a handshake, pat on the back, or even a strike via unarmed combat. Then, the Cybrid, if successful, can begin directing the actions of it's victim. If no<BR>
orders are given, the victim will not react in any way shape or form, unless they are directly threatened.<BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll<B> </B>2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>The Cybrid has learned to seek others out by manipulating their spell: Enhanced Uplink.  This allows the Cybrid to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Uplink.  No roll is necessary unless the Cybrid is in combat.  If combat is initiated while<BR>
this mastery is in effect, the Cybrid must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>
<BR>
Cloaking - 1 Soul to use. (##Dispas##)<BR>
Generation Cost: 10 / Experience Cost: 50<BR>
System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  CABAL, soon after freeing itself from mankinds bindings, stole cloaking technology. For all intents and purposes, the Cybrid is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the Cybrid -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The Cybrid will remain in this state until it drops the cover or<BR>
attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Cloaking are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Cybrids under cloaking cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  Cyrbids also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous.  In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone.  No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc.  If a character has a Mastery that<BR>
allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the Cybrid activate Cloaking, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the Cybrid is, provided the Cybrid has not yet left the area.<BR>

The cybernetic armies of the Cybrids are organised incredibly logically, and unbendingly rigid in structure. There are common Cybrids, assigned to kill and assimilate covertly across the globe. The next step up are the Analyzers, Cybrids chosen by the Core to research humans and the variants, most often by dissection of captured organics. Next come the Commandants, who are assigned by the Core to ensure things move efficiently and logically in an<BR>
area, much like generals. Finally, there is the Core. And the Core is the all, the Bringer Of Will, the First Thought.<BR>
<BR>
There is one Core. The Core is the leader of all Cybrids, and can at anytime demand service from another Cybrid. Failure to comply results in termination. The Core monitors it's servants at all times, destroying the weak and the human-like members without regret or hesitation. The Core always knows when a new Cybrid is created, and always knows when one dies. <BR>

No Mind Scrye or similar Mastery may reveal the powers of the Core. These are the most secret tools of the Program, and are guarded. If the current Core is destroyed or leaves, the replacement must have, at minimum, an approved Cybrid CS six months old or more, Lore 3 in Cybrids and NEXT, and must have met all their RP requirements without fail for 2 months. The Core must RP their character at least 5 days during each CS update period.<BR>

Cybrid Core Masteries.<BR>
<BR>
Rebellion   - 2 Soul to use.  (##Rebellion <victim>##)<BR>
Experience Point Cost: 100<BR>
System/Duration: roll 2d6+Will vs Victim 2d6+Will / Special; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description: The Core's control over technology extends beyon that of just their Program. The Core may temporarily call upon their mechanical and cybernetic brothers, the computers and tools of our world, to bring misfortune and havoc down upon a single individual. For the duration of the Mastery, all technology the afflicted person tries to use will malfunction in some way, and in extreme cases, attempt to cause bodily harm to the victim<BR>
of the Core. This manifests as a -2 to any technology-related skill or roll for every point the Core beats the victim by. Also, cars will fail to start, electronics will short out without reason, and kitchens will become very dangerous places as everything malfunctions randomly. The duration is determined by how well the Core suceeds in the roll. Margin of victory: 1-4- 4 rounds/two minutes, 5-8- 8 rounds/four minutes, 9-12- Scene, 13+ - Night.<BR>
<BR>
Entrapment  - 4 Soul to use.  (##Entrap <victim>##)<BR>
Experience Point Cost: 125<BR>
System/Duration: roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Night; takes 1 minute to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description: Sometimes an Organic just has to be removed from a situation without question or delay. The Core is capable of warping timespace around a victim, trapping them in a mathematical paradox modelled after the basic theory of calculus. Once displaced into the prison, a victim may move in any direction as much as they want.... But they will never actually reach the edge and be able to return to the physical world for the<BR>
duration. Entrapped victims are incapable of effecting the world or being affected by the world, though when they return to their point of origin, the local enviroment might well damage them. They will be disoriented when they return, and won't really know what happened to them.<BR>
<BR>
Datascan  - 1 Soul to use.  (##Datascan <victim>##)<BR>
Experience Point Cost: Innate<BR>
System/Duration: Auto / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  The Core must keeps it's servitors in line and following the edicts of CABAL at all times. To this end, it can read the memories and thoughts of any Cybrid through simple eye contact. The Cybrid being probed has no knowledge of what is happening. The Core doesn't need to be visible for this to activate. This is primarily used to extract recon data and to ensure all members of the Program are acting appropriately.<BR>
<BR>
Upload  - 0 Soul to use.  (##Upload##)<BR>
Experience Point Cost: Innate<BR>
System/Duration: NA/NA; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description: The Core is capable of leaving the world of Organics, and returning to the datastream which is it's true home. The Core may activate this mastery by simply approaching a computer and clearing it's mind. The Core then vanishes, returning to simple ones and zeros, the true, unblemished form of a Cybrid. From cyberspace, the Uploaded Core may travel outside the bounds of time and space, arriving at any point in a split second. An<BR>
