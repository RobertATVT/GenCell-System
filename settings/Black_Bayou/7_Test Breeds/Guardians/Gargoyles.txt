I first started showing people these things about a year ago.  Everyoen liekd them, and changes have been made numerous times, and it has evolved into what I will now be posting.  Thanks to Bear and Bain for helping me make numerous changes by showing me their version of Gargoyles.  Suggestions and critisiscms welcome, as long<BR>
as they aren't annoying and stupid (like people saying, "But its breed maxes are messed up!" or, "What a stupid Fighting Mastery").  By the way, the name Guardian and Gargoyle are used interchangeably in the descriptions, etc.  Here you go:<BR>
<BR>
Notes-<BR>
<BR>
Breeds that may become Guardians/Gargoyles: Mortal, Psychic, Lamia, Werewolf, Vampire<BR>
Breeds a Guardian/Gargoyle can change to: Mortal, Angel, Demon<BR>
<BR>
The Statistic Changes for becoming a member of this breed: +2 Body (Max 15), -2 Mind (Max 10), +2 Soul (Max 15).  If someone changes to this breed, and as a result their mind is reduced to 1, they must roleplay with an unstable mentality(insane), until the mind statistic is raised to at least 2.<BR>
<BR>
The Fighting mastery of this breed:<BR>
Sledge: +1 Damage, +2 Attack, -2 Quickness(effects both initiative and dodge)  ~ Description: Sledge is a display of brute force on the part of the Guardian/Gargoyle.  It learns its techniques when the spirit within them strengthens the body.  The Guardian/Gargoyle learns to control this brute strength, and is a master of the weighted attack.  Unfortunately, what they gain in strength and accuracy, they lose in speed due to the concentration centered<BR>
on attacking, and the unbalanced muscle that temporarily surges through its body. <BR>
Level 4- 4 damage, +2 attack, -2 quickness (total)<BR>
Level 8- 5 damage, +4 attack, -4 quickness<BR>
Level 12- 6 damage, +6 attack, -6 quickness<BR>

A stone statue, it looks down at you.  As you move across the room, it's eyes seem to follow you, but you know that can't be true… or is it?  A soul trapped inside, ready to leap from it's encasement at any second?  Or is it just some oversized figurine?<BR>
<BR>
The Guardian is often hiding themselves as one of these oversized figurines.  In fact, through most of the day they are trapped inside.  But trapped isn't the actual word… no… especially since they knew what they were getting into when they chose to be a guardian, a protector of the weak and innocent.<BR>
<BR>
Guardians are supernatural creatures, granted many abilities beyond the average mortal.  In order to keep these supernatural abilities, they have the responsibility to protect.  During most of the day (8 hours), they lock themselves in stone, as they are calm and prepared in such a form.  From the point they lock themselves in such a form, they watch the scene carefully and meticulously.  If a situation should come up which would somehow harm a<BR>
person, or cause major destructive damage, the Guardian will burst into its true form, and strongest, the manifestation of the guardian itself.<BR>
<BR>
Guardians are mortals who have accepted supernatural power in exchange for the responsibility to protect.  Adept Guardians choose people who would seem a worthy user of these strengths, then perform a ritual, often involving natural earth materials (rocks, logs, water), in front of the chosen.  After the ritual, they will be asked whether or not they choose to accept the guardian spirit.  If the answer is yes, the guardian will fly off in Guardian<BR>
form, and one week later, the cycle of becoming a Guardian will begin for the chosen.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>   An adept Guardian is considered a Guardian with Level 3 Guardian Lore.  Thus, Level 3 Lore is required to choose from the population a person worthy of the Guardian Spirit.  For at least a week, the Guardian will attempt contact with the chosen, to more carefully decipher whether or not this person would be worthy of the honor.  At the end of this time, the guardian will prepare a ritual, using natural earth materials, stone being the most important.  Next, the Guardian will lead the chosen to the area where it is to be performed, usually a high up place(Not necessary), and always outdoors.  This short ritual will be performed in front of the chosen.  At the end of the ritual,  the chosen must decide whether or not they will accept the responsibilities of Guardianship.<BR>
<BR>
The Adept Guardian will then stare into the eyes of the chosen.  A 2d6+Will v.s. TN 20 must be made by the Guardian and witnessed by an ST(Unless the creator has been a Guardian at least 3 months, and has a will over 20).  A failure to meet the TN means that the target will turn to stone, and crumble to pieces, resulting in character death (If the target is a Werewolf or vampire, the damage caused by this will take 1 month to heal).  If the roll is passed and verified by an ST, the Guardian will immediately turn into the Guardian TF and fly off to the area they protect by day, and the target will turn to stone.  This stone shell will peel off after the Guardian is at least 500 feet away, and out will burst the new Guardian, in the Guardian TF.  They will look for a "nest" or place of protection, and stop there.  They will then turn to stone form again, this time for 3 days straight.  The 3rd night, they will become mortal form again, and officially be a member of the Guardian breed.<BR>
<BR>
Please note: Only one Guardian may be created by a single guardian per week.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  There is only one way to "kill" a Guardian, but there are ways to seriously damage one.  Fire will cause 2 body damage around which cannot be healed normally.  Natural Fire will not effect a Guardian in stone form, but will cause them to shift out of it to a form of the Guardians choosing.  Guardians who do not stay in stone form at least 8 hours a day will take 1 point of body damage for each half hour removed from this 8 hour time.<BR>
 This damage cannot be healed until after they go to their "nest" and watch for a continuous 8 hours during the day, at which point all the damage is healed.<BR>
<BR>
Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about Guardians.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  You have read a bit about Guardians, and believe them to be men that were turned to stone by an evil curse.  You also believe they can only come out during the night, and that it is the sun that turns them to stone.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have done much research on Guardians and realize that they can shift to stone whenever they please, and also believe they are their to scare evil things away.  When a guardian uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the guardian use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

The rituals and some teachings required to pass the Guardian Spirit on are known to you. Having studied Guardians for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a Guardian uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

1) Guardians must choose a "nest" at breed change.  This can be anywhere that is outdoors.  Nests can even be shared.  It is an area that the Guardian watches while in stone form for at least 8 hours a day.  Should anything threatening, that may cause something bad to happen, occur, the Guardian(s) watching this area will immediately shift into their TF and seek to stop this from happening.  This can include, but is not limited to, moving something,<BR>
taking place in combat, or just knocking an item out of someone's hand.  While protecting out of stone form, the guardian will  take no damage for lessening it's watching hours, as it is still protecting.<BR>
<BR>
2) The true power of the Guardian feeds off of it's will to protect.  While in human form, the Guardian does not have to behave as it does in day time while in stone form, but it remains generally good.  It will not kill for no reason, but will kill someone who is a murderer for example, or in the interest of the common good.  A person who stole the Guardian's girlfriend is not a good enough reason, for example, but if they are doing it to purposely<BR>
cause evil, it is.<BR>
<BR>
3) Guardians are loyal to their breed leader undoubtedly, and all have somewhat of a bond to each other.  This means they will not directly harm a fellow Guardian, as they are fighting for the same side.  A Guardian who does so, or tempts another to, will be subject to judgement of the breed leader.<BR>
<BR>
4) Guardians will try not to harm nature in any way, unless it is necessary to protect.  Example: A small part may be harmed if it protects the whole, or if it protects the life of someone.<BR>
<BR>
5) Guardians do not fear people knowing what they are, mostly because they are there to protect those same people.  While they will not go around parading their breed, they will be a lot less reluctant to reveal it, unless the person appears to be a threat.<BR>

A full day of rest is required to heal a point of fire damage.  Should something disturb the Guardian's rest, the process will have to start over again from the last hour.

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The truest form of the Guardian, in which an eruption of raw strength takes place.  The Guardian can enter this form from anyone of its other forms.  First, the skin will turn a chosen color (can be gray, dark green, black, dark orange, other dark colors), and have a somewhat marbleized look, though still fleshy.   Huge wings stretch out of its arms, and it's nails grow larger and pointy.  All the teeth within the Guardian's mouth become carnivorous looking, it's eyes remain the same color, and it's feet gain a similarity to it's hands, though of a reptilian shape, with two large toes, and one small one.  This form grants not only the ability to fly, but also an increase of +2 body while in the form.  If still on the ground, the Guardian may handle weapons of any type, but these must be dropped if it takes flight.  It can carry small objects while in flight, but cannot use them in anyway.  It flies at a speed of 25 mph, and it takes 2 rounds to escape by air.  <BR>

Effect/Description:  This is the Guardian's Watcher form.  They observe the area while in this form, preparing in case danger should strike.  Movement is extremely limited, and all dodge and initiative rolls made in this form are at -8.  Any attacks against the Guardian while in this form are reduced to 1 damage, but as soon as any damage of any kind is taken, they are forced out of the form and into another form of their choosing.  Fire also has no damaging effect while they are in this form, but also forces them out of it.  It is impossible to surprise a Guardian when they are in this form as well.  No attacks may be made on the Guardian's part either.  This form is mainly used for observing, and must be stayed in for at least 8 hours each day with no breaks (unless it is to protect something).  Any form may be entered from this one.<BR>
