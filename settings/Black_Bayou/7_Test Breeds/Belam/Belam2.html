</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>The Belam are an honorable breed, protecting those who are innocent and avenging those innocents that have been slain in brutal fashions or had that innocence removed by some diabolic means.  When a Belam uses a Mastery they tap into the spiritual realm that infuses their innate duality.  <BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
For most Belam mastery use, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting, or drawing a mystic Sigil in the air, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.  Some Belam Masteries require Forced Eye Contact, ranges are described in the combat section of the rulebook.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  An Anima can see the auras of those around them and with the above roll can decipher the meanings of these with relative ease.  With this power the Anima can determine the emotional state of the person he is looking at and can tell certain things such as if they are lying or if they have any mental disabilites or the general nature of the character.  Breeds and other such information cannot be determined.  When this ability is used successfully you may IM the other player and ask them one question about either their emotional state, if they are "touched" or their general disposition (hateful, evil, good natured, foregiving, lustful, etc..)<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When this Mastery is purchased it is seen that the Belam ascends in it's spirituality.  The Belam now gains an incredible natural healing ability like unto most immortal breeds.  Any wound caused to the Belam will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds from fire or Runes heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Range of Effect:</B> Self<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Belam are intrinsic watchers and protectors, standing silent vigil over those they guard.  With this ability the Belam can diffuse the opacity of their flesh leaving only the color of spirit, nothing.  Though solid in this form the Belam is effectively invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the Belam -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The Belam can maintian this form for great peiods of time and it will only drop should they do so by their own will, attack someone, or are in some way attacked.  Attacks or Forced Eye Contact made while under the cover of the Cloak are granted a +5 bonus for surprise, though the illusion will immediately drop.  While a Belam is cloaked they cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  This mastery takes a great deal of concentration and while it is in effect no mastery may be enacted.  Masteries that are previously in effect may be maintaint.  No Aiming, Sure Shot, etc. is allowed while under the Cloak.   If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the Belam cloak themselves, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the Belam is, provided the Belam has not yet left the area.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>In the natural world, animals and most other mammals see larger creatures as a threat.  While the Belam uses this ability the victim feels uneasy and disconcerted, the victim isn't "afraid" of the Belam, but they sense an unwavering aura of power around them.  This makes most people unsettled and while under the effects of this mastery the Victim (if the roll succeeds) will be at a -2 to all Will and Attack rolls against the Belam. <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> The Belam has learned to seek others out by expanding on their ability of Whispers.  This allows the Ancien to communicate via Whispers to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +2 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak, or Far Whispers.  No roll is necessary unless the Belam is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the Belam must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.  The Belams speaks the whisper, which cannot be overheard as the spirits take the spoken message to the target.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Range of Effect:</B>  Self<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Frequently a Belam will be forced into battle, either to protect, or to avenge.  When this occurs the Belam may call upon the Spirit World around him and summon forth great armor to protect him.  This armor keeps them from harm and deflects all but the mightiest blows.  This armor manifests around the Belam as an ornate suit of armor taking the resemblance of his chosen Spirit Animal.  This Armor will absorb 1 point of damage from all attacks made against the Belam.  (Damian shoots the Belam in the chest as he runs away, pistols normally do 3 Body damage, but while this is in effect the Belam would only take 2 Body damage).  This mastery may only be used once per night.  After the duration the Belam may choose to keep this active by spending an additional Soul point after Inits are determined.<BR>

<B>Range of Effect:</B> LOS<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Belam is capable of speaking directly to the target.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within line of sight in order to communicate in this fashion.  Whispers can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.  The communication is heard as if the user is next to the target whispering the message.  This cannot be overheard by any means.<BR>

<B>Range of Effect:</B> None<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> As there exists an incredible bond between the manipulators of Spirit, Belam have learned to fine-tune Whispers during times of war.  The Belam can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Whisper to its Gathering, regardless of distance.  Each member of the Gathering must have the mastery Whispers of The Gathering to be included in the Whisper.  The gathering must spend an evening attuning their spirits together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The gathering member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their gathering name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the gathering member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Gathering members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>
