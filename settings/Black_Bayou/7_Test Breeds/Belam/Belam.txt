Ages past, during times of legend men walked amongst Sorcerers, Angels, Demon, and other beings mystical and wonderous.  Those times held many a myth and legend, tales of powerful God and Godesses, and fables of great men.  In those ages new powers were created and men tinkered with things they knew nothing of.  It was in this age that the mighty Belam were created.  <BR>
<BR>
Meant as a cruel expiriment or joke nobody to this day knows, however a powerful Magi by the name of Alexande impregnated a woman with a magical seed conjured and fashioned out of the very fabric of spirits.  Not truly thinking that the pregnancy would carry through, Alexande left the woman to her own devices.  He was too skeptical of his own ability and faltered in his belief.  Unknown to him the magic that held the seed together and brought it to the world remained true and as a result a child was born.<BR>
<BR>
The childs name was Belam, and the circumstances of his birth and his young life were no different than any other.  As he gew however, his unique nature became known.  When Belam was thirteen seasons passed his growth began to speed and his size rapidly changed.  By the time Belam was sixteen seasons he was well over three cubits tall, taller than most full grown men.  His growing finally stopped when he reached eighteen seasons and by this time he was an alarming four cubits in height, and legends spread about this giant youth.  <BR>
<BR>
Belam became a great figure in his small village, able to lift things and tend to chores and tasks that would take four or five other men to accomplish.  He developed an an affinity for animals and spirits surrounding the world and was seen much like a mystic or shaman, setting spirits to rest and calming animals.  Long was his name praised and lifted in prayer song and legend, his line never diminished and his seed bred true and complete throughout the ages, to this day the Belam are men of great stature and strength, and having a unique affinity for spirits and things mystical.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>The Joining: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>A Belam may only be created through birth or by means of a unique passing ritual.  This ritual is one of rather bizarre means but must be done to pass the semi ethereal qualities to a potential Belam.  The first step is done by painting sigils across the body of the newcomer in a mixture of Lions Blood, Powdered Roots for Strength, and the blood of his creator.  These sigils usually take the form of either runes for strength, or pictograms of various animals (mostly Lions, Bear, and Wolves) that represent strength and ferocity.  The second step isn't as easy as the first.  The Body paint used on the newcomer induces a trancelike state in which the victim will be sent to the land of spirits to find their strength and devour it.  This takes shape in many ways, some go through a more Native American Vision Quest in which they hunt a Bear without weapons and defeat them, or some similar task that involves great displays of prowess.  During this process the spirit world invades the body of the newcomer and saturates them as it does the rest of his kind.  While this infusion occurs the body will resist and the new Belam must make a roll of 2d6+Body vs. TN 14 or they will die from the stress of the ordeal.  If the roll is made successfully, the Belam will pass their ordeal and immediately pass out.  When the awake they will notice some change in height, and over the course of the next week they will grow rapidly, usually making the difference between their original height and close to seven foot to seven foot six inches.  During this time the Belam will be in severe pain and will have a -2 penalty to all rolls for that time period.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Please note:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> only one Belam may be created by any single Player per week.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Death:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  A member of this breed can only be killed by the use of faith and level three in their Lore.  However, there are a couple of ways to seriously injure a Belam.  Mandrake can cause serious damage to a Belam when it is properly prepared (please see Belam Lore Level 2 below).  Regular fire will cause 2 points of damage per round the Lamia is exposed to it.  Fire wounds can be deadly, but can also cause serious damage since they take twice as long to heal normally.  See Healing below for more details.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Means of Recovery:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> A Belam will regain 1 point of body every three days.  So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or a little more than a week.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e. a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, stiffness or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.  Wounds created by either fire or Mandrake take twice as long to heal than normal.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Please note: If you have the following level of lore, this is what your character thinks they know about the Belam.  Some are fact and some are myth.  If it is not listed in the information above or specifically stated below, it is myth.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>  You have watched many Hollywood movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Stories in various mythical and religious texts tell about great giant men that storm through villages and eating children.  Most giants you hear about are disgustingly large creatures with a bend for evil and kidnapping.  Greed surrounds these creatures and they tend to mass large amoutns of wealth.  One other legend states that the blood of a Lamb will cause grievous wounds to a Belam. Of course, you don't know all the stories do you?<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Rune of Warding:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Runes are used in various cultures to divine and see spirits.  Throwing Runes is a divination method used through most of the Nordic lands, and this method has passed as their people have moved to other lands.  However the uses of these Runes take on many aspects.  One of these is the ability to Ward creatures from the wielder.  The character must brandish the Rune and concentrate, focusing their faith through the object to ward them off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. The Belam's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character beats the Belam's roll they are successfull and the Belam must flee the scene for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the Belam from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions that the Belam may make are those that will allow them to escape quicker.  Should there be no place to run, the Belam will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If this attempt fails however, the Belam can ignore any further warding attempts by the same character for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of warding enrages the Belam and they will attack the character as their next action however they are able.  You may not ward a member of your own breed.<BR>

You have scoured through ancient religious texts and myths and fables, though most of this information is false.  You know believe that Lambs blood if entered into the bloodstream of a Belam will kill them as it strips the strength from them.  You believe that the Belam can turn into massive creatures wielding clubs and great axes, storming through the woods and attacking small towns.  Having studied them for a while you have learned of some of their more subtle abilites and magiks.  When a Belam uses a Mental Mstery with you as the target within Line of Sight, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs a TN:20.  It doesn't matter if  if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from the attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if Any) for that Mastery.  (Masteries that require the Belam to use Will, Mind, or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Rune of Wounding:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B> As Warding above runes are used for many purposes through many cultures, and one of these is the ability to cause harm to supernaturals.  It takes 10 minutes to empower a rune for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must engrave the rune in clay made of purified earth and mixed with Lambs Blood. The roll to empower the Rune is 2d6 +Soul +Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  To attack with the rune, the attacker must make a normal hand to hand attack on the Belam.  Only 3 attacks worth of Runes may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered Rune may only be used by the individual that created it.  If an attack is successful, the Runes suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The ABelam must heal the damage as if it was caused by fire.  That would mean each point of damage would take 1 week.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the Belam heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.<BR>

The powers and rituals used to create another Belam are known to you.  Having studied Belam for so long you have picked up and know most of their powers.  When a Belam uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN:20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and it's effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that Mastery.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Sight Recognition: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>There are two methods of identifying a Belam by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Belam, which happens to be (  ).  If you wish to identify the Belam as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Belam, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Belam transform either to or from (  ).  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Belam. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Slayer Rune: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>To kill a Belam, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the spiritual nature of the Belam.  The Belam are susceptible to Lambs Blood which eats the spiritual connection that gives the Belam their unique strength and stature.  The slayer must inscribe the Rune of Slaying on the Belams forehead and chest after he has been incapacitated.  As the slayer concentrates and pulls their faith around the runes the blood sinks into the flesh of the Belam and begins eating at its spirit.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, focusing it on blood as it is fired.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully - no roll is required for inscribing the Rune on the Belams body.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the blood will kill the Belam instantly as the spirit is forced from the blood of the Belam and they die instantly.  The empowerment does not last any longer than the round following the empowerment and if the roll fails it will not kill the Belam.  No character may attempt to empower a killing item more than once an hour.  The Belam will appear to be mortal after it has died.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
1) Due to the partial spirit nature of the Belam they may never become any spirit related breed (Angel, Demon, Anima, etc..).<BR>
<BR>
2) Belam are by nature an honorable breed, and should a fight occur around them they will do what they can to keep it fair.  Anytime the Belam are encountered with a confrontation they must make a 2d6+Will vs.TN: 20 to resist protecting the victim.  Belam have a high sense of justice and will fight to protect someone falsely accused of a crime with every ounce of strength they have.  Also, the Belam can never turn their backs on someone in need, even if it means putting themselves in danger.  This also requires a 2d6+Will roll vs. TN:24.<BR>
<BR>
3) The Belam must once a week get with his natural self, this involves calling animals to him and communing with his natural surroundings.  This must be roleplayed for 30 minutes per week in the main room and witnessed by the host.  This RP must be posted in the ST's lair (Though it can be cross posted in one other folder for points).  These posts must be included on your Character sheet for each update (all four).<BR>

While they are communing the Spirit Animal of the Belam (This animal is chosen during the Belams creation) visits them and the other animals watch over him as he rebuilds his spirit.  While in this meditation the Belam will regain 1 lost Soul per 15 minutes of time spent, which must be RP'd in the main room.  If there are any PC's in animal form while the Belam is in communion (Within 50' feet) they must make a roll of 2d6+Will vs. the Belams 2d6+Will or they begin taking a more friendly attitude towards the Belam.<BR>

When this mastery is used on person (or Object) the Belam transfers his essence (soul) into them which repairs damage done.   For every point above the TN above the Belam gets he will "mend" a point of lost body to the person or object.  Each point healed costs one point of soul and the amount isn't controllable.  The Belam may very well be rendered unconcious as his spirit flows into them, This will occur if the Belam ever drops below zero Soul.  The Belam cannot control the amount of points that are healed, and the target gains only those points to his Body stat and no higher.  (See Object Body Levels later on)<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
For most Belam mastery use, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting, or drawing a mystic Sigil in the air, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.  Some Belam Masteries require Forced Eye Contact, ranges are described in the combat section of the rulebook.<BR>

The Belam now gains an incredible natural healing ability like unto most immortal breeds.  Any wound caused to the Belam will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds from fire or Runes heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Belam are intrinsic watchers and protectors, standing silent vigil over those they guard.  With this ability the Belam can diffuse the opacity of their flesh leaving only the color of spirit, nothing.  Though solid in this form the Belam is effectively invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the Belam -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The Belam can maintian this form for great peiods of time and it will only drop should they do so by their own will, attack someone, or are in some way attacked.  Attacks or Forced Eye Contact made while under the cover of the Cloak are granted a +5 bonus for surprise, though the illusion will immediately drop.  While a Belam is cloaked they cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  This mastery takes a great deal of concentration and while it is in effect no mastery may be enacted.  Masteries that are previously in effect may be maintaint.  No Aiming, Sure Shot, etc. is allowed while under the Cloak.   If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the Belam cloak themselves, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the Belam is, provided the Belam has not yet left the area.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>In the natural world, animals and most other mammals see larger creatures as a threat.  While the Belam uses this ability the victim feels uneasy and disconcerted, the victim isn't "afraid" of the Belam, but they sense an unwavering aura of power around them.  This makes most people unsettled and while under the effects of this mastery the Victim (if the roll succeeds) will be at a -2 to all Will and Attack rolls against the Belam. <BR>

<B>Range of Effect:</B>  Self<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Frequently a Belam will be forced into battle, either to protect, or to avenge.  When this occurs the Belam may call upon the Spirit World around him and summon forth great armor to protect him.  This armor keeps them from harm and deflects all but the mightiest blows.  This armor manifests around the Belam as an ornate suit of armor taking the resemblance of his chosen Spirit Animal.  This Armor will absorb 1 point of damage from all attacks made against the Belam.  (Damian shoots the Belam in the chest as he runs away, pistols normally do 3 Body damage, but while this is in effect the Belam would only take 2 Body damage).  This mastery may only be used once per night.  After the duration the Belam may choose to keep this active by spending an additional Soul point after Inits are determined.<BR>

<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>When creating a new Gathering, there are a few things that should be considered.  Isle Voletta is a good sized island, but the city of Voletta is not that large.  Belam depend on large amounts of nature to commune with and seek out places with higher crime rates as those places hold more need for them.  Therefore the size of the island determines how many Belam will gather to one place.  Voletta is large enough for one single gathering of up to 13 members plus the Patron, if a Belam attempts to bring over a 14th the attempt will automatically fail, seeing as the Patron cannot spread the spirit to encompass anymore Followers.  <BR>
<BR>
There is only one Patron in any given are which all the other Belam answer to for guidance and supoprt, this area is usually a city and some have a much larger gathering than others.<BR>
<BR>
Either way, to create the Gathering, the player of the Patron must submit a Breed Leader Request to</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <A HREF="mailto:AntBBMail?subject=Belam Breed Leader Request">ANT BB Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Once approved, the Patron will have access to the patron mastery list and have their own page set up in the main boards.
