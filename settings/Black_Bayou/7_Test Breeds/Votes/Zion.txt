</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>through carefulk consideration (sorry i too so long....i wasn't really looking at the breeds you gave me close enough to feel I could decide)...<BR>

Anima. Except more like the revenant breed I gave you with Tokens like the revenant had and some of the same qualities. lots of potential here. Albeit, I hate the name..sounds too much like a Tool Album.<BR>
<BR>
AT'yall. I love Atlantis. It's fresh. It's new. I've never seen it before in an RP game, (D&D doesn't count, neither does Rifts).<BR>
<BR>
Shifters... I choose this one, but there are a lot of ooc potentials that need to be watched. If I could only choose 3, I'd ignore this one completely because it eliminates one of the powers the demons has and makes an entire breed based off of it.<BR>
<BR>
Schicksal. I love the concept. not much to go on...but, still, genetics is my forte'<BR>
<BR>
I am also going to vote for the Shadow breed and I will CC this to bearof bb if you have anyq uestions about the shadows. They are the bets breed I have ever had the pleasure of playing against and scared the crap out of me when I did so, Since I established 3 post series based on this now nonexistant breed and incorporated them with my character zion, my revenant Burton jones and even an alternate future and a second world domninated by them somewhere out there. This would be my fourth vote instead of the shifters, if possible.<BR>
