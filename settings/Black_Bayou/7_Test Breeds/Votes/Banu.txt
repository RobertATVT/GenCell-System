</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0">1) Gargoyles - (My version) I think gameplay wise they open a door that's been shut for sometime now.<BR>
<BR>
2) Geomancer- From what I saw it was RP heavy, with only RP inate masteries. I think the title name probably needs to be changed but from what I'm given their good enough.<BR>
<BR>
(I have to pick four...damn)<BR>
<BR>
3) Shifters-Oddly enough I like them. I see untold potential in them RP wise if given the chance to be reworked with what it is already there. Minus the ability to turn into inanimate objects which hurts this breed in my opinion, there is something solid to them.<BR>
<BR>
4) Anima- I chose this because you asked for four and I disliked it less then the others. Sorry but that's how I feel..their reverants, and I really didn't care for the way they were done originally...that's just me.<BR>
<BR>
Honorable Mention: Pokemon...from what I see it's about as good as anything else that's left.<BR>
