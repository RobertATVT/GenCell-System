</B>Government agents have a number of different origins.  From the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Central Intelligence Agency to the highly secret National Security Agency.  These organizations are deeply rooted with sub-organizations so clouded in secrecy that they often don't recognize each other in the field.  All Player Character government agents begin as a low ranking field agent for whichever agency they belong to.  Also, you never know how many ex-agents there are lurking in the shadows...just what is their angle?<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Empathy</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Empathy <target>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>	The Stiles Family was prominant in American government.  Well.. maybe not in the legislative or executive process, but it all started with Earl Stiles, Jr.  He joined the FBI when it first began, and got to work beside J. Edgar Hoover, and other important law-enforcement figures of the time.  Earl Stiles, Jr. retired in the early 1960s, but another Stiles would soon replace him.<BR>
	James Stiles went into the FBI in order to follow his father's footsteps.  Although he did very little of historical importance, James Stiles was quite a respected man.  He was a man full of dignity, and honor, and other good qualities that make a good human being.  He was a model agent, and.. after he retired of field work, he became one of the top instructors at Quantico.<BR>
	Jeffrey M. Stiles, the son of James Stiles, and his wife Anne.  Born August 1, 1970, Jeff Stiles was destined to become an Agent, and to be quite frank, he did.  The Stiles name was very influential with the Bureau, because they had served the Bureau with honor and dignity ever since the beginning of the institution.  After graduating high school, Jeff was accepted to many colleges.  He decided that he would continue the family tradition and go to Quantico to become an agent in the greatest law enforcement agency in the world.. or so his family believed.  Quanitco was a breeze for a man of Jeff's stature.  He became an agent, and he fulfilled the dreams of his father and his grandfather.  Unfortunately, he wouldn't be an agent as long as they had.<BR>
	Being a federal agent was a very prestigious position, but.. all good things must come to an end, or so it would seem.  Jeff resigned his position in July of 1999.  His reasons?  Well.. he didn't have many, but he was tired of the beauracracy that dominated the American government and political system.  It was all a big joke to all those people on Capitol Hill.  And.. Jeff was tired of it, he believed it was time for a change in scenery, so he decided to pack his things, and head to a new town to begin his life anew.<BR>
	Acutally, there was a dark part of Jeff's past that he didn't wish to share with anyone.  And this was a major reason as to why he had to leave the FBI.  You see, the FBI had ways of knowing if a person was different or not.  And well.. Jeff was different.  You see, about a year back, something happened to him.  Something... bad.<BR>
	You see.. Jeff had witnessed something that he couldn't explain.  Something.. some kind of an animal had just ripped some guy to shreds.  It was utterly disgusting, and he had nightmares about it for a long, long time.  Feeling that this would ruin his career, he retired from the Bureau to do other things.  Maybe he would become a small time cop.<BR>
	As a retired agent, he felt that it would be beneficial to him, because he no longer had to inform people of his position in life.  As a career in Voletta, he had no idea what he would do.<BR>
