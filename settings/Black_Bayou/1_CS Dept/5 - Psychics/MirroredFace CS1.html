<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Jean is American, but was born in France on September 16, 1971, At 11:11 am.<BR>
 His mother, died while birthing him, was raised by his father Marcus. His Family moved to France on business 6 years prior to his birth, his father being caught up in the rising computer era for business. He was a programmer, rare in his profession, he was stationed in Paris.<BR>
 <BR>
 It was 11:16 am when his mother was pronounced dead, his father destroyed, and overjoyed, and Jean opening his lungs for only the 60th time. Over months Marcus grew more able to cope with his loss, with the aid of course of Jean. He had no time to cry with a new baby.<BR>
 <BR>
 At about 7 Jean started to get into computers. At 10, he wrote his first program, a virus. He father giggled at the weak virus that would display "poop face" on the screen and eventually delete a database or two before it override itself in the process.<BR>
 <BR>
 Marcus thought the boy should start training for manhood now. So he made Jean do 10 pushups a day, and 20 sit-ups. This went on for a year. On his 11th birthday, Jean received a BB gun, and some primitive programming books.<BR>
 <BR>
 Jean would either be doing homework, shooting birds, or playing on his fathers computer. This grew, Jean received his first riffle at 13 a .22. His dad taught his the value safety around guns, "Treat it as a precious computer Jean, and don't let anyone touch it". Jean did as his father wished. Now moving on to small rodents in the woods and birds. (of course)<BR>
 <BR>
 At 15 Jean received his first PC. Ahh the day has come, victory. It was an apple. Day and night. He was on his precious little prize, clinging to it like a baby to a nipple. Jean was writing programs now, to test himself. Some good, to enhance his computer game pleasures, compression, and all around use. Some bad, to crash systems, hard drives. <BR>
 <BR>
 At 17, Jean went to America, fluent in French and American he was ready for the battle of college. He majored in computer electronics, and a minor in law. He started to becoming in interested into this new thing. The Internet. Ahh his gateway!<BR>
 <BR>
 Uploading! Downloading! Information! Power! Money! All at his finger tips, a computer prodigy, he was good at what he did.<BR>
 <BR>
 23 Now, he went back to visit his father for two months before he headed to Tokyo and their vast technological society to learn more.<BR>
 <BR>
 He went, there at his third week in his apartment, working for a computer company part time and going to night school, he was robbed. He didn't have any of his weapons with him "Damn!" he left that in France so he wouldn't have to deal with customs. He was beaten to an inch of his life.<BR>
 <BR>
 After three weeks in the hospital, his dad hovered above him, as he slipped out of his coma. "He's awake!"<BR>
 <BR>
 His dad was almost crying thinking he had lost his son along with his love. After about an hour of off and on conversation, trying not to push Jean too hard Marcus introduced the man next to him. A short oriental man.<BR>
 <BR>
 This is Cho Sin, and old friend, we were room mates in college. The short man bowed. <BR>
 <BR>
 After six months of non stop working, going to school, and being with Cho on the weekends Jean was exhausted. He had gotten his second degree technical application of computer hardware. Now there was this man, who was teaching him how to fight. This Cho character appearing out of no where. He was tough, he kicked Jean's butt every spar. Jean got better though. Learned to know what to expect.<BR>
 <BR>
 After five years in Asia, and constant night classes, and one too many martial arts classes Jean came back to the America he knew and felt best in, after a brief stop to say hi to dad. Jean went to DC, got a temporary job with a respectable software company. He then logged on his computer, with a sardonic grin on his face. To be taken away......<BR>
 <BR>
 He wanted to move to a no where place, ah what's this? Voletta, an island. Oooh, apartments for sale. Yes, here we go.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
