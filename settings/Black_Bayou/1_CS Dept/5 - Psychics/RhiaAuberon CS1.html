 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  Rhiannon is 5'10", 130lbs., with straight, jet black hair that falls halfway down her back. She has a naturally porcelain like complexion and hazel eyes. She is 25. She dresses mainly in jeans and poet shirts and wears a black lamb's leather trench coat. She is attractive, yet not the typical opinion of gorgeous. She carries herself well, exuding an aura of confidence most of the time.<BR>

    Rhiannon was born and raised in Maryland, leaving to go to Penn State when she was 18 on a scholarship for her writing skills. She had an upper middle class upbringing, her parents; Aaron and Caroline both being teachers in a college prep high school, which she also attended. Always the one to get the straight A's, she never had many friends, and even though she didn't look it, was considered a geek among her peers. Not that it mattered much, her nose was always stuck in a book anyway...for the sheer enjoyment of gaining knowledge. Her favorite author from the time she was a teenager was Anne Rice. Her books, The Vampire Chronicles, fascinated Rhiannon to the point of this almost obsessive lust for finding out all there was to be found about vampires. It was one of her papers in high school on the origins of the legend of the vampire myth that won her the scholarship to Penn State. She graduated there with honors and went on the following year to write a novel about vampires that did fairly well in the bookstores. In the year after that, she sold a few short stories that were published in compilation books. <BR>
       Then something interesting happened. She was visiting a friend from college who now lived in Metarie when she saw an unusual story on a local news channel out of a place called Isle Voletta. Some kind of strange animal maulings. She asked her friend, Karen's, husband about it, as he had lived in the area almost from the time he was a child. And he told her some of the strange folklore surrounding the island and the people that lived there. Rhiannon couldn't believe it. It was almost too good to be true. Of course, Derek thought she was being absolutely silly to even pretend that she believed anything he had told her. But Rhiannon had read enough books and delved into enough history to know that vampires, in some form, did exist. Who knows, maybe she would be lucky enough to find her own Louis, a vampire who would tell their story, share their side with the world. A factual account of probably one of the most understood creatures in both ancient and modern mythology. It was almost too much to ask for.<BR>
