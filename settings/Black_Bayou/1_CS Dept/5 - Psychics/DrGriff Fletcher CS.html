<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

						<B>Physical Description: </B>With a sharply bent nose, and cut facial features, Fletcher had spent his life enjoying his ability to boast resemblance to the Greek statue of Zeus. In his twenty-eighth year, his second as a physchiatrist, his habits are casual and precise, and he can most often be found in either Khaki slacks or a pair of semi-loose blue-jeans, with a white dress shirt tucked in over, and the same old, faded brown sport coat, with patches at the elbows. His physical appearance is hardly intimidating, but unsettling nonetheless. His arms are thin at first glance, but can quickly be discerned to hold coils of sleek muscle, faintly visible while relaxed under the skin, and drastically taut when flexed. His every motion is liquid marble, smooth and calculated, a picture of grace beyond his short years. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

	Having grown up in large, tourist swarmed Harrisburg, Griffin Fletcher had been desensitized to death since his early years. He and his companions spent hours playing games of Spaceman and Alien, (the recent Apollo 13 "Successful Failure" having left a strong impression on them), in which,  more than once, one or more children spent the last minutes of the game playing out detailed death sequences, in which they related aloud the pain they supposedly felt, and illustrated with words, (drawn between labored breaths, of course), their grotesque afflictions and injuries, everything from having been eviscerated to decapitated, with a careless manner. The Forefathers would have been sick. <BR>
	As he grew older, Griffin found himself to be a compassionate person. His friends, and peers, often came to him for advice in the range of troubles that plague young adolescence. By the age of 14, he had acquired a reputation for being a wonderful conversationalist, and many came just to tell him their problems, and carefully ingest his wisdom. It was then that he chose his profession.<BR>
	After graduating at the top of his high school class, he enrolled in nearby Pennsylvania State, with visions of becoming a well known physchiatrist. A Bachelor's in Physchology was quickly earned, followed by a second four year term, in which he gained his Master's, and Ph.D. A few weeks, an appeal to the Pennsylvania Board of Physchiatric Health, and a few dollars sent in the way of persuasion, he was a liscensed Physchiatrist. It felt wonderful.<BR>
	A year went past before his first incident. A patient was talking quietly to him about his childhood problems, and the trouble those created. He was confessing his dependancy on the doctor, and thanking him heartily for his help.<BR>
	Fletcher's first instinct was frightening. He had the sudden urge to completely crush the unfortunate patient, but quelled it quickly. Looking unbelievingly at the man, he glanced carefuly at his watch, and said something about time being up. The Man glanced at his own, and shook his head. No, he said, He had five minutes.<BR>
	This was where Fletcher lost it. Fearing for his, and his patients health, he stood, and started screaming for the patient to leave. The patient grudging did so, after quite a few loud exclamations. <BR>
	It happened more than once. After several of these episodes, he spent months confined in his own space. Unfortunately, his reputation was destroyed. His mental health was detirorating as well, as he found that he had problems keeping his anger in. Reluctantly, he returned to the profession with the few patients who would still take him. To help sooth his nerves, he took their company at his own home, in a lush Den, equipped with a leather sofa for the obviouse reasons.<BR>
	It was here that his first murder was commited. After making an exscuse to stand, he had left the room, found his hunting rifle, returned, and quickly shot his patient between the eyes. The entire process came naturaly, a homicidal blackout in which he felt only serene pleasure. It had been hell to dodge the police in the weeks after, but possible. On the other hand, he was forced to leave Pennsylvania.<BR>
	Voletta comes into play. Like so many others, he had heard of its seclusion and oddities, and went there to tend to his habits in private, and possibly learn more manipulative skills. It was said that a supernatural being known as the <I>Lamia</I> was located in dense population there, a being that relied on its power of mental supremecy to rule its captors. This intrigued him. The move was made quickly, and he stays there happily to the present day, where we find him, living on the coast in peace..<BR>
