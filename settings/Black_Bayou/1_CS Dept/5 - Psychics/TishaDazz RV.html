The prophets of our generation, some mean well, while some don't.  But they have a unique power over us, the gift to sway us, to tell us anything they want to and somehow make us actually believe it.  It's a good thing they're on our side.  They are on our side...right?<BR>

<B>Advantage:</B>  Religious Leaders hold an incredible sway over the community.  Many people hold a solid belief that Religious Leaders can do no wrong.  Obviously this reputation can be tarnished, but until it does, a Religious Leader is almost always believed over someone who is accusing them.  The religious leader receives a +3 to any roll involving their Theology skill.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  Belonging to a Wiccan Coven since birth hasn't been an easy thing.  Being adopted by the entire coven when her father died, her mother lost to her at birth, was even harder. With pagans being persecuted at every turn she had to hide what was within her until she was old enough to defend it.  Which was when she had meet her Sensei.  His charm was evident when she first gazed apon him, puberty just hitting.  As best friends they would often challenged one another.  Thier challenges ranged from games to physical prowess.  Discovering that he too was Wiccan was only an added bonus in her mind and finally apon turning twenty-one she admited that he was her soulmate.  Shortly after their love was consimated he challenged her to a danerous climb.  Never being one to back down from a challenge, Trisha went with a gusto.  Unfortunately for the lovers, she became trapped in a landslide and while she was able to retain her life lost her sight to snowblindness permanately.  After a brief struggle with insanity over the lose of her sight, Stefan and Trisha became inseperable.  He helped her to relay on her other senses.  Once she had adapted her coven saw fit to send her abroad.  They were searching for certain answers and felt that she might  be the key to finding them.  Her undieing faith aids her in many ways, her search it share her inner peace and comfort is great.  She takes each stride in her life carefully, thinking on it as the bidding of her Goddess.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>       Phyllis entered the bedroom laden with clothes.  The light whistle that she had been walking to stilled as she caught sight of Tisha.  With her head tilted to the side and her arms braced on the back of the computer chair Tisha smiled in Phyllis' general direction.<BR>
        "Why have you stopped whistling, Nana?" she asks of Phyllis, her tone soft.<BR>
        With a smile Phyllis places the clothes on the great sleigh bed.  It never stopped amazing her how well Tisha was able to tell who was who in her life.  Before anyone spoke Tisha usually knew who you were and what you were doing as you entered the room.  The girls voice was always soft and warm, like a thick cotton robe that one would wear on a cold winter night.<BR>
          "Well, I saw you standing there looking thoughtful and didn't want to disrupt your musings," she replies in her aged voice.<BR>
           Tisha's head tilts again, this time to the opposite side, as she listens to Nana's words.  Nana had been with Tisha since she was very young.  She had been Tisha's Nanny as an infant and when her parents had died opted to stay on with her.  The fact that she had lost her sight mattered little to the aging woman.  What did matter to her was that Tisha would always need her and for that Phyllis was greatful.  <BR>
          "You might be able to help me actually," Tisha said in her smooth easy going manner.   "Stefan set up that wonderful program so that I could keep my journal on the computer but... well... I can't load it or start the pc without him.  Do you remember how he had done it?"<BR>
           Phyllis had made a special effort to learn all of the things that Tisha might have wanted to do and this was one. Moving beside the girl she pulled the speaker out and clicked on the appropriate programing. <BR>
           "Here you are, sweety," she said moving back to the laundry. "I am placing your shirts that have matches on the same side as the pants that have matches.  Is the right side ok?"<BR>
           Tisha nodded as she put the head set on.  She waited for the few minutes it would take the older woman to settle the remainder of the clothes, listening to her mutter about rearranging after a move.<BR>
           Smiling she started her journal.<BR>
           "Nana has just left and I am speaking into the speaker my a chara has built for me.(a chara is gaelic for dear heart).  He knews that I hate the brail cards and this is a much better way.  I feel at times that I would be lost without him.  Like a firefly to the light so too is my soul drawn to his.  He has the gift of understanding that I could find in no other.  I only pray that one day he will let go of his guilt.<BR>
           "The home that he has bought for us in Volletta is wonderful, and the new servants are getting along well with Nana.  The rooms are spacious with many windows, one of my personal passions.  He hasn't asked me too many questions regarding my choose of settings.  Only accepted that here is were we will be living.  <BR>
             "Truthfully I am not even certain that I fully understand.  What was the Coven thinking?  They gave me leader status within the coven and then sent me here.  What is it that they think that will find?  I know that they want me to search but they have left it vague.  Can the leaf fly straight to it's destination if the wind howls?  I am left wondering.  All I can do is trust in the Goddess and know that she will give me what I need when I need it."<BR>
             Her head tilts slightly as she hears Stefan in the other room clicking away.  Tapping the key she know will end the programing and save it,  she stands.  Slowly making her way down the hall and to her love.<BR>

3) Summary (what you want to happen) </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>During a session of meditation Tisha suddenly discovers that she is able to sense what the people around her are feeling. Her thoughts seem to drift and suddenly she comes to realize that she is broadcasting her thoughts to those around her. Perhaps this latest Solistice unlocked the potential of her mind for her, she does not know. Panic stricken with this overwhelming ability she seeks out Rhiannon only to find that she is gone. With no where else to turn she is forced to focus her thoughts and find a means of controling this herself.<BR>
	Enter Arius Zaven, Rhiannon's teacher senses a new mind emerging from the slumber of the mundane and sensing her distress at this alarming new gift seeks her in turn out.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>

4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Basically, I want to have Arius train Tisha how to use her new abilities. Posts, MR RP as well as a few PR sessions should get this off the ground. Until she learns control it should make for a few interesting rp experiences.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>
