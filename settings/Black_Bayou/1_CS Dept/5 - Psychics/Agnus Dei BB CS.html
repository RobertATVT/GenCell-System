<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  One Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will Vs. TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Agnus stands at the average height of women of her age, and her lithe form enables her to be more agile than many people, giving her the advantage of being nimble.  Though she looks small, Agnus actually has well-developed muscles, formed in such a way of years of training.  Agnus' face is almond-shaped, a pair of large eyes offsetting her small nose and thin, puffed lips.  Her eyebrows curve downward in an eternal scowl of distrust and paranoia, while a mane of crimson hair flow down over her shoulders.  Her body is naturally well-developed as well, curved and seductive like that of a model, despite her attempts to cover up her voluptuous form.  Her skin is tanned from her constant work out in the intense sun.  Trained as a fighter, Agnus wears no loose clothing, so not to get in the way if she were under attack.  She almost always wears a long pair of jeans, with a small T-shirt or tank-top tucked into the jeans.  Her hair is mostly seen tied back in a ponytail swinging from the back of her head.  Agnus wears no jewelry, except for the necklace that holds her ankh talisman and a plain, small gold bracelet that is NEVER seen off of her. (OOC Note: The ankh is the talisman that she focuses her powers through, whereas the bracelet has no magical value--it's purely sentimental)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Agnus was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in one of the slum areas that were barely covered by the police force.  Her hereditary father, known to only three people and kept in a dusty, unused police file in downtown Atlanta, was Anthony Raynor, and her mother Elizabeth Raynor.  Anthony worked as an assembly line worker at a Ford automobile factory, while Elizabeth was a nurse at a nearby hospital.  Her family was a strong Christian family, or as strong as it could be when Anthony was an alcoholic and beat and molested both his wife and his daughter.  Agnus was born with the gift of the psychic, though she didn't know that she possessed it.  Her father always knew something was strange about her as every time he swung a fist at her bruised and bloody face or raped her innocent, battered body, he could hear her young voice crying for help in his mind.  As time went by, Anthony confirmed that she was a freak of nature because of this power, and added that to her many faults he punished her for.  Agnus at first had gone to school all the time to avoid the stinking, meaty hands of her father, but the kids at the school were no different: They taunted her because of her looks, because she was a freak because of her frantic telepathic broadcasting was heard to everyone around her, and they knew her thoughts.  She was poked with sticks, publicly laughed at, and generally was an outcast among the other kids.  Agnus then started going to school less and less, and eventually stopped going all together.<BR>
	Once, when Agnus was nine years old, she was being yet again beaten by her father.  Then, Elizabeth burst into the room wielding a pistol.  An argument ensued, and Elizabeth shot Anthony through the head, killing him almost instantly.  Shocked by her own actions, she turned the gun on herself and committed suicide.  Agnus cowered in the corner until police officers arrived.<BR>
	Agnus was put under the foster care of a wealthy retired CEO of an oil company, Russell Oaks, and his wife, Regina Oaks, who were at the time running a small restaurant called the Cornucopia.  Agnus, when she first arrived, was dazed and frightened beyond belief.  Her new foster father thought that she wouldn't speak because of the incidents that occurred just days before.  As weeks passed by, he thought he heard her voice respond to his answers, but always as if they emanated from between his ears--he was getting senile, he reassured himself.  Then, when he sat and watched Agnus speak to him, in her frightened and timid voice, he noticed her lips moved not at all.<BR>
	Russell had heard of this thing before--this thing called telepathy.  He was dumbfounded as to why she didn't use her voice--he knew she had one, because she'd use it when she was crying, and before she opened up with her mind, she'd open her mouth, as IF to speak, but her eyes would unfocus and her lips would tremble, like she was commanded to never speak.  That was the case, unbeknownst to him: During his last beating of her, Anthony promised over and over to kill Agnus if she ever spoke again.<BR>
	Russell just happened to know an old friend who claimed to be a psychic himself, and would perform simple parlor tricks to show people he was.  Russell didn't believe that he was a psychic, but sitting with his adopted daughter and watching her speak without speaking, he began to doubt these thoughts.  Russell called up Vincent and explained the situation.  Vincent wanted to see for himself, speaking in an excited voice, so Agnus was brought to him and Vincent asked her a series of questions.  At first, she'd open her mouth, but then she began tremble and her thoughts started projecting to everyone in the room.  It was then that everyone, including Agnus herself, found out that the young nine-year old was a full-blooded psychic.  Vincent performed a few more tests and confirmed she was.  Vincent himself was a Psychic as well, but this was one bit of knowledge that only he knew for sure--and to protect that knowledge, he acted like many of the fake psychics that had their own 1-900 numbers, thus persuading his friends that he was nuts.  So, he asked permission of Russell Oaks to bring Agnus under his wing in training.  At first the old restaurant owner refused, and said he'd have to think about it, then shuffled off with his daughter back to his own home.<BR>
	So, for six years, Agnus grew up and went to a school for the mute, since she was a voluntary mute and there was nothing that her parents could do to convince her to speak normally, and not frighten people with her telepathy, and they let her learn sign language to communicate and get a normal education.  Then six years from his first meeting Agnus, Vincent returned to Russell and Regina, and once again requested that the young psychic be taken under his arm.  This time, Russell accepted sadly, since he knew that if she didn't get her abilities trained, she would never be able to accomplish anything in life, with her thoughts would constantly broadcast to nearby people and her trait of never speaking.  Agnus was taken away once again, but this time to study and refine her abilities of her mind.<BR>
	Within a year, Agnus had managed to control her mental speaking to be able to direct it to one person, and with that stopped using her voice altogether (As if she did before then).  She was also taught, since she didn't speak at all, to move her lips in sync with her words, to give the illusion that she WAS speaking, but she wasn't actually using her voice.  Within two years, she was able to read the faces of other people and gauge their reactions to various events.  Two more years passed, and she was able to control and enhance the mental shield that was subconsciously erected years before in her pre-teenage years, and she was able to meditate to keep herself calm and under control of everything about her.  Vincent trained her mind hard, but that wasn't the only thing.  She was taught to use her sixth sense to aid her in physical defense.  She also worked her body hard, keeping it in almost an Olympic Triathlon shape.  Agnus was not only educated to live a normal life under her circumstances, but she was also taught to be adept at taking a person down, sometimes permanently.<BR>
	When Agnus was 20 years old, she left the care of the now old Vincent Vadel, and struck off on her own, with the words of Vincent in her mind: "You cannot learn anything more from me.  It is time to gain some field expertise."  He also added, "Try to find more like yourself, and harness the complete power of your abilities."  She continued her training by herself, learning new and interesting things almost every month.  She landed in a small town in Florida and became a deputy of the Sheriff's Department in the town, hoping to catch some psychics who wanted to stay away from a more public eye.  It was a simple, backwards town, who's cops were overweight slobs that were there for show, who wouldn't be able to remember the Miranda rights if they read it straight from a book.  Agnus, on the other hand, was the first and only woman on the force, and the only one who kept herself in shape.  The Department had been lacking in its authority, but as Deputy Oaks patrolled the streets, no lawbreaker was safe.  She quickly rose through the ranks, and became a senior deputy within a year.  However, she was also unique in another way--she never used a firearm.  All of the people she took down, she did with her bare hands or with her trusty stun baton.  Never once did she pick up a firearm to arrest anyone.  No one in the town knew why, except her:  Every time she looks at a gun, the moments that her biological parents died flash before her eyes.<BR>
	Agnus would have made Sheriff, but a dark night in the Sheriff's Department two years after she joined changed everything.  It was a day when two FBI agents entered the building and asked if there were any people in the town that spoke without using their mouths.  The deputies were all dumbfounded--no one here had that hocus pocus ability.  They thought the agents were insane, and explained that there was no such thing.  Agnus, however, was visibly pailing and was slowly moving towards the back exit.  She assumed that someone she had busted sometime ago had sent an anonymous tip to the FBI when she was caught not using her mouth.  She knew the warnings that Vincent Vadel told her: The FBI have been catching all the people with the "gift" and using them for experiments.  She was to stay away from them at all costs.  So, Agnus ran.  She fled far away from Florida to Louisiana, to the most desolate place she knew: Isle Voletta.  She had heard Vincent mumble things about it occasionally like how there were more than mortals in the town, but he'd never explain the island in full detail.  Considering these words, Agnus had come to the conclusion that this island was a haven for her kind.  Now, Agnus had just entered the island and used the rest of her money to put a down payment on her bachelor's pad, and landed a job as a security guard for the closest bank.  Here, Agnus Dei Oaks plans highly that the FBI won't track her here, and she can live a semi-decent life as a volunteer mute with the gift of the mental gab, and an incredible right hook.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>
