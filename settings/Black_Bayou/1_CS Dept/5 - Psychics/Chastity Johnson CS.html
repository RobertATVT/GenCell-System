<B>Description: </B>Do you know about the things that go bump in the night?  The myths and legends of all the different breeds are out there, ready to be found.  You must purchase lore separately for each breed you wish your character to know about.  The exact descriptions of each level of lore is in the description for each individual breed.  To learn additional levels of breed Lore, you must have an in-character source of information about that particular breed.  When you become a new breed, you automatically gain level 1 in that breed's lore.  Breed Lore acquired during character generation must be explained in the character's background.  If your character does not possess the Breed Lore, then they do not know anything about the existence of the breed.<BR>

<B>System:</B> 2d6+Income Skill Level vs TN listed below.<BR>
<B>Description:</B>  Our capitalistic society insists we accumulate green colored paper with which to purchase goods and services.  Each level of Income represents the amount of money ($15k per level) your character earns in a year.  This money is not an exact figure the character owns.  Rather, it is the symbolic representation of what your character can and cannot afford.  Any time your character wishes to purchase something costing $500 or more, an Income roll is required.  A failed attempt only means your character did not have the means to purchase the item or service at that moment.  The target number increases depending on the cost of the item or services as listed below.  If an income roll is failed, it may be attempted again the next day.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Gives the psychic the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The psychic may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The psychic may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  They are only a spectator.  The psychic may ask 3 questions in an instant message of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

When working, Chastity prefers Donna Karen and other top designer clothing that conveys the image of being professional.  Othertimes, you may find her in other fashionable dresses.  Always going for more sophisticated then soft and sweet.  Rarely in pants, prefering to keep up the apperence of being feminine.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Chastity was born into a military family in Alaska on March 21, 1970.  She was the younger of a pair of twins, Clara being the elder.  As a child and teenager, they managed to move a minimum of once a year.  Her favorite places being Houston and New Orleans.  <BR>
Once graduated from high school, Chastity headed on to college at Brown University.  Here she studied psychology along with being the star of the women's fencing team.  She also belonged to the down-hill skiing team, track and field and swimming team.  Once graduated, she wasn't satisfied with her bachelors.  She continued on to get her PhD in Clinical Psychology.  <BR>
Also in college, Chastity dabbled in the occult and soon found a teacher to show her the ways of the psychic.  Stella was a godsend to Chastity, teaching her not only all that she did;  Stella also taught her how to obtain a higher level of spirituality that forced Chastity out of her conservative Christian learnings.<BR>
<BR>
She has come to Isle Voletta to head the psychiatric ward at the General Hospital.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
