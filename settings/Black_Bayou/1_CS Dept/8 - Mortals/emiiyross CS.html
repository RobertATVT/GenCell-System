<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Emily was born in Chicago, Illinois, to a rather normal family. A father, a mother, and an older sister, Isabella. Emily was a shy child. And teenager. More than just shy, really...quite incapable of reaching out and opening up to anyone, except for on some occasions, when she was young, Isabella. This resulted in, many times, being ignored. At school, she felt like no one ever saw her. She wasn't taunted by the other children...she just felt like they didn't see her. Isabella was the awkward, made-fun of sibling. When Emily would go to school, she would go through the whole day without saying a single word, except for on the rare occasions when a teacher would ask her a question. Even by the teachers, she wasn't bothered, getting mostly B's on all her work. Enough to be considered a good student, not enough to get any special recognition. <BR>
<BR>
	When Emily would go home, Isabella was the one her parents paid attention to. Isabella was the straight-A student who was despised at school. Her parents would comfort Isabella, quiet her fears. Emily just hung to the shadows. <BR>
<BR>
	After high school, Emily didn't make it into the college of her top choice, Northwestern, while Isabella did. She suspected it was because she was never involved in any kind of extracurricular activities or community service, not because of her grades or intelligence. Still, she grew to resent Isabella, and her parents for always paying attention to her sister.<BR>
<BR>
	After college, Isabella got a well-paying job writing articles for a magazine. Emily, however, lived for the most part off her parents money, taking odd jobs at bookstores and coffee shops, while trying to break into a career as an artist. Out of boredom and a sense of adventure one day, she enrolled herself in an improv class. It helped shake her of some of her shyness, and she found out she had a natural talent for acting. Still, she couldn't seem to get close to anyone, and after a few months quit the class.<BR>
<BR>
	It was in the late summer of 1997 that Isabella decided to quit her job and temporarily move to the deep south, some strange small town not far from New Orleans, Louisiana called Isle Voletta. Isabella told Emily, before leaving, that she had stumbled upon it during a visit to New Orleans once, and thought the strange and eclectic nature of the place would inspire her to write a great Goth-horror novel. Not soon after Isabella moved, the Ross family received a phone call from a doctor in Isle Voletta that told them Isabella was dying from what they suspected to be an extreme case of food poisoning, the effects of which they could not counteract. The Ross family flew down, and not a day after their arrival, Isabella died. Before her heart stopped beating, she whispered to her family a plea to be buried in Isle Voletta. Her parents were upset, but respected her wish and had her buried in Voletta.<BR>
<BR>
	Emily was surprised to find she had mixed feelings about her sisters death. She was saddened and shocked, but something within her was leaping for joy, something that she couldn't repress. The feelings of glee overtook her, but made her depressed because she did not understand them. She started writing letters to her sister, like diary entries, whenever she felt like saying something. Some of them were deeply mocking. Some of them weren't. <BR>
<BR>
	She was working as a barmaid one night a year later at a Chicago nightclub when she met a man named Robert Cunningham. He was young, attractive, and on the brink of wealth. Emily hated him immediately, but made a promise to herself to have him. He came back to that nightclub three times a week, always came to leer at Emily and ask her out to dinner. She strung him along for a while before giving in. The relationship turned more serious as time went on. Emily still hated him, though, but she played along, a sadistic part of her that she had never before bowed down to wanting to crush him. <BR>
<BR>
	One night, he proposed to her. She opened her mouth to say no, but within that moment, a plan unfolded in her head. A plan devious and diabolical. Smiling widely, she accepted his proposal. It was soon after the engagement that Robert had to go on a two-week business trip. Emily took the opportunity to cheat on him with several men and further concoct her plan. After a trip to Isle Voletta to leave a deeply mocking, but well veiled letter to her sister, Emily stopped at a secluded, nondescript location outside of Chicago and purchased a special kind of poison from a strange man. She paid for it with cash Robert had hidden in his own house. The poison was fatal, and, according to the man, was undetectable in the bloodstream after death, requiring less than a full drop mixed in with food or drink to do the trick.<BR>
<BR>
	After Robert returned, and after less than a month of waiting, Emily and Robert wedded in a quiet ceremony at a local church and went on their honeymoon together. On the last night of the honeymoon, Emily slipped the poison into a glass of Robert's champagne, and he died. After covering up her crime thoroughly, she called the hospital. Using her natural acting talents and her own ability to deceive, she played the sorrowful damsel perfectly, easily convincing the detectives sent to question her that she was upset and not responsible for the death. An autopsy dismissed the cause of death as a heart attack, and Emily returned home to her parents, who comforted her.<BR>
<BR>
	After a few weeks of life post-murder in Chicago, Emily became restless. She didn't feel comfortable staying in Chicago. She wanted to go elsewhere. Some place where she could create a new identity for herself. Her mind, now twisted and warped with a strange evil, decided the perfect place would be the town where her sister died; Isle Voletta. Her short visits there revealed the town to be bursting with subculture and a strange nightlife, a place much more interesting than your average small town. Packing her suitcases, and taking the money Robert had left her, she bought a one-way plane ticket to Voletta, looking forward to the opportunity to dance on her sister's grave.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
