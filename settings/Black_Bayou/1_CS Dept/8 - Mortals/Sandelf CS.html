</B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

<B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  Jakob is 6'1" he is commonly dressed in baggy jeans which hang to his hips, a loose belt is tied to them. He commonly wears brown leather hiking boots. He usually wears a large tan jacket which hangs to his knees. His hair is a dark brown which is usually spiked up. There are two piercings in his ear, one at the top of the ear and one at the bottom. He is rather skinny, slightly muscular but not as to be muscle-bound. He has brown eyes a slight imperfection at the top of one of them. Due to his experience with "Jake-Hate" as he calls it, he carries spiked leather gloves in his pocket. In extreme measure he would have to use the pistol strapped to the inside of the back of his large coat. There is a scar on his right fore-arm from where he was a victim of "Jake-Hate". <BR>

  Jakob was born on 3/8/78 in Springfield Mass. Jakob is one of those rare kids with a wonderful voice. he also decided to pursue physical activities such as martial arts and sports as a child. he was highly likeable by most due to his charm. Unfortunately this was his downfall. He was quite the player in his teenage years which in turn manifested into many gaining a hatred to him due to the fact that he used them. Jakob then became quite the womanizing, love-a-holic. He left his home town upon the age of 20 after having a steady job as a singer in nightclubs. Many enjoyed his voice but unfortunately you can't live on that much income... so he traveled further.. until he found the most interesting place he had ever known.... Isle Voletta.<BR>
