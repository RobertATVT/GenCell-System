 System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  This spell enables the lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
 animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">ANTEmail 2</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 hour to cast<BR>
 Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a full hour to cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will for the lamia to start over a gain.  The lamia must role-play the hour long casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

 System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Born in Riverside California into the Cherokee tribe to a full blooded mother and father. The tribe shaman finding his spirit animal when he was born, per request of his parents, found that it was the raven, a very powerful and highly regarded totem, so his parents named him for his animal and no surname. Spirit animals change over time, but to have such a powerful totem at such  young age is a true gift and to keep it all your life is even more remarkable. He lead a normal life guided by his totem and his destiny, never really learning anything of his tribes belifes aside from spirit animal things. Later the Shaman realized that Raven would have great powers one day and told his parents and also told them that he would not find them here. So when he turned 18 he was given a motor cycle with his totem on it to travle the U.S. to find his power although he didn't know he would find power his parents just told him to travel and his totem would guide him. During his travels, when he was in New York he got the tattoo on his back. He arrived in Voletta only a few nights ago and somehow feels at home. He knows his journey is over, he just knows his quest is not complete.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
