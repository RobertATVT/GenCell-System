<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

Not unaesthetically pleasing, but somewhat exotic. He is naturally thin and lightly muscled and requires little effort to stay that way. When working at home, he is typically in white T-shirts stained a rainbow of colors and jeans similarly anointed. Mingling calls for long sleeved men's dress shirts all in dark, warm colors, jeans minus the stains, and his black leather jacket. Suits are an anathema.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>A month early, James Tallbear was born to a single Shoshone mother from the Wind River Reservation in the Landers hospital in central Wyoming. It had been a long, traumatic labor for his mother, without attendance from either family or the father. Her family had not been told of her pregnancy when she left. The father had not been Shoshone, but a French Canadian tourist with amber eyes like a wolf. She did not immediately return to the Wind River Reservation, but attempted to live in the capital city of Cheyenne for a year with her secret child. It was a hand-to-mouth sort of existence; she had been nineteen in 1972, with no skills to speak of. In 1973, though, she gave up and returned to her home on the reservation. But she could not take the child. When asked, after all, she had said she was baby-sitting someone else's child.<BR>
<BR>
James was given up for adoption and still young enough to be snatched up quickly, mixed heritage aside. Jackson and Krisha Wolfe doted on their new son. It had been his sterility and encroaching age that prompted the adoption, but Jackson was an enlightened sort. Together his new parents decided to change his name, feeling that it would make him feel more welcome as he grew older. Josiah's life, honestly, was little touched by hardship after his adoption. At least, until his birth mother contacted his adopted parents. She wanted her son to know about his people, or at least her people. The only things she remembered about his father after all this time was his eyes, amber and wolfish. He had inherited those eyes. He was sixteen when he met his mother, against his real wishes. He was humoring his parents, honestly. They agreed that he should know of his heritage.<BR>
<BR>
She called him James. It was not a pleasant day.<BR>
<BR>
He did not agree to see her again, though she did try. Communication was filtered through his parents, after that first meeting, however. He continued on with the interests that had developed through school. He had decided at the tender age of fourteen to be an artist. His birth mother, Michelle Tallbear, tried once more to meet with him in person before he left Wyoming for college in Houston's Art Institute. She hoped to persuade him to come to the reservation, after his studies, and depict modern tribal life. He was nineteen then and something cold had grown in him through her continued intervention in his life. Josiah told her in no uncertain terms that she had given him up, and had no right to his attention or affection after that.<BR>
<BR>
That last meeting stayed a source of disagreement with his parents while he was away, but they did not press. They saw the hurt it caused their son. He maintained little to no working knowledge of his mother's people. He preferred the culture he had been raised with. He returned to Wyoming to make his name, and take care of his now-ailing parents. He did become a well known nature and abstract artist. Late in the December of 1998, began the end of his time in Wyoming. His mother died in her sleep; simple and painless. Josiah watched grief kill his father over the next year, though medical reports listed heart failure.<BR>
<BR>
Michelle appeared in that wreckage to offer him comfort, another family. He shut the door in her face and began making plans to move. Isle Voletta was selected with the dart board method, and a house was bought. Then, without word to anyone, he made a path south.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
