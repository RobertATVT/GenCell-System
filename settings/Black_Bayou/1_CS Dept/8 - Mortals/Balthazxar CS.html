</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>Generation Cost:</B> 5 / <B>Experience Cost:</B> 25  <BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><I>Shepherd's Aura</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </I>-1 Soul each use.  (##ShepAura <victim>##)<BR>
Generation Cost: </B>5<B> / Experience Cost: </B>25<B><BR>
System/Duration:</B>  2d6+Will vs. 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate. <BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Some mortals seem to be blessed with a natural affinity toward animals.  With the use of this mastery, a mortal can calm an animal and befriend him for a time, be it wild or tame.  Simple, one word verbal commands given to the animal will be understood.  The duration can be extended with the expenditure of extra soul, no re-roll is necessary.  Shepherd's Aura has the potential to affect a breed while it is in an animal form, including Horus.  In any case, if the roll is against a player character, then the roll is vs the targets 2d6+Will.  These feelings tend to carry over to the mortal form and are viewed as "good vibes."</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

His shoulder legnth black hair falls in straight dead locks around his face.  His skin, extremly pale from lack of sun, gains an almost ghostly appearance set against such drastically dark colors.  He's usually seen in black clothing for no purpose other then he enjoys flaunting his milkish skin.<BR>

	The young man's name, Blathazxar.  Balthazxar Quintana.  At age 0 when he was born and currently age 23 he wouldn't be considered very old by any standards other then a five year olds.  An attractive man, though extremly pale.  His hair flows down to his shoulders in straight jet black locks, beautiful black eyes piercing in nature.  Born and raised in south Florida in a predominantly Cuban family he holds much to his heritage and finds any other race of people of "lower standards and class".<BR>
	His mother was a high priestess in the art of Wicca and had a child simply for the purpose of raising him to take her place.  Balthazxar never went to school, he knows very little about getting along with people outisde his family.  His entire life was made of sitting with his mother and learning the art of balck/white magic, communing with the spirits and that razzle.  Consequently he got little to no sun, and looks much paler then any live man should.<BR>
	Now finally, his mothers death... he steps up to the plate.  As knowledgable as he can be for one with little experience he has his eyes set on a little town his mother and he visited when he was young.  A town by the name of Voletta.  He figures he'll start his take over small, a small town with enough problems as it is.  Surely he could find a few people to enter his coven there... if he could only figure out how to talk to them...<BR>
