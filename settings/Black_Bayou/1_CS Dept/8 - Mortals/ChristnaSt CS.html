<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>An overzealous curl sprang back from the restraint of the shell-shaped ear it had just been tucked behind as Chris noted the rubenesque form taking up residence beside her desk. Frigid blue eyes, that reveal a warm violet hue on closer inspection, shift across liquid chocolate pools teaming with unshed tears and french manicure boasting hands wringing relentlessly at one another. <BR>
<BR>
"Jeanne, you know I have to do this, hon."<BR>
<BR>
"I know." Even when strained due to a fight for control, Jeanne still had a voice Chris would give anything for; a deep melodious voice that sometimes seemed more a sigh formed into words. "The kids won't understand, though. No one is as good with them as you are." <BR>
<BR>
"Not true, you work just as hard with them as I do. You should stop underestimating your work." In a characteristic attempt at calming the woman beside her down, Chris rose to her feet and closed her arms about the shorter woman, sympathetic tears springing unbidden into her own eyes. Jeanne had been a major part of the last 7 years of her life and she was no more prepared to leave the woman behind than her friend was to accept it. Her first day on the ranch had brought her into contact with the feisty, outspoken woman who could be brutally honest and put you at ease in the same moment. The glossy sheen of her newly acquired psychology diploma was no protection against Jeanne's praise and criticism, both given in the same comforting tones.  <BR>
<BR>
"It won't be the same."<BR>
<BR>
The Ranch, a place where badly behaved and unwanted boys were sent as a last resort, <BR>
boasted a wide range of counselors whose skills papered the walls in the form of diplomas and pictures from the boys who had managed to graduate college or find their nitche in other ways. Jeanne had ridden her during the first 3 months of her term and had spent the remaining years using her as an example for newer employees. <BR>
<BR>
For years, as a child in Montana, she had concentrated solely on her skills as a barrel racer. Robert and Christina Stanford watched as she progressed from her first pony, to a gelding, to a spirited, headstrong chestnut mare. Horses were like an extension of herself and riding them came almost as second nature. By 12 she had won more competitions than her mother and had charmed the judges into allowing her to race in a higher age bracket. A choice they did not regret. <BR>
<BR>
In November of her 18th year a half-buried log ruined her dreams. The impact of a 14 hand horse falling upon her leg should have crippled her for life. However, the cushion of 3 feet of snow made certain that, while she would not be winning any further competitions, she would walk. <BR>
<BR>
Psychology became her comfort. School managed to blunt her restlessness and feed her mind as she learned again how to ride and manage the horses she so loved. Frequently angry over her loss. Upon graduation, Christine was employed at, what was fondly called The Ranch, and spent the next seven years of her life there. Due to the frequency of her work bringing her into contact with boys considered deliquents, she became involved in many legal aspects as well. Soon she found herself rallying beside them in court and dealing one on one with their probation, and in rare cases, their parole officers. This lead to an interest in legal psychology and drove her to move to Isle Voletta Louisiana where she intends to apply for the position of staff psychologist at the local police department.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
