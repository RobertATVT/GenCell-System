They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 Background:<BR>
 </B><BR>
	Born to an American family in the carribean he grew up in a villa with semi wealth.  His father was a mayor of a small town that overlooked the beatiful Gulf of Mexico.  Though his father seemed to be a lawful man to the public he had a darker side, that of a drug smuggler.  Because of this  Ha Keel grew up learning how to take care of "business" so to speak.  From an early age he showed signs of being a marksman and was able to pick targets off at a large distance.  <BR>
	Upon reaching the age of 20 he left his fathers house to inspect holdings in Florida.  While riding in a small plane the DEA made a raid and brought the plane down for inspection.  Upon finding out he was the son of a wanted drug lord they took him into custody and to a prison in southern Alabama.  There he spent eight years in a federal prison.  One night two men came to his cell and opened it, telling him to come with them.  Doing so he soon found out that the men were his fathers doing and that he was now a free man.  Heading swiftly for an air field he boarded another plane and was soon on his way back to his fathers home.<BR>
	While flying over Lousiana the plane was again found by the DEA and when they refused to land the plane it was shot down.  He barely escaped with his life and took refuge in the swamp, determined to get to Texas then back home.  That is where he stumbled onto Voletta.  Having had money given to him after being busted from the prison he swiftly armed himself with his two favorite weapons and decided to ply his trade in this city for awhile as it had cought his interest.  Being a sharp person with keen eyes he noticed much odd behavior from certain people and places within the city.  His courosity perked he now works as an assassin for hire within the city.  Because of his high profile he must still dodge the law, or eliminate it if possible.   His first day there he was attacked by a strange wolf beast which he soon figured to be a werewolf.  Because of this he now hunts them with more ferocity then any other group, though he never loses site that the real money is still making hits on humans.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
