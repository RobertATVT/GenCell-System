<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> The young woman before you stands quite small.  A maximum of 5'2, and barely breeched, at that.  Loosely coiled tendrils of autumnal silk spill arrent over cotton-draped shoulders, locks of a darkest wine streaked by the occasional thread of sunfire woven into their strands.  The musician's eyes collect the hues of a lush rainforest, deep and a darkening green save for the pupils' edges where a dust of dirty smoke has stained them gray.  Despite the wide, observative nature of her gaze, and the smile often curving full, rosie lips.. the woman seems to remain in a state of detached understanding.  Watch, please..and understand.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></I>       Emma Thayne was born on a January evening 21 years ago.  She was born deaf.  Her parents, Magdelena and Gregory Thayne didn't learn of her affliction until she was two years old.  They considered themselves blessed with a child who never cried.. yet, oddly enough, never cooed or laughed.  When the doctor proclaimed her deaf, it sent them into shock.  They tried every way possibly to prove that she could hear their voices, the sounds they made.. but nothing worked.  Instead of having to live with a child so detached from all they knew, they sent her to a live-in school for the deaf/mute.  She grew up in a place not her home, she skipped down halls painted a stale gray instead of the violet she dreamed of, and she went on smiling despite the silence inherent to her gaze.  She learned to draw pictures in the air as a means of communication, sign language, as they called it.  She learned like any other student, through reading and writing and understanding.  She learned to read lips quickly, and when she got older, received a hearing aide.  The hearing aide enabled her to learn the simplest vowels an consonants, providing her with a semblence of broken speech.  But she hated this tool, she hated the look in people's eyes as they attempted to understand her words.  And found that drawing her air pictures was much easier.  She became an interpreter for deaf children when she turned 18, and she'd only seen her parents a total of ten times her entire life.  She assumed that all families were this way.  Afterall, the stories were all the same in the school where she lived.  <BR>
        After her 18th birthday, she moved out of the school and found an apartment.  She had learned to play the piano at The School, but it had never occured to her that she could play anywhere else.  The apartment she'd rented came furnished, complete with an old, worn piano who's chords were slightly out of tune.  But it was a piano.  Her fingers descended upon the ivory of its keys, following the vibrations delt by the strumming chords as the checkerboard of its notes fell beneath her imagination.  She could not hear the beauty of its song, but she could feel it; she could imagine it, and make it a reality.<BR>
       She moved through life in this way.  She maintained work at the school as an interpreter, and played concerts in the evenings for a crowd who left shivering from the lingering sounds of her music.  An each time they approached to relay a compliment, the pianist's hands would lift, crooking and twisting in a dance of humble acceptance. "Don't thank me, just enjoy my gift", she would sign.  And someone who had been to more than one concert would arrive by her side, and translate as best they could to the newcomer.  That is how she taught the ignorant.  Through generosity, and patience.  She knew that every sign made sense when people bothered to watch.  So, please, watch.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

       A small school for disabled children recently opened in a small town off the coast of Louisiana.  They need helpers badly, and the now 21 Emma has decided to stop in and offer her services to those who need it.<BR>
