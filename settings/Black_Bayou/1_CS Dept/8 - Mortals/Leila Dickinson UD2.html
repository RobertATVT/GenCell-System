These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

<B>Advantage:</B>  Although often eccentric and seem to do things apparently strange to us as they create, authors have that special gift that turns creativity into works of art.  Therefore, authors gain +3 to any Writing rolls they attempt.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	Born in Columbus Ohio, Leila  has always been interested in two things, the supernatural and writing.  It is only given that the two things she is most fascinated with might become meshed together to create a form of employment. While not quite Maya Angelou in stature yet, Leila is known as an up and coming writer in the science fiction world. Yet, even her science fiction does not surpass the poetry that haunts her soul to almost obsessive levels. Yet it was not always this way. <BR>
<BR>
	Leila was like any little girl of the time, she made plenty of friends with the girls and had even more boy admireres with her chocolate locks painted with hints of strawberry and eyes the color of thunderclouds. As she grew, she tended to dress a little more urban-hippish then her friends, and yet could pass through any of the social crowds because of her fresh looks and friendly personality. In fact her mother lovingly said that -her- daughter could talk the devil out of his pitchfork. It was at the age of fourteen Leila's attitude took a drastic turn.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Find me dear breeze<BR>
And carress my burning flesh<BR>
That the tortured screams of agony<BR>
	 Might end with your gentleness<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	Puppy love should be many things, but harnful isn't one of them. Unfortunately for Leila, hers was the most harmful, for she fell for a Vampire stuck in the body of a 17 year old. Bitter at the world, he had made his career in destroying all that was beautiful in life, and could not resist trying to do so with Leila. Through seduction and enchantment, he lulled her into his web before taking away bit by bit everything she held dear. Finally, she was left with only the memories of a family she had loved, now dead, and a lover who had created her into his image, mortal, yet not. She was a slave to his desires as he tried to drain her of all the goodness she had. <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>But still my gentle lover,<BR>
Bring your arms around me.<BR>
Hold me tight in your embrace<BR>
So, though my soul might be fleeting<BR>
When death does come.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	Yet Leila was a soul who could find the goodness in any situation, and found it most deftly in a hidden talent brought to the surface. To escape the harsh reality of her situation, a situation she didn't truely understand, she began to write. One journal entry become another, and then another, and when her lover died by the hands of his own chyldren and she found herself free and alone, she turned those journals into a best-selling piece of Fiction named <I>My Story.</I> By the age of 17 she was a best seller. Yearning for knowledge of the reason her parents were dead though, still not quite able to grasp why this creature killed her family, she began researching Vampires, finding a sickening fatuation with learning about the terrors that hurt her for so long. <BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Find me dear breeze,<BR>
Carress my dying flesh. <BR>
That tortured screams of Agony <BR>
	Might end in gentleness<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	Leads and interviews finally brought the twenty year old Leila Dickenson to Isle Voletta, where a rash of deaths and unsolved murders held firm believement with her insiders that perhaps what she was looking for could be found in that far off distance of a land.  And so, with her Editor's Approval and the Publishing Company's heady conmtribution she moved to Voletta to find out the Reality behind the Myth of the Vampires of Isle Voletta. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
