This is the last approved sheet I could find. <g>  It was actually reactivated in Dec '99, but you need to get it in every two months to keep it from going inactive again.  I had to adjust your Willpower modifier, a miscalculation had it two points higher than what it should have been.  And I updated your CS with the newest release of the military occupation, you don't get any extra skills however there are more skills that you can buy at a lower cost. Everything else looks good.  Game on!<B><BR>

Congratulations! Save this approved sheet for your records.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>* </B>It has become apparent through my experience in BB, that oftentimes vehicles are utilized in RP. So, in response to that, I have decided to include this little aside for use by the ST should more need to be known about my truck. <BR>
   <BR>
      ~ It is a Pull truck, like the kind you see in county fairs. It is designed for power, not speed.<BR>
      ~The Dodge weighs 8,625 lbs. This is due to the massive frame and suspension work Kyle has personally done to it. <BR>
      ~The truck will go from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, and has a max speed of 75-80 mph. <BR>
      ~ It has a snow plow bracket, and a Mopar factory sno-blade which will be attached in the event that it snows in Louisiana.<BR>
      ~ The Dodge gets 6.3 miles to a gallon.<BR>
      ~ The truck has two batteries in it, one is not attached to the alternator, and is not in normal use on the road.<BR>
      ~ The truck has a nitrous tank on it that will allow VERY short bursts of speed. The truck will not however be able to exceed 90 mph. (Speed burst will last about 20 seconds)<BR>
      ~ In the event that I do go really fast in the truck, say more than 90 mph, there is a high degree of possibility that I will throw a rod or turn a cam bearing, thus stopping the vehicle and making a loud horrible $2,000 noise.<BR>
      ~ The truck, like all Powerwagons is all-time, all-wheel drive.<BR>
      ~The truck is worth about $41,000...not that I'd ever get that for it, but that's about what it would book for.<BR>
      ~ I have 640 Horse power (That is a good bit, but not excessive)<BR>
      ~ I have 980 ft./lbs. of torque (That is excessive, but true. Remember, this is a pull truck. <BR>
      ~ Nitrous can take it up to about 720 HP and 1020 ft./lbs. of torque.<BR>
      ~ 1020 ft./lbs. of torque means. A) I do not get stuck if I have any wheels on the ground. B) I can easily push/pull any other vehicle (Barring any other pull trucks in Voletta) C) Mud, water, other cars, and swampy ground are pretty much the same as driving on the street.<B></I>  <BR>

    Background:    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><I>I was born in Berkeley County West Virginia. I led a pretty normal life, a lot of friends, a lot of fun. Everything was great until I turned 18, and my parents told me that it was time for me to get out on my own. I tried a few different jobs, but none of them really paid the bills. I was left with very few options. I decided that I should join the Army. After all, most of my expenses would be paid, and I could get out of my hometown.<BR>
       I enlisted as soon as I got the chance, and despite my inherent rebellious nature, I did pretty well in my training. I advanced a little in the ranks, and was looking to possibly make the Army my life instead of just a way out of West Virginia. However, two weeks after I transferred out, and moved to my new station in Nova Scotia, I got an emergency telephone call from home. I was being notified that my fiance was dead. <BR>
       I applied and was granted a stay of service while I returned for the funeral. Upon my homecoming, I was more properly informed on the details of her death. It had been ruled a suicide, but I thought differently. After reading the police reports, and doing a little of my own research, I found something that didn't add up. While I was going through her phone records, I found a call placed from her home several hours after she had reportedly killed herself. Upon dealing with the phone company, I found that the call was made to a one Darren Masterson, of New York, New York. <BR>
       I went to New York. I went after this Darren Masterson. I spent most of my money for information, trying to locate him. I was now AWOL from the Army, and nobody knew where I was. Finally, I did track down Darren Masterson. My last bit of money loosened his toung just enough to learn that Ariel (my fiance) was murdered, and that the man responsible had fled to a town know as Isle Voletta, LA.<BR>
       I followed them...<BR>
       <BR>
       After a short stay in Voletta, and meting with some of the locals, I began to piece together what was happening. It seemed as though my previous outlook on life and death was ill-conceived. I learned that there are things beyond my understanding. After meeting with Jade Fortea, and her husband Daren, I opened my mind to other possibilities. My brother James came to Voletta to deliver a message to me. It was hard news to take, but I believe him. My fiance, Ariel's body had come up missing...<BR>
