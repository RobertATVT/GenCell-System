 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Luck</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6 + Mind vs TN: 16 / Scene; takes 1 turn to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The ghoul is a confident creature in most situations, almost to the point of arrogance.  This confidence, when firmly believed in can strengthen the Will of the ghoul, granting it a bonus of +3 Will.  This confidence is removed the moment the ghoul fails to avoid an attack or mastery for the rest of the night, or fails any other dice roll, as its confidence is now shaken.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Ghoul and their Vampire master have created a blood bond.  With this bond, the Ghoul has a very limited form of Mindspeak.  They may only communicate with their master, and only when within sight.  The Ghoul may only transmit mental thoughts, and only to their master, and only while under the effects of ghouling.  <BR>

 <B>Effect/Description: </B> A ghoul will recover from damage taken in battle in a most unique way.  When taken to 0 Body, a ghoul can summon one last burst of energy.  After they spend the point of soul, the player makes the roll listed above.  For every point above the target number they score, their character regains 1 point of Body.

Breed: </B>Ghoul-- supposing this UD goes through before his week runs out. <B><BR>
Age and/or birth date: </B>March 8, 1944<B><BR>
Eye Color: </B>Black<B><BR>
Hair: </B>Deep red<B><BR>
Height/weight: </B>6' 1"/ 145 lb<B><BR>
Occupation: </B>Scholar<B><BR>
Equipment/weapons: </B> Giacomo carries with him his trusty 44 magnum, but never needs it.  His body is far more lethal than any weapon he could carry.  But...he does not want to toss his immortality away because of some squabble and carries with him a sizable amount of cash in order to "smooth" things over.  Also necessary for a man of his "connections" is the ever important cell phone, because, you never really know when those "coffee" shipments are going to arrive from Columbia.<B><BR>
Appearance(clothes, etc..):<BR>
  </B>Giacomo is clothed only in the finest of clothes;  Italian loafers, Armani suits, Corinthian leather.  But underneath this layer of dazzle and flash, their beats the heart of a fiend.  He exudes evil and all he touches is either corrupted or turned to gold.  However, all this malice is covered by a thin veneer of placidity and apathy; peirced only by the soulless stare of his obsidian eyes.<B><BR>
  </B><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<B>Background:<BR>
	</B>Giacomo was born to a poor Italian family.  His father was a baker, but unfortunately not a very good one and thus the family was pitched into continual struggle.  Giacomo, being the middle child of 10 was starved for attention, but was met only by the harsh teachings of his Roman Catholic mother when he tried to excell.  Because of his starvation at times and lack of family, Giacomo soon drew within himself.<BR>
        By his teens years, Giacomo was an extraordinarily rebellious individual.  This rebellion, however, was not only confined to his parent's control over him, but also towards God, Himself.  As a result, Giacomo readily immersed himself in all forms of vice.  He became an avid drug user and drunk and at the age of 18, his parents tossed him to the streets.  They had 9 other children to fill the gap, and they were determined not to be undermined by an upstart teenager.  So, Giacomo gladly left and resumed his life on the street.<BR>
        In order to fund this life, Giacomo sold the only thing he had left, his body.  He became a prostitue and quite well known.  He entertained street urchins and dignitaries alike.  All in exchange for money to buy his true love, cocaine.  These years as a shiftless, rootless, person hardened Giacomo and transformed what little innocence he possessed into a cold calculating demeaner.<BR>
         It was this demeaner which attracted the attention of a very pale man as he strode  down the avenue which Giacomo was "working".  The man was intrigued by the hardset chin and the cold look in Giacomo eyes.  He fell in love at first sight, but watched from afar, not knowing Giacomo's occupation.<BR>
         Instead, this man revealed his presence in short bursts to Giacomo and tried to seduce the youth.  However, the caterization of Giacomo's soul had left him impervious to the man's advances.  This defeat drove the man's passions to even furter extremes and finally over the edge.  As a result, the man cornered Giacomo one night and revealed his true vampiric nature to struggling youth.<BR>
         This nature enthralled Giacomo and he begged the man to share it with him.  However, this time it was the man's turn to be elusive and he denied Giacomo this gift, but left him with his name, that of Gabriel.  The idea of immortality consumed Giacomo and he fell into a vast yearning everytime Gabriel was near.  Giacomo offered his blood and Gabriel took it, but never enough to cause the transformation.  For several months, Giacomo lay trapped between the desperation of Gabriel denying him immortality, and the ecstacy of being fed upon.  These extremes further hardened Giacomo, until he was completely devoid of emotion, save the ambition to live forever.<BR>
        Eventually, Gabriel acquiesced and took completed the ritual of turning Giacomo into a creature of the night, and that is how Giacomo was received into darkness; an arduous struggle with a disappointingly undramatic climax.<BR>
        However, Giacomo's story does not end there.  That is only the beginning.  The rest of Giacomo's tale takes place in the 1970's in the city of Rome after Gabriel and Giacomo have built a family and a shipping empire.  On the tenth anniversary of his reception into darkness, Giacomo perpetrates the ulitmate betrayal by destroying his sire.<BR>
        With Gabriel dead, Giacomo returns to his family in order to ascend to the position of family head.  However, his brothers and sisters do not respect or trust him nearly enough and subsequently to do instate him as either the Family Head, or the CEO of Fairfax Shipping.<BR>
        Giacomo, who had anticipated such a move by his family, again delved into his heart of darkness and pulled out another horrifying betrayal.  He paid several expert hunters who lived in Rome and gave them the whereabouts of where his family resided during the day.  As a result, these hunters completely wiped out the Fairfax family in a single day, leaving Giacomo the only one with claim to the shipping empire.<BR>
        But, without his family to dominate or their adoration, Giacomo grew tired of Rome.  He tired of the history and the Church and even the business.  So...he severed all ties with anyone in Italy, had his mortal family murdered to the last one, and sold his corporation.<BR>
       With the millions he made off of the sale, Giacomo simply wandered the world.  During the eighties, he wandered the major cities of Asia and America, and in about 1994 in New York he tried to establish a family, but his attempt only met with tragedy as his chyldren were destroyed very quickly. So, he left the Big Apple and looked for a suitable place to build an empire and a family.<BR>
  <BR>
      And in January of 1998, he found Voletta....<BR>
      He lived in Voletta from 1/98 until 5/99.  He sired a number of childer, but only three were alive by the time he left and he had discovered a long lost vampiric relative.  In 6/99 he was contacted by his aunt to hunt down an errant childe.  He killed this childe in New Orleans and started to dabble in infernalism until his childhood friend cast out the vampirism within him.  In Janurary 2000 he returned to Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I><U><BR>
