They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<BR>
 Background:Michael Van Helsing was born in the suburbs of London to Richard and Catherine Van Helsing, the Van Helsings are an old family often enwrapped in mysterious doings, they have had several famous Vampire hunters in there midst(Yes -those- Vn Helsings) but generally they are a quiet family and the supernatural aspects are rarely spoken of.<BR>
<BR>
Michaels father was one of the said Vampire hunters, killing a few vampires before retiring to his stately London home to brag to his friends in the country clubs.<BR>
<BR>
Michael grew up listening to his fathers tales of adventure against the evil Vampire hordes, when he was eight, Micheal moved to the United states with an Uncle who worked for a Psychic detection firm. <BR>
<BR>
Michael grey to enjoy moving about the world loaoking for supernatual stuff to gawk at, but finally quit the agency at 18 to go to his true calling..Vampire Hunter!<BR>
<BR>
Or so he thoughts anyway, in fact he was a lousy Vampire hunter, he never killed anything and couldn't figure out how to kill Vampires since his father had conveiniently forgotten to enlighten him on this fact.<BR>
<BR>
The real reason he was a crummy Vampire hunter was that he had a bad tendency to get his butt kicked by any form of serious opposition. He is a crummy fighter though he tries hard, he doesn't like fighting.<BR>
<BR>
He is actually a lover instead of a fighter(a term which has surely been used too much) he enjoys chatting his problems out instead of bonking heads.<BR>
