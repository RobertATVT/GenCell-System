<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Elisabeth Kylie Langfield was born in Texas on her parents ranch. Her mother (Eve) and father (Adam) were one of those rare couples who actually loved one another when they married and got along quite well. Elisabeth was an only child and her parents devoted most of their time to her. Needless to say, she developed a sort of "I'm better than everyone else" attitude and was selfish about many things. This carried on into adulthood. Her years on the ranch taught her how to care for the livestock, ride and tame horses as well as other animals, the easy points of bargaining, and to get what you pay for. Her experiences on her family's ranch also left her knowing more about how to take care of herself and less about how the world works. Elisabeth doesn't always look at things through various angles and basically only sees things her way and believes everyone else should too. However, her vision, charisma, magnetism, beauty, and charm are hard to resist and throughout high school she had many boyfriends. Those relationships meant nothing to her and had it not been for her parents caring and devoted relationship, Elisabeth probably wouldn't have believed that true love actually existed. And because she never settled for second best, few guys were good enough for her. She often times avoided romantic attractions. Elisabeth only attended the thirteen mandatory years of school. Her grades were only average. After graduating, Elisabeth stayed on her parents ranch. That's when Brielle came to stay with them. Brielle was 17. She was an only child and her mother had raised her her entire life. Brielle's mother had been best friends with Elisabeth's mother Eve for as long as Elisabeth could remember. But until then, Brielle and Elisabeth had never met. So when Brielle's mother passed away, Eve was happy to take custody of Brielle. Elisabeth and Brielle developed a close friendship almost as soon as she arrived. They trusted each other with everything and never before had Elisabeth felt so close to anyone. Although Brielle's feelings ran deeper than Elisabeth's. Brielle saw Elisabeth in a romantic sense to be her true soul mate. Elisabeth was not at all attracted to Brielle, but enjoyed the time they spent together. Brielle taught Elisabeth so much about sensitivity. Through it all Elisabeth never intended to leave the ranch. She had too much going for her there. But when Elisabeth turned 20, the ranch started making less and less money and her parents thought they'd have to sell it. Elisabeth didn't want to stick around to see that, so she packed her few belongings and hit the road leaving Brielle heartbroken. Brielle vowed never to forgive Elisabeth for running away from the problem and leaving her behind. She lived out of her suitcase for about a year. Many times she'd make stops with strange guys who'd promise her room and board for a while. In return she would have to do what she was told. Elisabeth tried to be good, to give them what they wanted but money was the only matter on her mind and she daydreamt most of the time. She dreamt of horses.  She finally made a stop in a little island Lousiana town where she decided to stay.<BR>
