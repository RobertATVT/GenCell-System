System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Generation Cost: </B>20<B> / Experience Cost </B>100<B><BR>
System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  To some, nature bestows special gifts.  These people have the unique ability of using both hands equally well.  The character may take 2 attacks per round, one with each hand.  These attacks are limited to small bladed, small arms, non-lethal attacks and hand-to-hand fighting, as the rest of the skills tend to require the use of two hands.  The attack made with the regular hand is rolled normally and the attack made with the second hand is made with -4 to attack.  The defender is allowed to dodge normally, taking a -2 penalty for each attack after the first for the round.  i.e. If DavisMason is dodging this mortal as his first dodge for the round, he dodges the first attack normally.  The dodge for the second attack is at -2.  Each dodge after that suffers a -2 penalty as normal.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human soul is known to manifest itself during desperate times of need.  During times of intense fear or when faith is the only thing they have left, mortals tend to reach deep down into places they didn't even know existed and harnessing this energy from everything that makes them mortal.  As a result, the player may add +8 to the next Faith roll their character makes (only applies when a the Faith skill is used).  This mastery may only be used once per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B></I>Thexter MyCaron was raised in the forests of northern Wisconsin.  He learned to hunt and fish at a very young age.  He learned all sorts of woodlore during this time...trapping, foraging, living on the land.  Thexter's father was a Forest Ranger and his mother was a professional domestic engineer.  She sometimes did some waitressing down at the local greasy spoon, but for the most part, she took care of the four children.  Thexter was the oldest of the four, and the only boy.  His three younger sisters; Sarah, Betsey and Hope, were mostly a pain in his collective backside.  Thexter's childhood was fairly easygoing, he knew how to fight a little from messing around, but had a laidback and friendly attitude so stayed out of trouble.   He was always big for his age.  By the time he was a freshman in high school, he was 6'3" and 225 pounds.  The forest life was good to him, turning his body lean and muscular on a large frame.  His light blonde hair contrasted slightly with his dark brown eyes....eyes that were so brown, in some light they looked black.  Despite his parents wishes, he didn't want to put in papers and forms to go to college; he wanted to join the military.  Anything to get out of nowhere-ville.  So he did.  Right after high school, Thexter joined the army.  By now he had sprouted a couple of inches and gained a few more pounds, so at 6'5" , 235 pounds he was the biggest guy in his basic training platoon.  He received alot of "extra-special" treatment from the Drill Sergeants, but it only toughened his resolve to make it through this hell and get on with something else.  A few long weeks later and he was on his way.  11B was his job, Infantry.  Soon after Basic Training he received schooling in Airborne and Air Assault.  He went to sniper training and got Pathfinder training to go along with everything else.  Thexter was feeling good, real good.  In top physical condition from all of the rucksack marching and constantly chosen from the masses for praise or challenging tasks because of his ability to easily accomplish difficult missions.  Thexter learned alot about people in the military too.  One of his favorite saying is "you meet all kinds" and it was true.  He learned street smarts and even how to dance; two things he had no knowledge of way up there in Nowhere-ville, Wisconsin.  During his second year in the military, horror struck.  He received a phone call from his aunt informing him that his whole family had died in a house fire.  It had happened at night when they were sleeping and none of them got out alive.  Thexter was crushed.  His whole world was turned upside down.  He went home to the funeral and couldn't understand why this had happend to him.  What had he done to receive this punishment from God?  He was going to stay home for a few weeks to sort out his thoughts.  The day after the funeral, however, he received a phone call from his unit.  Get your butt on a plane now, something is going down in Saudi Arabia and you need to get back.  Thexter, instead of being angry at this, was kind of relieved.  It was an excuse to push this hell aside and focus on something else.  And that's just what he did.  His performance during operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm was exemplatory.  He received many awards for bravery and valor in combat.  His commanding officers used words like "outstanding" and "dedicated"  Thexter knew the truth.  Having nothing left to live for, he put everything he had into this war and literaly became a killing machine.  It was also during this war that he met Jundler Hassed, a young man from Riyahd, Saudi Arabia.  Jundler was a real breathing Arabian Prince that had befriended Thexter after a incredible incident in northern Riyahd.  It dealt with a night terrorist attack and how Thexter had singlehandedly.... anyway, Thexter had won the attentions of Jundler.  Soon after the incident, Jundler contacted Thexter and showed kindness and intelligence.  After a few tenuous days, when Thexter wasn't in the field, he was with Jundler.  Most of the other guys in the unit didn't mind at all, as long as that "psycho" Thexter wasn't around, they could rest.  He was a great guy to have in combat, but not in garrison.  He would do things like count bullets or sharpen his knife or...well, it was just damn disturbing.  What Thexter  did not realize, and what would change his life forever, was that Jundler was a vampire, a blood sucking visitor of the night.  Jundler decided his best reward for Thexter would be to increase Thexter's already incredible talents.  Jundler promised never to give the curse to anyone....that he, Jundler,  would be the last, but Thexter needed something to live for, so Jundler could train him in other things that he knew.  The very next day Jundler told Thexter of his horrible, yet wonderful curse.  At first Thexter didn't believe him, but Jundler showed Thexter a few common tricks of the vampires trade.  Thexter came to an understanding, but was very frightened...no, wrong word...better would be facinated.  Soon after this revolutiion, Jundler settled him down and they talked....for a long time.  As they talked, Thexter was horrified by the idea of his friend being a vampire, but then an incredible urge to learn from this amazing man struck him.  Thexter found himself staying at Prince Jundler's more and more, but knew that something had to be done soon, because if he kept up this tardiness, his unit would start to look for him.   Thexter immediately decided that the military had nothing else to teach him.  The experiences had been very rewarding, but here....here was something that couldn't be turned down.  Jundler understood his friends passion, and came up with a plan where Thexter would die during a staged night fight; just his dog tags and a boot would be left.  Thexter thought it should work.  After a few days, in the wee hours of the night, Thexter was called back to duty.  He knew he would, and knew just where and what to do.  The plan went without a hitch and according to the U.S. Army, Thexter MyCaron was officially killed in action on February 17th, 1991.  Thexter stayed for six more years in Saudi Arabia, learning everything he could from Jundler.  Jundler knew Aribic, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian and the German languages.  Soon, Thexter knew each as well as the instructor.  Even though Thexter was not a vampire, he was a mortal in top condition.  Jundler used this to teach Thexter on movement; the ways to move and not be seen, to be silent and move with speed and purpose.  Also, using his size as intimidation; his eyes and voice to slightly hypnotize people, using his voice to carry a whisper across a crouded room.   ...proper ways to get into and out of buildings, rooms, alleys and other places without being seen, or with the entire place noticing him.  Several forms of martial arts were also taught.  Thexter learned to do things with his mind and body that very few had ever known.  Jundler even taught Thexter to slow his heart rate down and turn all thoughts inward to speed healing and survive without food and water for long periods of time......all these Thexter learned.  After  six years were up, Jundler just didn't have anything else to teach Thexter.  Since his drive was still there, Thexter wanted to know more.....to do more.  Jundler had heard of Isle Volett, a community of "more than normal" people in Louisiana.  Jundler told Thexter of this place and Thexter was more than happy to get on a plane and get there as soon as he could.  The two seperated sorrowfully.  Jundler had filled the shoes of Thexter's father, and they both knew it.  Like his real family, though, Thexter had to get away....to do more....to learn more.  Jundler watched as Thexter's plane lifted into the night, wondering if they would ever meet again, wondering if he would WANT to meet Thexter after his experiences in Isle Volett.  "Oh well", Jundler whispered to himself as the plane, gone long ago from normal sight, turned into a tiny dot in the horizon, "only time will tell."</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
