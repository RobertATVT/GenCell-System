I'm also not sure of where you got the additional +4 to your will but I lowered it accordingly as well.  I also added your *Gift* to you XP record.  Everything is good now though, enjoy :)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light" LANG="0"><I><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

The pair met in a hospital in Laos, where his father was flying for a US-backed transport operation.  The result of this union (though it was short) came in the form of a squalling baby, delivered in a hangar as his father was preparing to take off for a delivery mission.  His father did return for the mission, landing the battered DC-10 moments before an engine blew.  <BR>
<BR>
	His Mother, however, wasn't exactly so lucky.  She left Caleb with his father when he was 2, never bothering to contact the pair again.  And so, Caleb grew up an Air-brat, travelling with his father from nation to nation, whereever the government decided to send them.  He had learned to fly a small plane by his 12th birthday, Helicopters by his 16th, and at 18 became a member of the USMC.  They taught him how to fly in military zones, extracting soldiers.  One year after the training was complete, he was dishoorably discharged.<BR>
<BR>
	The truth behind the matter was that after his discharge, he became a "volunteer" for a government backed air corps.  Without any official ties to the military, Caleb and his comrades could extract everything from strike teams to spies to diplomats out of hostile nations.  Stationed in the Florida Keys, his major assignment was to get these people out of latin nations unfriendly to the US.  At least until, at the age of 33, he was shot down over Cuba.  After a moment spent in a Cuban prison, he was released..but without government recognition or aircraft, he couldn't get off the island.  After his extraction a year later, he officially retired, recieving in the severance package an old Cesna.<BR>
<BR>
	Well..that summed it mainly up.  With his career non-existent, he moved to Voletta, his father's hometown.  Through conniving favors, he managed to get the Cesna stored in an old hangar outside of town, flying it sparsely (no money for upkeep or fuel).  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
