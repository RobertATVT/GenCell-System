They design our buildings, our bridges and almost every structure we use today.  They ensure that what they've imagined actually can resist the forces of gravity, corrosion and the bottom line to become a thing of beauty.

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Michael Kriss was born on 1-24-77, in Portland, Oregon.  His childhood was easy, only having on brother, Scott.  As the two grew older, there interests grew further and further apart.  Scott's interests moved towards sports and hanging out with friends ect, while Michael's moved onward to technology, reading, and of course, computers.  Up through middle and high school, they both got along fine, never having a problem with each other.<BR>
	Michael had soon mastered everything he could that involved computers, actually knowing more than most technicians. During school, though, he was soon classified as a "Nerd."  Often picked on for his loner habits, he never had too many other  friends asides the kids that shared his own interests, which weren't too many.  He tended to stay secluded, preferring to soak up his studies, never having a lower GPA than 3.8.  Scott, though, was the typical teenage football playing slacker.  As they grew older, they both slowly grew apart.<BR>
	When Scott graduated high school, two years before his younger brother Michael, he went off to play College football at some college out east, staying on contact over the years by phone, and mail.  Meanwhile, Michael continued to progress through school, having started the Computer club, soon becoming the president of the club, everything was going just fine for him.  He continued to stay up to date on the leading computer software and hardware, oftentimes ahead of everyone else.  He held a part time job at a local Computer Maintenance and Sales center.<BR>
	When Michael graduated High School himself, he said his farewells to friends and family, heading off to attend the University of Northern Alabama, to major in Computer Science, of course.<BR>
	It was there that he met her.  Sylvia Prescott, Sylvia was a fellow student in programming, tall, black hair and Blue eyes.  Michael was instantly in love.  He did the normal introductions, although nervous, yet so was she.  The two held a lot in common, everything from favorite foods to Computer Brands.  Their relationship grew, as each of them fell more and more in love.  It continued to grow throughout their college years, Sylvia getting a masters in Computer Engineering, Michael in Programming.  The perfect jobs to coexist between a perfect couple.<BR>
	The date was on.  Michael and Sylvia were to be married in two months, just after graduation.  Things couldn't have been going better for the two.  They both had great jobs at a Computer firm, they were to be married, love was in the air.  Then disaster struck.<BR>
	Sirens blared and lights flashed as police and firemen tried to calm the scene.  The truck had never seen their car coming until it was too late.  When Michael awoke 3 days later, he only had partial feeling in his left foot, and had 6 metal pins and screws ect in his pelvis.  He was lucky.  Sylvia had perished at the scene three days earlier.  hen the news was finally broken to him, his heart shattered.  His life seemed to just fall apart right before his eyes.  <BR>
	Stricken with grief, Michael was having an even harder time recovering from his injuries.  His left leg being permanently crippled, he was forced to use a cane.  Over the course of the next to years of rehabilitation, his parents both fell victim to cancer, and Michael was once again a broken man.  His life gone, at the age of 21, he finished his rehab over the next two years, and set out to Isle Volletta to start a life at the age of 23.<B><BR>
