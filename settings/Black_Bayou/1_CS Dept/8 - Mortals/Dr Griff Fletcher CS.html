<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

						<B>Physical Description: </B>With a sharply bent nose, and cut facial features, Fletcher had spent his life enjoying his ability to boast resemblance to the Greek statue of Zeus. In his twenty-eighth year, his second as a physchiatrist, his habits are casual and precise, and he can most often be found in either Khaki slacks or a pair of semi-loose blue-jeans, with a white dress shirt tucked in over, and the same old, faded brown sport coat, with patches at the elbows. His physical appearance is hardly intimidating, but unsettling nonetheless. His arms are thin at first glance, but can quickly be discerned to hold coils of sleek muscle, faintly visible while relaxed under the skin, and drastically taut when flexed. His every motion is liquid marble, smooth and calculated, a picture of grace beyond his short years. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

	Having grown up in large, tourist swarmed Harrisburg, Griffin Fletcher had been desensitized to death since his early years. He and his companions spent hours playing games of Spaceman and Alien, (the recent Apollo 13 "Successful Failure" having left a strong impression on them), in which,  more than once, one or more children spent the last minutes of the game playing out detailed death sequences, in which they related aloud the pain they supposedly felt, and illustrated with words, (drawn between labored breaths, of course), their grotesque afflictions and injuries, everything from having been eviscerated to decapitated, with a careless manner. The Forefathers would have been sick. <BR>
	As he grew older, Griffin found himself to be a compassionate person. His friends, and peers, often came to him for advice in the range of troubles that plague young adolescence. By the age of 14, he had acquired a reputation for being a wonderful conversationalist, and many came just to tell him their problems, and carefully ingest his wisdom. It was then that he chose his profession.<BR>
	After graduating at the top of his high school class, he enrolled in nearby Pennsylvania State, with visions of becoming a well known physchiatrist. A Bachelor's in Physchology was quickly earned, followed by a second four year term, in which he gained his Master's, and Ph.D. A few weeks, an appeal to the Pennsylvania Board of Physchiatric Health, and a few dollars sent in the way of persuasion, he was a liscensed Physchiatrist. It felt wonderful.<BR>
	A year went past before his first incident. A patient was talking quietly to him about his childhood problems, and the trouble those created. He was confessing his dependancy on the doctor, and thanking him heartily for his help.<BR>
	Fletcher's first instinct was frightening. He had the sudden urge to completely crush the unfortunate patient, but quelled it quickly. Looking unbelievingly at the man, he glanced carefuly at his watch, and said something about time being up. The Man glanced at his own, and shook his head. No, he said, He had five minutes.<BR>
	This was where Fletcher lost it. Fearing for his, and his patients health, he stood, and started screaming for the patient to leave. The patient grudging did so, after quite a few loud exclamations. <BR>
	It happened more than once. After several of these episodes, he spent months confined in his own space. Unfortunately, his reputation was destroyed. His mental health was detirorating as well, as he found that he had problems keeping his anger in. Reluctantly, he returned to the profession with the few patients who would still take him. To help sooth his nerves, he took their company at his own home, in a lush Den, equipped with a leather sofa for the obviouse reasons.<BR>
	It was here that his first murder was commited. After making an exscuse to stand, he had left the room, found his hunting rifle, returned, and quickly shot his patient between the eyes. The entire process came naturaly, a homicidal blackout in which he felt only serene pleasure. It had been hell to dodge the police in the weeks after, but possible. On the other hand, he was forced to leave Pennsylvania.<BR>
	Voletta comes into play. Like so many others, he had heard of its seclusion and oddities, and went there to tend to his habits in private, and possibly learn more manipulative skills. It was said that a supernatural being known as the <I>Lamia</I> was located in dense population there, a being that relied on its power of mental supremecy to rule its captors. This intrigued him. The move was made quickly, and he stays there happily to the present day, where we find him, living on the coast in peace..<BR>
