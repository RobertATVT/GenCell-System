<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>Advantage:</B>   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="News Gothic MT" LANG="0">	Justin James Pembroke, a twenty-nine year old, was born in the outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio.  His parents, Andrew Ryan Pembroke and Samantha Crystal Clear-Pembroke, were wonderful role models to him his whole life.  His father a Sheriff's Deputy for the Portage County SD in Ohio, his mother a Prosecutor for the state of Ohio.  His only other sibling is a younger sister, Angeline Sarah Pembroke, she's five years younger then him.  <BR>
	He was your typical boy growing up, big into sports, and the physical violence of young boys divulge themselves into.  All through out Junior and Senior High Justin was on the Hockey and Wrestling teams.  Justin was a well rounded student, not only was he involved in sports but he was an honor student, graduating tenth in a class of fifteen hundred.  <BR>
	After high school Justin headed off to Penn State for college, there he earned a masters in Criminal Justice with a Bachelors minor in psychology.  While at school he started going by James due to his freshman year room mate's name being Justin as well.  From then on he stuck with James.  Very few of his friends these days call him Justin, only those from back in high school.  Retuning home after college he found himself an apartment a couple miles away from home and was hired by the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department in Ohio.  His father at this was elected to Sheriff of the Portage County SD.  Justin went through many job changes during his years with the department.  Such jobs included standard patrol work, undercover work, and a bit of investigation.  The Sheriff, Matthew Devens, of the Cuyahoga SD was a good friend of Justin's, an old class mate back in high school.<BR>
	One night when Matthew and Justin were off duty they had just left an Indians game and were headed to the parking lot where the car was parked.  A fight broke out only yards away from them, shots were fired and they pulled their own sidearms, badges clipped to their shirts, the raised the guns and started ordering out commands to the juveniles as other Deputies and PD Officers arrived on the scene.  Bullets came from behind the two, firing into the crowd of juveniles when they did not lower their weapons.  However, two shots were fired into the back of the Sheriff and one into the leg of the Deputy.  Sheriff Devens was rendered paralyzed from a bullet to the spine, his lower body no longer mobile.  Deputy Pembroke was released from the hospital in hours with minor surgery to his leg.  After that night Justin turned in his badge and resigned from the force.  After going through a year of psychological treatment Justin is out on his own once more, this time he's headed away from Ohio and down to Louisiana and a small isle known as Isle Voletta.  Living off savings and funds from family he's looking for a job, and a nice place to stay.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
