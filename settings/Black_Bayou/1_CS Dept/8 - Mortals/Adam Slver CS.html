The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

Advantage: Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> Background:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  Born in and raised in Indiana, Adam always felt removed from his peers, isolated.  He never seemed to have anything in common with those around him, and while his personality was naturally outgoing, these odd feelings led him to spend most of his childhood in isolation.  Quiet and reserved, he slipped through life with a quiet sullenness.  Things may have gone rather downhill for Adam, and had indeed begun to by the time he reached his teenage years.<BR>
    Salvation can come in many forms.  For Adam, it came in music.<BR>
    Introduced to drums by a friend, they quickly became his obsession.  He practiced obsessively, day and night, hour upon hour, honing his skills with a fervor he had found in no other part of his life.  He finally found a peerage he sought in high school music activities, from marching band to a rock band of his own, and his emotions finally had a throughput.  He also took up martial arts, specifically Kendo, the japanese art of competitive swordplay.  It seemed whatever he plyed his hand to, he gave the same boundless energy and fervor, and always managed to be successfull at it.<BR>
    After graduating from high school, he poured himself into music more then ever before, learning the guitar, and piano, and practicing them as ferverently as the drums, every day enriching and honing his talents further.  At 23, he has hit the road, seeking out a place where he can look for that illusive "big break", forming a band that can take him to the top.  Deciding to meet some old friends and fellow musicians, he heads to where, amazingly, five of those he knew in high school have moved to.  Amazing, because it's just a small, out-of-the way town, deep in the Louisana bayou.  A town called Isle Voletta.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>
