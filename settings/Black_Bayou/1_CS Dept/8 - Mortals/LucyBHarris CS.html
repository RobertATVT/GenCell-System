 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>She had grown up with the story of her father ever since she could remember. The ultimate love story of two young lovers. When her mother, still at the tender age of twenty three, had first reminiced the story to her daughter at bedtime, Lucy Christina had no idea how it differed from the fairy tales of Silver Knights and Damsels in Distress. But the time grew on from<BR>
 those carefree years, when Lucy was only five.<BR>
 	The large house on a tree lined suburb street was all that Lucy knew. From her earliest memories of Christmas's and Birthdays in the huge dining room, to the saddest times, when her granddad had died.<BR>
 <BR>
 Lucy Christina Harris sat on the plane as it soared gracefully over the hills and dales of America. The in-flight movie was, as she suspected, terrible. To the background sounds of 'Free Willy 3' in her earphones, she thought back to her childhood again, and how her life had changed so suddenly.<BR>
 <BR>
 If any couple's love could have been said to have stood the test of time, it was Lucy's Grandparents that she would have thought of. When Grampa Craig died, his wifes spirit seemed to leave with him. She became lifeless and mopping, spending her days inside the grand old house, rather than enjoying shopping trips, or playing tennis like she used to. It came as no surprise<BR>
 to Lucy's mom, Melissa, when Grandmother Marie passed on less than six months after her husband. But what came as no shock to Melissa, was still a horrible thing for the seven year old who adored her grandparents. The night after Granny's funeral, which Melissa Harris decided her daughter was too young to attend, Lucy sat in bed wondering what she did wrong to deserve such a life. A father who had been torn away before she was even born, and now two<BR>
 missing grandparents. All she had left in the world was her mom, and she vowed that night never to lose her.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Plane banked sharply to the left as it circled around the New Orleans airport. She had never before been so far away from home, or even so far away from the boarding school she'd called home for the past three years. A sense of something akin to apprehension washed over her as the seat-belt light blazed up, and she knew she was nearly home.. Real home.<BR>
 <BR>
 	The police informed Lucy, in the most gentle way, that her mother had felt no pain. He insisted that the head-on collision was so sudden, there was no chance Melissa Harris had suffered. Seven years had passed since Granny Marie had died, and for Lucy, death was a thing of the past.<BR>
 	Her and her mother had lived happily in the huge house, just to themselves. Melissa had never found a man to try to be a replacement for Lucy's dad, she'd never even tried. Being a single mom wasn't all it was cracked upto be.<BR>
 	But Death caught upto her in the most dreadful of ways. Interstate accidents, killing millions of people each year. Yet this particular day, it had suceeded in killing the one remaining person in Lucy's life.<BR>
 Of course, the police traced Mr Steel, the man who Melissa Harris had detailed in her Last Will and Testimony. And of course, he'd flown up to Washington from Lousianna.<BR>
 	It was the first time she'd ever seen her father, and for some reason she wasn't surprised. Ever since she could remember, her mom had told her the fairy tale of torn-apart lovers. She'd described every line on the twenty-two year olds face. The way a loose strand of hair formed a black comma on his forhead when he'd been running. The creases at the corners of his eyes when he joked and laughed.<BR>
 	But to him, at the sudden moment when he first caught eyes with her, he was bowled over. with the exception of her eyes, she was the perfect replica of her mother. Jake Steel (Eroz Dark) was stunned at the miracle that had created her, and for a time they stood silently. <BR>
 	The long weekend that followed, Jake caught up on as much of her life as she could tell. She knew, in her innocent fourteen year-old's grandeu way, that he was ashamed for not being a part of her life. She felt that sorrow too. She'd wanted to go back to Port Arthur with him, back to the place her mother called home all those years ago, but he'd resisted her argument. He insisted that she finish off her education, at least until she was eighteen,<BR>
 and then they would discuss her life. And so, as the monday morning drew near, they agreed, somewhat unevenly on her part, she remembered, that she would go to a Womens Only Boarding School.<BR>
 <BR>
 She walked briskly out of Customs, glancing around for the black hair that marked her father. They'd arranged, when she'd phoned about spending the Christmas Vacation with him, to meet just inside the airport terminal. She dropped the one large suitcase at her feet and leaned against a pillar for support. The flight had taken the energy out of her, more than she'd guessed, and her eyes felt drowsy. The hand on her shoulder was like a splash of cold<BR>
 water on her face, as she spun around, ready to slap whichever pervert was behind her. It wasn't until, hand poised high, she recognised the face.<BR>
 	In the three years since they'd agreed that she'd attend 'Madame Giselles Academy for Girls', she had only seen him five or six times. The entirety of those visits were in the first year, when he'd seemed eager to get to know his daughter. The last two years, however, something had changed in him. He flew to Washington less and less, and the gaps between phonecalls grew in leaps and bounds.<BR>
 	Those two years had been something different for them both. She had grown from a little girl into a woman. A startlingly attractive woman, Jake had to admit. She got all her physical qualities from her mother, he noted in that first instant at the airport.<BR>
 He, on the otherhand, had aged considerably. She could spot the first fragments of grey hairs coming through at his temples, although he still wore his long hair in a ponytail. His eyes had seemed to darken, and something was hidden behind them, something that she didn't want to ask about. Whatever had happened in those two years, she wasn't sure she wanted to know. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
