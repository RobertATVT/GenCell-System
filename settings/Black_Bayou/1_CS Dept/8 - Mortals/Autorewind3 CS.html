<BR>
<B>Adrenaline - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
Luck<I> </I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Gift</B> - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills.)</U>  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  <B><I>Brink of Death </I>- 1 Soul to use.  (##BrinkOfDeath##)<BR>
Generation Cost: </B>10 / <B>Experience Cost: </B>50<B> </B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Continuous; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>Ever notice how, just when the hero is going down, they make an amazing come back and strikes a blow for truth, justice, and the American way?  How about the bad guy that always comes back for one final scare? The ability to return from the brink of death is possessed by some Mortals. When the Mortal takes enough damage to take his Body statistic past 0, the character's will to live will drain it's inner force in order to survive.  No roll is required, but the mortal's Body must first reach-1 for this mastery to begin.  The Mortal loses 1 Soul and gains 1 Body.  This will work until the Mortal has either drained all its current Soul or returned to a current body of 1.  This ability may only be used once per night.<BR>

			</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><B> </B>A tall man who was once very friendly, however the world has scorned him into a killer, angry at the world and everything around.  He learned of a race of such things as werewolves and came to Voletta.  There seemed to be many a vermin there.  He grew up in Seattle and led a normal life.  He went to collage at the Academy and has stayed in the military since.  He was transferred base to base until they decided to send him out of town for "Peace Keeping."  It was here he learned of Werewolves as one had ravaged his base.  Anthony was one of the few survivors. The only one left with his sanity.  The FBI flew in the next day and talked to each of them.  Any who seemed to have any recollection of what *really* happened was shot.  Anthony saw this and told them what he needed to stay alive.  Which was absolutely nothing?  He left for home the next day and stayed in a Psychiatric ward in the Los Angeles County Hospital, the FBI insisted he stayed there until further testing was done.  So once he was released into the world again he asked to be relocated closer to Louisiana.  He knew that Werewolves existed there, he had gotten the info from one of the feds.  He was transferred quickly and here he is now.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SCRIPT" FACE="Comic Sans MS" LANG="0"><BR>
