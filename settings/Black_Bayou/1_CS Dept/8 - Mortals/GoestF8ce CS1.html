     System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
     Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Luck</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
     System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
     Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

     </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
     System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
     Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 System/Duration: </B> 2d6+Body+Music vs. victim's 2d6+Mind+Soul / Instant; this takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> For ages, music's soothing quality has been known to calm both humans and beasts.  Some musicians have learned to harness this quality of music, especially in their endeavors with those creatures of the night.  Any character which succumbs to the effect may not make any aggressive actions.  This includes attacking and using aggressive masteries or spells.  Although they <U>will</U> defend themselves, even though defending may potentially harm another.  If the player using this has lore level 3 for whatever breeds are affected, then those in their "true" breed form will revert back to their "mortal" form.  The player may not choose who is effected.  All characters who hear the music are affected.  The single die roll made by the musician above is compared to the rolls of all the individuals who are within hearing range (50 feet outside or the same room inside) to determine who is affected.  Meaning they may make no other actions, aggressive, defensive, or otherwise until the mastery has lost its effect.  The user may choose to end the mastery prematurely at the end of any round before the next wave of initiative begins.  On the other hand, the user may need stop the use of the mastery to defend themselves.  These effects are subtle and the victims will have no idea the music created the effect unless the musician is obvious about their intentions.  Remember that Steel Will is added to all Will rolls in the game.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
