 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER> </B>Years of experimenting with his hair has led him to what he thinks is the perfect color -- a deep mauve/burgundy hue that currently stains the tips of his short, jet black hair.  His complexion is an olive/coffee mix, belying his Irish adoptive parent's name.  Standing a slimly muscular five eight, he's slightly shorter than most of the other buff men of Voletta, but hey, who gives, right?  Right?<BR>
 Across his back lies a reminder of his tendency to leap out on a wing -- an ornate drawing of a tribal-enhanced cat.  It must be seen to be believed.<BR>
  His clothes are strange at best, irritatingly complex at worst.  His most common clothing is a pair of baggy skater's pants, duct taped at odd places to complement the piping of the original creator.  A bright yellow walkman is always clipped to his upper left pocket, the tape within only changed once every few months.  His boots and sunglasses are of the same screaming yellow, the hue almost damaging to human eyesight.. but not quite.  Teetering on the edge comes naturally to him.<BR>
 A switchblade, three inches in length, is usually slipped down the side of the left shoe.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Born to Abrienda Puro and most likely Mio Diezuno on January 8th, 1976, the baby was born normally, except that it had a caul surrounding the round, cheery face.  The nurse who cleaned the child smiled at the mother as she did her job, pronouncing that the child would have second sight, as shown by the caul.  His mother turned her face away from the child she was proudly shown, and asked to be let to sleep.  The adoption papers for the child would be quickly signed later that day, and he was given over to the first couple that asked for an infant, Michael and Catherine Donoghue.  They raised the child as best they knew how, but unfortunately, that was not quite good enough.  Catherine was the worst, flying into a rage when "that child" did not wash or prepare well enough.  Thus, at the age of ten, he was proficient at both running away and obsessive/compulsive behavior.  <BR>
  He most always ran to the Covenant House to find food and shelter, and it was there that he met the five other street kids that formed his surrogate family.  It was this family where he learned his first lesson in reality.  <BR>
  They decided that to set themselves for life, they should rob banks.  They revised the idea millions upon millions of times, sure that they could pull it off a couple of times, and have the money they needed for the rest of their lives.  It did work two times, but the third time proved to be the charm.  An alarm was triggered, and Liam lost his cool, and.. who knows what else went wrong?  But in the end, a friend was lost.  Joey was shot by a zealous guard, and in three days, guarded by his friends but without medical attention, he was dead.  The remaining five parted ways with their money, vowing never to meet again.<BR>
  "Con" first went to Atlanta, to take back a few favors from a man who had played him a few times too many.  His years after that are checkered with his work -- conning little old ladies out of their money, insurance companies out of their precious payments, and even the mob out of their hard-earned dough.  The obsessive rituals continue to this day, mainly in the routine of being perfectly in order before he can step over the threshold of his bedroom, no matter how long it takes, nor how many things he has to get right.  He thought he had rid himself of his past otherwise, living day to day, only in the here-right-now.  But then, a call from their ringleader, Gannet, and he's back to Louisiana for a second time around with the old gang.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
