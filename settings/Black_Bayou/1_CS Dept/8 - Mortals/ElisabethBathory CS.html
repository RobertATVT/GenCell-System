 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Adrenaline</B> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 <B>Luck</B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 <B>The Gift</B> - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Backround:</B>	Elisabeth Bathory was the Countess that tortured and murdered several young women and because of this she was known as one of the " true " vampires of the history. The Bathory Family lived in where we knew today as Slovak Republic. It's been said that she was Hungarian but that is due to the fact that in that time the Hungarian borders were not " fixed ". She grew in a property from the Bathory Family, in Ecsed, Transilvania. When she was a child she was subject the accompanied sudden illnesses of intense hate and uncontrollable behavior. In 1574, Elisabeth became pregnant from a brief " affair " with a peasant. But as soon as its " belly " was visible, she was hidden from everybody, because she was bride of the Count Ferenc Nadasdy. <BR>
           Elisabeth married him in May of 1575. As he was soldier, Count Nadasdy passed most of the time in campaigns that the Countess had to assume the duties of taking care of Savar's Castle, property of the Nadasdy Family. It was there that her malign career really began, with the "teaching" of a big number of employees, mainly young women. She not only punished those that infringed her regulations, as well as she found excuses for severe punishments, delighting with the torture and her victims' death.	It is said that certain day the Countess was being combed by a youth maid, when the girl accidentally pulled her hair. Elizabeth turned to her and beat her. The blood sneezed and some drops were in Elizabeth's hand. When scrubbing the blood in the hands, these seemed to take the girl's forms jovias. It was starting from this incident that Elisabeth developed her reputation of wanting the virgin youths' blood. Conde Nadasdy not only participated in her wife's cruel acts as he taught to her new torture forms. He came to die in 1604. After his death, Elisabeth moved to Vienna and soon, after sometime she moved to the Solar of Cachtice, the place that was the scenery of her more vicious and famous acts. A second history speaks about Elizabeth's behavior after the death of her husband, when it was said that she wrapped up with younger men. In one occasion, when she was in company of one of those men, she saw an old woman and she asked him: What would you make if you had to kiss that old witch "?. The man answered with scorn words. The old woman, however, when hearing that dialogue accused Elizabeth for excessive vanity and increased that such appearance was inevitable, even for a countess. Several historians have been tying the death of Elizabeth's husband and that history, its concern that she to take a bath in blood because she feared to grow old. In the following years after the death of the husband, Elisabeth got a new companion for her sadistic acts: a woman called Anna Darvulia, who is not very known. When the health of Darvulia it worsened, Elisabeth went back to Erzsi Majorova, a local farmer's widow, her tenant. And it seems that this was the responsible person for the Countess's decline because she motivated her to include among the victims, women from the nobility, by virtue of the difficulty that Elisabeth was having to get new maids (or they would be victims?). After all, the Countess's fame and its behavior were already known by all the villages around. In 1609, ELisabeth killed a noble youth and she hid the fact alleging suicide. In 1610, the investigations about the countess's crimes began. Actually, it was more for political reasons (Count Nadasdy had lent money to the King and this wanted to see free from such loan confiscating the Countess's latifundium). Even so the suspicions of her murders, were plus than an excuse to sum up the plans of the crown. With that, on December 26, 1610, Countess Elisabeth Bathory was arrested and judged some days later.During her judgement, several people affirmed that she bit the girls' body that she tortured. She was accused then of drain the blood of her victimsand of taking a bath in that blood to retain the youth. On January 7, 1611, it was presented as test, a diary contends all her victims' names, registered with its own letter. In totality they were 650 victims. Besides her murderess reputation and sadistic, she was still accused of being a "werewolf" and a vampire. Due to such supernatural suspicions, no one wanted to kill her in fear of an ungodly retort, instead Elisabeth was Imprisoned in a tower, and died soon thereafter.<BR>
 	It was this Historical figure which became the obsession of the young Elizabeth Bauldaire. Born in Austria on August 2nd, 1970, Elizabeth was a protected child all her life, for the main reason that she was her fathers pride. She was taught via a tutor, and although rather calculating was never a one for memorization of useless facts. As she grew, she bloomed from an ugly toad of a child to a stunningly beautiful woman, becoming far more noticed to men at this point, however she paid them little to no heed. She held a fierce hatred for her father, the lone family member which had always kept her isolated from life for all those years. Eventually her father raped her, and kept her locked in her room during the daylight hours. After months of having sex with her father, something inside Lis' head simply clicked. She went completely mad and slueth her father, there after going on a short killing spree and taking upon the alias of Elisabeth Bathory, a woman who was much like herself. After such an bloody string of events she was left by her lonesome, having to survive by herself without aide from anyone. Having traveled a small portion of asia, she made her way to the states.. Having put up the facade of being the "Blood Countess" she truly believes herself to be the actual Elisabeth Bathory, and often has self-composed flashbacks of events she was never there to witness.. After having wandered through the states a bit she now resides in Isle Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
