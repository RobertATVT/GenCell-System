They are called many things from Stage Hand, Entertainment Assistant, Makeup Artist, Best Boy, Grip, Lighting Director, what have you.  These are the people who actually make the magic happen during an entertainment event.  They apply the make-up, they make sure the lighting is just right and ensure the smoke pots will ignite right on cue.  They run the mixing boards and the laser light shows.  Without their creative talents, Metallica might look more like The Dixie Chicks on stage...and The Dixie Chicks more like the Grinch who Stole Christmas.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>     Lance is 6' tall, and about 150 lbs. He has a average build, but doesn't work out, so he isn't muscular. He wears gold-frammed glasses to read, and has that intellectual look.  He has blonde hair with dark roots, always kept short and combed forward with gel. His navy blue eyes go along just right with his tan skin, having gotten it from living in California's Los Angeles.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>    Being born into a family of a computer programmer and a  stunt coordinator, Lance has always been one to use his mind. His father taught him the basics to programming with BASIC, VISUAL BASIC, C++, c+++, PROTOCAL, and several other comper programming languages. Though taking interest, he spent most of his time learning how to use makeup, mixing boards, and other devices used for special affects. <BR>
     Around the age 15, Lance got into hacking, from changing passwords on his friends computers to looking up adresses of people who were unlisted in the phonebook. This continued, and as he learned to program, he got better at manuevering around watchdogs and fire walls.<BR>
     Attending college at Yake for a Masters at age 20, Lance excelled at using special affects equipment and was getting better at programming, and hacking. His parents wanted him to come back to Los Angeles to work for a studio of some sort, but he refused, and found out about Fairlight, a company based in Isle Voletta, Louisianna. <BR>
      This led him to research more about the city, and found out some very interesting things. There was several growing companies, such as Omsferd Investigations, Myacron Managing Inc, Fairlight, and even a porn video chain, a even better reason to move their. Using money from doing hacking jobs and crashing certaint internet sites for "friends", he bought a small house on the beach. (Security and description in Vincent house SL) <BR>
