</B>Government agents have a number of different origins.  From the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Central Intelligence Agency to the highly secret National Security Agency.  These organizations are deeply rooted with sub-organizations so clouded in secrecy that they often don't recognize each other in the field.  All Player Character government agents begin as a low ranking field agent for whichever agency they belong to.  Also, you never know how many ex-agents there are lurking in the shadows...just what is their angle?<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Tellen Sinclaire was born into a wealthy Baltimore family.  His father was a high-ranking offical deep with in the National Security Agency.  Because of this agency's secrecy, Tellen was unaware of what his father did for a living until after his father had died.  When Tellen was 17, his father was leading an investigation of a bombing of an American nuclear launch site in Turkey.  The terrorists who had planned the bombing broke into Tellen's parents house and burned it to the ground.  Tellen's mother and father were killed.  Tellen lived with his girlfriend's family until he went away to school. He went to Westpoint, and served in the military for 4 years, before someone noticed him, and had him transfered to Intelligence.  He worked there for 7 years, before he made the decision to follow in his father's footsteps and had himself transfered into the NSA. <BR>
	The NSA uses its field agents for missions too dangerous and to risky for both the FBI and the CIA.  Tellen worked in the middle of crisis all over the world for 2 years before being transferred to Voletta.  Today he packed up his desk and went home for the two day break before his transfer takes effect.  His buddies from the agency who have made it out of Voletta alive have been calling him to tell him their horror stories.  Tellen, now 33, almost drools over the idea of the chance to see some real intense action.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
