  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  <B>Effect/Description: </B>Ever notice how, just when the hero is going down, they make an amazing come back and strikes a blow for truth, justice, and the American way?  How about the bad guy that always comes back for one final scare? The ability to return from the brink of death is possessed by some Mortals. When the Mortal takes enough damage to take his Body statistic past 0, the character's will to live will drain it's inner force in order to survive.  No roll is required, but the mortal's Body must first reach -1 for this mastery to begin.  The Mortal loses 1 Soul and gains 1 Body.  This will work until the Mortal has either drained all its current Soul or returned to a current body of 1.  This ability may only be used once per night.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Effect/Description:</B>   Haidee was the only woman ever truly loved by Don Juan.  Imagine the greatest of lovers only truly opening his heart to one woman.  Such is the power of love.  A force sometimes as strong as the tides.  Sometimes as steady as a mountain.  Based upon this connection that some Mortals have for those they love deeply, they sometimes are able to sense danger almost on a psychic level, to their loved one.  The sensing takes the form of a vision, that seems to flash across the lover's eyes.  These visions occur at anytime the loved one feels an extreme emotion.  Hate, fear, happiness, and lust are only examples.  They will know exactly what is happening to their loved one, though they will not know any details except for a 30 second flash of seeing through the eyes of the loved one. Also, should someone attack the object of the Mortal's Haidee, their love will be channeled into a blind rage.  If the lover focuses their soul on the rage, they gain +4 to all attack rolls for the remainder of the scene. This bonus is only applicable after a physical attack causing damage to the Beloved, which is witnessed by the Mortal visually or via their 30 second vision.  The loved one must be stated during character creation, or role-played over a month's time in the game.  Should either loved one die, the Haidee is lost and may never be purchased by either character again.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Background:  Juliet Michelle Meyers was bought up by both of her parents in the upper class neighborhoods of Manhatten.  She was fortunate in always having her parents there for her whenever she was in trouble, or needed help.  Her parents, who were Shakespeare buffs, named all of their children after characters in some of their favorite plays he had written.  Since she was a little girl, Juliet had always been a little extroverted.  She had two sides of her personality: one was her constant search for excitement and the other was a want to become more knowledgable.  These seem like completely opposite traits, but that was Juliet.  Another thing that she has had since her childhood was her disgust for snobby and/or arrogant people.  Nothing got on her nerves more than some people.  Her childhood was, for the mostpart, was a happy one, though she was a victim of the "middle child" syndrome.  She had an older brother, Anthony, who did excellent in his studies, and a little sister, Olivia, who was always the baby, the one who got most of the attention.  It was not as severe as most cases so she did not stress about it too much.  Other than that, she had an almost perfect childhood.   At age 6 a frightening thing happened to Juliet, causing a reverence towards her brother.  SHe had been throwing a beach ball around with her other cousins close to the pool, when the ball fell into the water.  Juliet thought nothing of it and reached as far as she could to get a hold of the ball.  Unfortunately, she fell in and what was worse, she didn't know how to swim.  She started panicking, kicking with her feet, and trying to breathe air instead of water.  She soon fell weak and went under.  By this time, her cousins had run into the house and told everyone what happened and the first person to rush out was her brother Anthony.  He immediately jumped into the pool and pulled Juliet out of the water.  Luckily, nothing detrimental happened.  From then on, she strived as best as she could, to be just like him.   And so, like her brother, she also did well in her studies, academically and athletically, being in track and the swim team, earning trophies in both, while maintaining a 3.8 GPA.  While in high school, another formidable thing happened to her: her father had developed prostate cancer.  Once Juliet found out, she was totally devastated.  For weeks, she would just stay in her room and cry.  Her grades started to drop dramatically from high A's to low C's.  All her family was sick with worry.  Fortunately, after chemotherapy and radiation, the cancer was defeated.  Juliet determined that it must have been the work of her amulet that her brother had given her.  From then on, she hardly ever took it off.  She enjoyed her company with all her family, not taking any of them for granted after her father's full recovery.  Juliet attended UCLA, majoring in psychology, where she met up with her soon to be best friend, Gena Kilcher.  They had a really good time together and were roomates all through college.  Suddenly, in the middle of her Junior year, her older brother Anthony tragically died in Isle Voletta, being stabbed to death by some unknown assailent.  Juliet was crushed because she had always looked up to her brother and now he had mysteriously been killed.  She had to find out why.  So then, Juliet went to Voletta to find out about Anthony's death.  However, no one had ever even heard of him, and the case was still unsolved.  Juliet tried and tried, but to no avail.  Soon, she gave up, tired and alone, and stayed put, partly because her brother had died there and partly because she had grown a little accustomed to the strangeness of the whole place.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
