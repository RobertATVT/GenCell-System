<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some mortals have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Born into a family of old Southern money, Antoine had it made from birth- his acceptances to college, law school, and an elite fraternity were already assured, legacies of his father and grandfather. And, what's more, Antoine <I>knew</I> he had it made, a fact that he didn't hesitate to revel in and lord over the help. Almost from the time he could understand what words like "money", "wealth", and "privledge" meant, he's gotten what he wanted, when he wanted it. This made him, in short, a spoiled little boy that's grown into a spoiled man. He has committed various petty crimes, from petty theft to drunken bar fights, but he's never been to prison- or, indeed, to lock-up- because his family's lawyer keeps him out of trouble as a matter of course. In fact, the law firm's number is on the speed dialer of the cell phone Daddy gave him- right after the bank.<BR>
<BR>
	Only two things mar this idyllic lifestyle. The first is that he can't access his trust, which has an estimted value of several million dollars, and the second is his now dead grandmother.<BR>
<BR>
	The key to the trust lies in the special conditions placed upon it- if he doesn't meet them, by spending at least four months of his 21st year in Isla Violetta, then he can't get his money. <BR>
<BR>
	And his grandmother, whom Antoine hated, is the one that set the trust up.<BR>
<BR>
	His grandmother, Marie, was a spiteful old witch- literally. When Antoine was born, she used her magic and foresaw two things: one, that he would be a "spiteful, viperous, shallow little dilettante," and two, that somewhere, a spark of something... special... burned within him. And so, when she set up the trust, she made his time on the island mandatory, believing that the power there would call to him and awaken him- hopefully to become someone- or something- better than what he was. <BR>
<BR>
	Years have passed, and Antoine is now 21. His college courses are a joke, his grades already bought and paid for- and so, using spring break as an excuse, he's made his way to the Island, for the purpose of satisfying his grandmother's wishes and thereby gaining the entirety of his trust when he comes of age.<BR>
