   <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
   <B><BR>
   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
   <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
   <BR>
   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
   System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
   Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human soul is known to manifest itself during desperate times of need.  During times of intense fear or when faith is the only thing they have left, mortals tend to reach deep down into places they didn't even know existed and harnessing this energy from everything that makes them mortal.  As a result, the player may add +8 to the next Faith roll their character makes (only applies when a the Faith skill is used).  This mastery may only be used once per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

   	The brown bear lives atop her head, leaping in fine tendrils over a peach forehead and galavanting across elf-like ears.  Eyes much too dark to be blue glare into the night, surrounded by heavenly darkness.  Lips, tainted a nectar of light peach(brown if the eye chooses so), curve in a most sensual way.  Is this the fox that she claims to be?  The fox that can bare teeth if need be.  The red fox that speeds through forests at lightning speed and gallops over obstacles as if they were rocks?  Yes, this is her.  The legendary fox, ready for battle.  What looks say, they are not.  The cute n' fuzzy fox may cause the next body rolling into the morgue.<BR>

   	An adopted child, she never knew who her parents were.  Left at the Maybury Hospital for Children when only the age of three months old.  They were Jason and Iveta de Massard, which went on to Cloe's name of Massard.  Her name was attached to the anklet found about her ankle.  Cloe Rose de Massard.  French that is.  Sister Margarette of the local church(St. Peter's) found her upon the doorstep twenty seven years ago, crying out for the love she needed, and picked the bundle up.  From then on, she was under the Sister's care.<BR>
   	Kept at the convent, one would expect Cloe to live a pure life, but the sisters taught her more than she bargained for.  More than she needed to know.  On December 25, 1986, when Cloe was 16, the Father of their convent was found murdered.  He had been "stabbed" twice in the neck, and all the blood has been drained.  However, there was none left on the pavement, and he was excessively pale.  Cloe had read about this, about beings called "vampires", about the myths, and about the facts.  She had had her Cross(fashioning Jesus dying on the cross) blessed the day after by Deacon Fitzgerald.  The sisters were mournful for years after this loss, and tried to tell Cloe that it was not vampires, though she insisted.  She began to read.  Every book she could lay her hands on, she read of these monsters.  The Roman Catholic religion was guiding her to Christ, yet she was stone to their teachings.  She did not believe in half of the rituals, or sacrifices.  She believed in her relationship with God, and the knowledge that evil was more abundant than good.  The cross never leaves her neck, nor does the vial of holy water(Silly myth).  She gave up the garlic at the age of nine.  Now she is on a journey, having left the convent behind(though they had begged her to stay), to find these creatures, to speak with them, and to avenge the Father's death.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
