  <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Born into a group of gypsies in the darker regions of 1920's Spain, Loralei came of age surrounded by loving family and friends. When only 2 year olds, Loralei's mother died trying to give birth to her second child, the child also died. The first 16 years of Loralei's life were quite adventurous as her family was very nomadic and rarely stayed in one place long enough to disturb the grass their tents stood on. Loralei saw many places and learned many skills. Her father, whom she had spent all her time with since her mother's death, enjoyed treating her as a son, for she was an only child, and taught her all the skills he would have taught a son. Loralei became very proficient at pick pocketing, conning, and basic theft, as gypsies used these skills to provide them with most of their supplies. When Loralei was in her 17th year, however, disaster struck.   <BR>
    A group of boys from a village they were camped close to let the horses go in the middle of the night. A small insignificant prank it none-the-less got a much larger response than they expected. A skirmish broke out between the village boys and the men from Loralei's group. The violence attracted a large number of people, lurking in the shadows, least noticable, drawn by the violence and scent of blood, was a tall handsome vampire who had stopped in the village bar for "something warm." The Vampire watched the fight rather unenthusiastically until Loralei, wanting to get a few licks in on the village boys herself, broke into the fight. He was immediately attracted to this 5'7 115lbs temptress with her long sleek black hair and bright sensual green eyes, not to mention her strength and aggression. Loralei, never sensing she was being watched as she was completely focused on the fight which she was thoroughly enjoying, was the first to see the boy draw the small dagger which found it's way to her father's belly. Letting out a roar of pure rage, Loralei lept at her father's murderer but was knocked aside by another of the boys as they ran off into the forest. As the gypsy men gave chase, Loralei attempted to stop the flow of blood coming from the gash in her father's belly. She soon realized there was no reason to as he died quickly. Loralei, in shock and disbelief, ran into the woods. She ran   till she could no longer lift her legs. Finally falling to her knees beside a river, she threw herself to the ground and began to weep. Loralei lay there for a long while weeping never knonwing she was once again being watched. This time, however, the creature did not keep himself hidden. One moment Loralei was on her stomach weeping and the next she was on her back lookng into the most menacing blue eyes she had ever seen. A scream caught in her throat as the creature placed a finger on her lips and purred, "Shhh, do not speak until you have heard me out." "I have just witnessed the death of your father and the escape of his murderer. I have also been witness to your strength and courage, both of which attracted me to you. I know you want nothing more now than to catch the boy who killed your father, but I can promise you you will never find him without my help. I have a gift for you that will help you to hunt him and his to the ends of this world if you wish. The gift I offer you will give you added strength, reflexes, and immortality. You will never again see the light of day, however, nor will you again see your family. If you choose to accept my gift they can never know what I have given you." Loralei listened in horror to everything the creature told her. Disbelief had kept her from struggling until now but it no longer held her. She began to fight and claw at the monster saying these terrible things but found him unmovable. Terror took hold of Loralei as she realized her attempts were feeble to say the least. Slowly seeping over the terror, however, was  the realization of his strength. Strength being one of the things Loralei craved most, she was highly attracted to this offer. No longer having any family left alive and rage still burning in her heart over her father's murder, Loralei accepted the creature's offer. And so begins Loralei's hunt that slowly but inevitably leads her to Louisianna and the startling Isle Voletta..........</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
