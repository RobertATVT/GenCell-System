<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

	Small, Intelligent and above all, Serious.  She arrives in Voletta after a being relieved from her position with FBI and the "Fallen" case.  Born into a family of true law abiding citizens, it was Melissa's duty to her family to take a position in law.  However, instead of following in her father's footsteps and becoming a lawyer, Lissa majored in Medicine fulfilling her wanting to be a doctor.  But as time passed, Lissa became disinterested in medical practice, and found herself leaning toward her duty, law.  Instead of dropping medical school, Lissa continued and began taking classes in Law and Criminal Justice.  After graduating from college at age 26, Melissa began her first job at the law firm owned by her father.  After her first case, her father decided that she wasn't fit for an attorney.  She gathered information well but she could not handle herself in court.  Melissa found herself lost, unable to be lawyer or a doctor, or could she?  She disliked having to deal with people for long periods of time, but those people were living.  She started her first job in medicine as a coroner's assistant.  He was a long time professional in forensic science, and taught Melissa everything about forensic medicine.  After two years of autopsies and investigating crime scenes, the coroner died mysteriously in a car accident.  Melissa replaced the coroner and was required to perform the autopsy on her former boss.  What she discovered was shocking.  According to the results, her boss was long dead before the car accident.  Futhermore, his entire body had been almost completely drained of its blood and was decomposing at an amazing rate.  Three days after the death of her boss, the body disappeared from the morgue.  Baffled why anyone would do such a thing, Melissa looked to the FBI for answers.  She was turned away and told that any information relating to that case was now classified.  The cause of death was deemed an accident.  Two months later, while she was working in her office at the morgue, she received a phone call.  The voice on the other side sounded remarkably like her former boss and told her that she'd best forget what she saw or risk the same fate as him.  Chilled, Melissa left the building and made way to her car.  On the way she was attacked, the man had to be her boss, but it wasn't possible, he was dead.  But he was dead, or rather undead.  He readied to embrace her but was interrupted by a security officer who heard Melissa's screams.  The next morning she was visited in the hospital by the FBI.  She was immediately given access to the information she'd requested and hired to work on the "Fallen" case.  As she delved into the information put before her, she was shocked that a whole other race of people have been living among humans for centuries.  She also found a hit list, locations of "Fallen" who had a record and were kept under constant watch by the FBI.  One of these places was Voletta.  There were other hit lists - other breeds - for Voletta, too, but she was denied access to this information. Two years into her work, she was contacted at her office.  This time, it was a group of vigilantes, vampire hunters, who were in fact an underground group run by the FBI.  This group was hoping to that Melissa would leak information about the location of certain vampires.  She refused and never heard from the group again.  Six months later, the underground group was uncovered by the CIA and traced back to Melissa.  To avoid an international incident, Melissa was relieved of her position, despite the fact she had done nothing wrong.  She chooses Voletta off the hit list and moves to the town in hopes of picking up her work once again, with or without the help of the FBI.  <BR>
