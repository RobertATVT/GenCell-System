These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

Standing at 5'7" and weighing 120 she moves in timid yet daring fashion.  She is often found in slightly baggy pants and a lose fitting t-shirt.  Almost always slung over her shoulder is a backpack in which she carries her journal and pen so that she misses nothing always ready to jot it down.  Her hair is cut short framing her face nicely with her light perscription glasses.  Though she may give the appearance of being shy at first a closer look would tell people that she is merely taking in atmosphere and the people around her into he thoughts dwelling upon them. <BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Born in Birminham AL. in the later part of the year 1977, Cassandra  Blaylock was born into a good family.  Not to rich and not to poor.  Just right in the middle.  She was an only child, infact the only child her mother would ever be able to bear.<BR>
<BR>
	She grew up steadily with her loving family making average grades in her class and having a few friends her and there.  Slowly though it was realized that Cassandra was never able to be found to close to reality.  She could often be found floating around with her own thoughts day dreaming about the would around her.  <BR>
<BR>
	Slowly as she made her way through High School, Cassandra's parents began to wonder if what they had thought might be just a show of creativity would actually be one of their worst fears.  They feared that Cassandra was slowly becoming incapable with interaction with others as she preffered to be alone thinking to herself than with others of her age.  As she seperated herself from the world around her they consulted a psycologist.<BR>
<BR>
	By her senior year with no signs of improvement Cassandra was going to be sent away to a mental institution to help her become associated with the life around her once again.  Cassandra found this out and ran away quickly leaving her parents heart broken.<BR>
<BR>
	Cassandra began to travel with what little money she had making the best of what she thought was a happy life.  In the process she eventually once again began to make friends her and there in her travels.  <BR>
<BR>
	This wasn't however her only asperation.  She still wanted to learn what she could.  She still wanted to look at life at every possible angle.  She still continued to write in her journals.  For her the journals weren't just ideas and  oppinions.  They were a story waiting to be told.  She will show no one her stories until she feels they are complete.<BR>
<BR>
This is why young Cassandra Lea Blaylock has come to Volleta.  Maybe it's just another chapter in her story...Or maybe it will be a whole other story in the making.<BR>
