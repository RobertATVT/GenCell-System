System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Luck</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

	She sits across the booth from you with one of those 'looks' etched on her face.  You know, the one that says: "You don't like me?  Then go [ ] yourself."  But I like her just fine. That is why I have sat here, for near on 3 hours, amongst the bitter cups of coffee and stale cigarette smoke.  Her nearly black eyes--they remind me of tar--regard me and she asks if I think she is crazy.  I have always been a sucker for honesty.  I tell her, I do.  But crazy and pretty have always been my 'thing'.  That rouses a chuckle from her, as she lights another menthol, tossing the close-cropped, rust-colored hair and drawing a knee up to be caught between her chest and the table.  Lounging there, small frame folded haphazardly and all together  unlady-like, she reminds me of a child.  The large, watery eyes, tiny, upturned nose and pouty, rosbud lips give her a most innocent appearance.  But I have never been easily fooled.  Her face is layered with a certain hardness, a kind of solidity that the girlish features seem pressed to.  If I wasn't watching her as close as I am now, I might have missed it.  I don't claim to be a psycologist.  I don't claim to be much of anything, but I can see the calouses behind her shaded eyes.  She is far from innocent.  And I guess that is what drew me too her in the first place, that strange mix of child and woman all packed tightly into this swearing, smoking nymph.  I do my best now to describe what I see on her face--tell her just what I think.  Foolish perhaps, but the ever easy conversationalist, I am not.  She frowns.  Man, is that the most attractive frown I have seen.  I think her face was made to frown, as if smiling just never fit quite right into the downward angles of her creamed skin.  She is asking me if I want the rest of the story, now.  She says she doesn't do the analyzing bull [ ]--that the world is full of sanctamonious philosophers who don't know diddly.  She says, around a mouthful of minted nicotine, that I should keep my opinions to myself.  I sit silent for a moment, looking over the picture she presents--the ragged, woman-doll before me.  And then I just laugh, not meeting that challenging stare she offers.  Did I want the rest of the story?  Of course, I nod.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>A Repeated Story</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
	"I don't care if you believe me.  I know how [ ]ing crazy I sound.  When I was a little girl, my dad used to scare me with all the routine monster stories.  You know, dragons, ghosts, werewolves..vampires.  The same tall tales I'm sure you were told when you were young.  Of course, as we all get older we learn that things like that don't really exist.  The tooth fairy isn't really the one putting quarters under your pillow.  Santa Claus isn't really the one leaving presents under the tree.  As we grow up we accept the reality of the world around us.  So did I, so did you."<BR>
	Another menthol cigarette is lit and the diminutive, female form in front of you leans back casually.<BR>
	"So when I tell you that Vampires really do exist, I expect you to laugh at me, call me a loon.  You see, people don't want to hear that the world that they have come to accept is a farce.  And you know why? Because that would mean that they would have to question everything else.  Is there life after death?  Do things like angels and demons really exist?  Hell, does your husband really just go out for a drink with his buddies every other night?"<BR>
	A rough chuckle is issued, along with a toke from the cigarette, thick smoke blown into your face.<BR>
	"So, do you think I am rude yet? Lacking in manners?  Believe me, I have been called some cruel [ ].  To tell you the truth, I am surprised you have remained her as long as you have.  I mean, come on, just who am I to sit here and practically tell you that your husband is a cheating bastard, or even worse that Vampires exist?<BR>
	The woman leans forward, half smoked cig perching on the swell of pouty lips.<BR>
	"I suppose I can't say for sure that your husband is unfaithful, hell, what's less, I don't care.  But I can tell you one thing with all certainty.  Vampires are not just the scary stories that we have been told in countless movies.  That's right, look at me like I am bull [ ]ing you.  I'm not honey.  They roam the night.  They hunt us."<BR>
	The accumulating ash is tapped into a nearby ashtray and the woman leans back yet again, drawing a tiny knee up and folding her leg neatly under her.  A calm sigh is issued.<BR>
	"Do you want the whole story? I mean my insanity had to have originated from somewhere right?  Hell, I don't keep secrets.  As far as I am concerned if you have tolerated my [ ]ing ramblings this far, you should get the complete, uncropped tale.  Yes?  Alright then."<BR>
	Another long drag, bringing the cigarette to death on her cinnamon lips.  And then it is mashed into the ashtray.  She stares at you, as if trying to think of the best way to start.  And when she does start, finally after a sip from the squat coffee cup at her right, her voice is low, somber.<BR>
	"I grew up like every one else, you know, 'normal' family--dad, mom, brother, cat, dog--the whole kit and kaboodle.  Hell, I think we even had a station wagon for Christ's sake.  I finished high school, though my grades left a little to be desired.  I started college, yeah, tried the whole dorm thing, but that wore off fast.  The girls were prissy,  [ ]y sluts, and the guys, well, they all liked the prissy, [ ]y sluts.  Nope, wasn't my thing.  So, I came home and worked at a cute little café called 'Sylvia's'."<BR>
	The woman pauses, toothpick digits tapping lightly over the polished table top.<BR>
	"I met Saul, that same year.  I won't get into the mushy love [ ], but I will say that I hated him at first.  I've always been partial to blondes.  He was a cocky brunette, and smart ass to boot.  But as love goes, I found I had no control over what developed between us.  I fell head over heels.  And that SOB talked me into marrying him."<BR>
	The story is halted and the woman issues a gravely chuckle, fumbles around for another cigarette, then decides against it and tosses it onto the table in front of you with a feminine huff.<BR>
	"I never smoke when I tell this story."<BR>
	Her hands are folded as if needing to prevent them from lurching toward the discarded menthol.<BR>
	"Anyway, I think I was 23 then, or just turned.  We commenced with married life, and had a great time of it.  We fit perfectly, though it surprised me to no end.  He could aggravate me like nothing else, then turn around and make me cry with his tenderness.  I was completely baffled by the hold the bastard had on me."<BR>
	She laughs again as a hand rises to brush at her lips, eyes darting away and then back to you.<BR>
	"We loved each other fiercely.  But I suppose the fates enjoy being cruel.  Who knows.  We had decided on a vacation.  It had been a year since we were married, and we both needed a little getaway.  There was a resort in Florida we were interested in and so made plans to travel there.  We arrived and spent several days filled with  laughing, drinking and wonderous sex.  Then on the third day, or night rather, Saul was taken from me."<BR>
	The woman uncurls from her position, waving a perky waitress over as she requests more coffee.  The cup is filled and she drinks deeply, clinking the mug down in front of her.  She regards you with a frown, which seems to fit her doll-like face perfectly.<BR>
	"I don't expect you to believe this part.  Hell, I barely believe it, and as I was saying earlier, it's just easier not to believe it.  Saul was killed by vampires.  I was attacked as well, and barely survived.  Don't look so stunned, honey, you knew it was coming didn't you?  [ ], I pretty much set you up for it.  Yes, he was killed by the bastards.  I watched the whole thing, screaming like a banshee, and struggling to get to him, but the one on me, had other plans--namely this."<BR>
	She leans toward you, nearly knocking the steaming coffee over, and moving the collar of her jacket.  A large scar graces the flesh of her neck.  Not bite marks, rather tear marks, as if her throat was ripped to shreds and peiced carefully back together.  She draws back and crosses her arms, as if that is the only proof you will ever need.<BR>
