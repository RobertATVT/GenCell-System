<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Growning up, Shawn had a hard life. He was born into the ghettos of ChicagoMost of his life he spent in the alleys looking for a way tomake money and help feed his miom and himself, dad had left him and his mom after he was born. He was ready to do anything to get the money,  even sell drugs, which is exactly what happened.  at about the age of 13 he started out small, sellin' weed to all his friends and then at 15 he went on to bigger and better things, Crack, Cocaine, LSD and anything else someone would buy, it was easymoney he thought until people started catching on to his routes and following him home.<BR>
<BR>
			One day there was an unusual looking balck car following him home after a days work. When he got home he walked into his house and looked out the window to the car and it quickly sped off.That night Shawn woke up to screams and loud gunshots going off, he quickly leaped from his bed to seewhat was gon on and he heard a man's voice yell "Search the house, bring me anything you find!!" while themen were searching one of the rooms Shawn quietly slipped out the door unheard.<BR>
<BR>
			Later that night Shawn returned to see what had happened, they had killed his mother and completely tore up everything that they owned and stole everything that he had exept for the two knives his grandfather left him, he hid them in a air shaft that flowed into his room and he took that and a few dollars he had stashed in the same place and hit the streets, living in aleys and doing a few odd jobs to get a few bucks.<BR>
<BR>
			Shawn met a man on the streets who tought him to survive and also tought him how to fight a little bit mostly he tought him how to throw knives. but then someone had to find him and had him thrown into foster care. This made Shawn madder than he had ever been, but he learned tolive wiht it. For his 17th birthday he got a computer and a phoneline for it. He met someone online who taught him all he knew about computers, this man was what you could call a "Hacker". When he turned 20 Shawn had learned to be a most cunning hacker. <BR>
<BR>
			At 21 Shawn htoguht it was his time tomove out and he did, syaing goodbye to his foster parents, he moved down south to Isle Voletta, Louisiana and got a room in an apartment complex and all he brought were his clothes and his trusty computer. Now Shawn is trying to find a job where he can use his skills.<BR>
