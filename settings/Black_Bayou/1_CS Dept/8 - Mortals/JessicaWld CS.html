<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  2d6+Will vs. 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate. <BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Effect/Description: </B> Some mortals seem to be blessed with a natural affinity toward animals.  With the use of this mastery, a mortal can calm an animal and befriend him for a time, be it wild or tame.  Simple, one word verbal commands given to the animal will be understood.  The duration can be extended with the expenditure of extra soul, no re-roll is necessary.  Shepherd's Aura has the potential to affect a breed while it is in an animal form, including Horus.  In any case, if the roll is against a player character, then the roll is vs the targets 2d6+Will.  These feelings tend to carry over to the mortal form and are viewed as "good vibes."<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Name:  Jessica Lynn Weilds<BR>
 Breed:  Mortal (Human)<BR>
 Age and/or birth date: 30yrs  11/10/69<BR>
 Eye Color: Warm Brown<BR>
 Hair: Raven Black<BR>
 Height/weight:  5' 7"  110lbs<BR>
 Occupation:  Advertising Consultant<BR>
 Equipment/weapons:  N/A<BR>
 Appearance (clothes, etc.):  Because of her heritage, Jessica is often seen in Native American clothing (mostly on special occasions).  However, when lounging around or just being casual, she's in the normal t-shirt and jeans.  Of course, for business, she's always in her tasteful conservative suits.<BR>
<BR>
As far as appearance goes, no one is going to mistake her for anything other than Native American.  What tribe she is from is a different story.  Her 'straight as a board' jet-black hair used to reach to her waist in her youth, but age now finds it hanging just to the beginning of her shoulder blades.  Eyes of warm brown are normally seen with a matching smile.  All of this is made even more striking by her yellow-brown skin, and perhaps she could have been a model, if she had more energy.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Background:  Born in Jacksonville, FL, Jessica Weilds lived a regular middle-class life.  Her parents, Melissa and Joeseph Weilds, were both employees of a small life insurance firm.  Times were never rough, nor were they extremely prosperous.  She was never a cheerleader, but her school life was still avarage.<BR>
<BR>
She went to college at Georgia Southern University and studied to become a CPA.  While there she met John Hill, and as often does she fell in love.  They were married when she was only 20 years old.  In the beginning, it was a wonderfull relationship, but by the second year, things had started falling apart.  John had become progressively abusive, to the point of one night putting her in the hospital.  They were divorced a short time later.<BR>
<BR>
It was a nasty proceeding, and left with nothing, Jessica fled to Isle Voletta.  There she met a few friends, and learned of a completely different life; the life of the pack.  A curious individual, John BlackCloud, promised to one day make her a part of his pack.  She was, of course, enthralled by the idea.  She started putting the pieces back together with the help of her friends Javin Winter, Rya Winter, and of course mother Syn.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly before the act was supposed to take place, another tragic event occured.  Her brother Ricky had died in a drunk driving accident.  Crushed, Jess left to heal yet another wound.<BR>
<BR>
Afraid to return to Voletta so soon, Jess went back to college and got her other degree.  But something gnawed at her soul.  After staying with a rather large firm in Savannah, GA for only three months, she quit and made the long trek back to Voletta.<BR>
