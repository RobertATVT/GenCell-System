System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Drake Ozstreicher is a man of great stature and above average strength.  His hair is solid black and reaches to the middle of his back.  It is either kept in dreadlocks or, on occasion, pulled back in a rubber-band.   A pair of black combat boots, a pair of black jeans or black shorts, a black t-shirt, and a black duster trench coat are his choice of special occasion wear.  For normal wear, his choice is a pair of baggy white pants or long white shorts, a silk shirt in the colors of the Brazilian Flag, and a pair of soft sole shoes.  He has a gold tri-cross ring that he wears on his right pinky finger, and a thick band on his left middle finger.  Around his neck is a Brazilian colored beaded necklace and on his face are always a pair of black wrap-around Arnett sunglasses.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Born to Joanie and Andre Ozstreicher on the 19 of October, 1974 in Sao Paolo, Brazil, Drake was born into a world of unknown truths and many lessons to be learned.  The family was quite wealthy for Brazilian standards.  They lived in a five bedroom mansion on about 60 achers of land, but "Oz" never had it easy.  He was to be taught the value of knowledge by his elders and the value of money on his own.  <BR>
	His grandfather, Pedro, also lived with the family.  He would give him all the knowledge he would need in life.  He began teaching him the beautiful "dance" known as Capeoira around the age of nine.  In time, Oz became better and better until the point he started attending local tournements.  Seven years, 40 trophies, and several broken bones later, his grandfather passed away at the age of 97.  This was a very difficult time for Oz.  His grandfather meant so much to him.  After the funeral, he sat in his grandfather's room and cried.  Remembering back to a time he broke his arm during a match, his grandfather told him,"get up, you're not hurt.  I want you to get back in there and win this match."  He stopped crying and got up off his grandfather's bed and saw a tri-crossed ring laying on the dresser.  He picked it up and he's never been without it since.<BR>
	After finishing High School, his father told him to get a job or get out.  He, unfortunately, got into the wrong line of work.  He got a job as a drug runner for the biggest pusher in Brazil.  He ran them to  Rio de Janeiro some 250 miles away and even brought some back.  The money was good, but the temptation got the better of him.  He held back on selling some of the drugs and kept them to make more money for himself.  Each day, he'd keep a little more  and a little more the next day and so on, and so on.  Soon, he made a quarter of a Million on what he'd held back on.  After a couple years, and many close calls with the police, he quit.  He now had enough money to live on his own forever.  <BR>
	After his father learned of him quitting, he told him to get out.  And so he did.  He moved out in 1995 and moved to Miami Florida.  Finally, the value of a dollar.  There, he got a job at a local night club as a DJ and also got into the car audio scene.  He competed around the state and was invited to the 2000 IASCA Finals on April 15, 2000 in New Orleans.  He read all about Louisiana and decided to stay after he attended the finals, so he sold his house in Miami, went to the finals and was scouting out a place live when he happened upon Isle Voletta.  "This town seems quiet...maybe I should liven it up a little."</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B><BR>
