</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  Appearance:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>She has a fit frame, muscular but keeping the feminine nature of her shape and grace.  Her black midnight hair falls to the mid of her back, and her breasts are ample enough for any man.  Her face is like that of a china doll, beautiful and delicate.  Her small 5' 3" frame looks very unintimidating, but don't let that fool you, underneath there is a true fighting machine.  Her skin is the color of freshly cured leather, and she always has the scent of Jasmine surrounding her body.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B>  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Originally born in China, her parents moved over to the United States to escape the persicution of the communist China.  Her father being a martial artist passed on the Martial Arts to his daughter seeing as how one day she may need a use for them in the future.  She had a fairly good childhood even if her parents didn't exactly get her everything she wanted.  She did all the things a physically active girl could do, she played sports, worked out to improve her back hand, and did a very good job in school too.  She was extremely bright in English, Math, and Social Sciences.  She graduated High School when she was 17 and then went onto college when she was around 18.  It was during College that she learned of the big bucks she could make from the martial arts her father had taught her when she was younger.  She also found she could model her body for money as well.  She soon droped out of college when she was around 20 to pursue a profession in the world of women's martial arts.  She did a fairly good job in that area.  She did that up until the point where she found she didn't like always either being mobbed by fans of hers, or by being asked by men to see how tough she really was.  She was around 28 when she retired from the world of professional Martial Arts, and so decided it was time to go someplace nice and quite..a place where hopefully no one would notice her ever again.  She decided the Isle known as Volletta would be perfect for her.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B>  <BR>
