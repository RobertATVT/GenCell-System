System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Name:	Hikaru Orimaru<BR>
Breed:	Mortal<BR>
Age andlor birth date: ApriI 4,1971(28)<BR>
Eye Color: black Hair: black, long, and straght Helghtlweight 511", 160 pounds<BR>
Occupation:	Professional hitman<BR>
Equipment/weapons: Magnun Desert Egale .50AE, High powered sniper Rifle<BR>
Appearance(clothes, etc~.): A long river of ebony silk cascades down over his shoulders to mid-back from a widows-peak halrline, and his skin gleams goldenly. High cheekbones arid a stralght, slender nose frame uptiIted eyes of liqud midnight, and full, sensuous lips curbed up in a knowng smile above a narrow, foxlike chin. Perhaps twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, he is lean and lithe, wth broad shoulders and gracefull-looking hands. A glance shows the wiry, banded cords of his muscular thighs delineated underneath the sharply-tailored black slacks of raw silk he wears; his upper torso is encased in a matching suit jacket and an expensiw dress shirt of such line, sheer white silk that it is possible to see the shadow of a slender gold chain around his throat underneath the fabric. A tie of blood-red silk is knotted around his throat, and the wst he wears to complete the three-piece suit is sleek black leather rather than silk. Gold glints in the lobe of his right ear-a tiny, plain ring-the watch on his wist is a Rolex, and his cologne is crisp and clean and enticing-a mixture of musk and ginseng.<BR>

The traditional Japanese value of honor is not one that Onimaru possesses, and neither does he bear the burden of regret over his actions in his still-short life. There is an ocean of blood on his hands, old and new, Orimaru is a ruthless, compassionless killer, favoring long guns such as rifles and shotguns over smaller weapons or hand-to-hand combat. A loner, he cares little for the company of peers-as he considers none his equals-or women, few of whom haw ever had the same cold, uncaring personality as his own, the one thing that would be necessary to gain his attention. Onimaru is firo Little Japan in Los Angeles rather than Japan itselt: his contacts among those streets are many and varied. Possible associations wth the Yakuza are hinted at by the vast number of tattoos on his golden skin, but if such connections exist, they hew yet to be confirmed by Onimaru himself, who simply favors any such inquiries wth a cold stare until the one asking backs off-or, if in less than a good mood, silences the questioner forever. Orimaru's reputation is whispered from the shadows, and aside from the hunt, the weapons, and the kill, his interests are unknown.<BR>
