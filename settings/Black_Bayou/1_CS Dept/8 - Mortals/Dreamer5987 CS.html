</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>Angel Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>  You have watched many Hollywood movies and that is where you get most of your knowledge from.  Of course, most of what you might believe is untrue.  You believe angels come in many shapes and forms.  You may believe they are symbolic in their presence and my not truly exist in the physical world at all.  If they did appear, you might assume they'd be large man-shaped creatures who can fly using their mighty feathered wings.  An angel is never seen without its golden halo hovering inches above its head, symbolizing all that is good in its soul.  Some will even believe they have a guardian angel constantly watching over them.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Faith Symbol:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>  Faith symbols for use against angels are nothing more than an inverted or disfigured faith symbol used by followers of the light.  They must be actual objects, not a pattern sewn into clothing, for instance.  The object itself has absolutely no power whatsoever.  It is the faith of the wielder that empowers the object.  Holding the faith symbol aloft, the character must concentrate, focusing their faith on the symbol and the angel they are attempting to ward off.  This requires a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs. the angel's 2d6+Soul+Faith.  If the character's roll beats the angel's roll, they are successful.  The angel must flee the scene immediately for the next 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  Nothing will dissuade the angel from fleeing until the duration wears off.  This is a blind panic and the only actions the angel may take are those that enable it to get as far away as possible.  Should there be no place to run, the angel will collapse to the ground, cowering in fear.  If the angel is successful, they may ignore the affects and will be immune to any further attempts of warding by the same character for 4 rounds / 2 minutes.  The failed use of a faith symbol will only serve to enrage the angel, causing it to attack the wielder as their next action however they are able, even if it is normally against their nature to do so.  It is not possible for one angel to use this warding method on another of its kind.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  Kendra was born on May 2, 1978 and grew up in Aurora, Colorado.  Her parents were rich and she always got anything she wanted. She has a twin sister named, Kami, and an older brother named Brandon. After graduating high school, she moved to New York City to take art classes at Parsons Art College, there she met an attractive blonde, named Josephine. They became room mates and became really good friends. After finishing 2 years in art college, she joined the Air Force, and was transported to Norad, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In only a few years, she worked her way from cadet trainee to Master Sergant, cunning them with her wits and intellect. From there she was transfered to Louisiana. One day, while doing routine parachute drops, their plane went into a nose dive, crashing into the Gulf of Mexico....Everyone was killed on impact, except for Kendra...who was declared missing. When she woke up, her face was buried in the sand along the beach of Isle Voletta with temporary amnesia and no idea of where she was or what was to come.  <BR>
