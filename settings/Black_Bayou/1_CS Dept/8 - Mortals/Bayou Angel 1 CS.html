<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0">Blaire was born to a life of nothing. Her father was an abusive alcoholic and her mother was a trampy waitress who also often drank as well as doing various drugs. Many times, when she was young, Blaire would run away and when she was found she'd be beaten and not fed. At school, she never had any friends because her clothes were awful and she hardly ever was offered the opportunity to bathe. When she got into high school, she got herself a job and bought herself the things she needed so she could fit in. Making friends was difficult for her though because of her childhood. She'd often times seem bitter and cruel to the people who tried to befriend her. So, besides a few people who learned to accept her for the way she was, she hadn't any friends. Her grades were always average, and she learned to eventually stand up to her father. If he'd hit her, she'd hit him back and it would result in brawls until one of them got really hurt or her mother came home and stepped in. She did smoke but never did she do drugs or drink. She saw what the effect it had on her parents and she would not let it happen to her. When she graduated she left home with the few belongings that she had and enrolled in the military. She spent about four years and then moved back to New York for a year. Getting painfully sick of the awful enviroment of the city she packed up again, and moved to Louisiana. Voletta, Louisiana.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>
