 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

She is far from being pretty, and her voice doesn't help matters, a low alto made gravely by choice.  Her clothes are baggy and well-worn, old tee shirts from bars and rock concerts, jeans that stay on her noon and night. There is no expected leather jacket, though she does have a quilted flannel coat in beige and navy blue plaid.  Her boots are steel toe, a construction worker's off-brand that she got on sale.  Her hair is short, at most reaching to her chin, and looks hacked as though she cut it without benefit of a mirror (An astute observation).  She wears studs in both ears, as well as another hoop in the left.  She has three tattoos.  One, an intricately worked dragonfly, covers a more hastily done homemade tattoo of a teardrop, and is located on her left shoulder.  The third is a line drawing of four one-inch claw marks, in the cleft of her lower back.  She has quite a few scars, the most notable being a thick one on her right arm from a bicycle accident, an uneven curved line on her upper left thigh, and a 'M' that seems somewhat unfinished on her bicep.  <BR>
 	<B>H</B>er body is uniformly straight in curvature, without voluptuousness in any way.  She is at a healthy weight for her height, and is actually a little leaner than she should be.  The first impression she gives is of androgyny, baggy clothes hiding any evidence that she is of the "fairer" sex.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>S</B>he was born in October, a few weeks early of her due date, the first and last time she was ever early for anything.  Her mother was a manager at a commercial laundry, her father a construction worker for a small-contract firm.  They were the kind of family that rides the brink of their class lines, holding grimly to the upper hand they had in the working class.  She was named after the city her mother had always wanted to see, Verona, Italy, a symbol for her mother's romantic side and the source of all the family's problems.  Her mother felt trapped in the working class, and by way of escape, turned to her soap opera fantasies and the bottle.  <BR>
 	<B>C</B>ontrary to stereotype, her mother was not abusive.  She was quite embarrassing when she drank in public, but that happened less and less often as she stopped enjoying her nights out with her husband and lost more and more of her will for the life she had been given.  By the time Verona was in her senior year of high school, her mother was stuck in the alcoholic's cycle, moving from job to job, "forgetting" to come or just plain quitting, and starting all over again after a good period of bingeing.<BR>
 	<B>V</B>erona actually applied to college under her mother's urging, and just squeaked into the accepted list of applicants to the University of Rochester.  College was a learning experience in more ways than one, as she was exposed to the limits of the fabled college education as well as a new kind of society she had never known existed.  She met Aileen in her freshman year, and the girls formed an unlikely friendship.  Aileen was the first openly homosexual woman that Verona -- now dubbed Ronnie -- knew.  Through her friendship with Aileen, she slowly made the acquaintance of much of the gay student body, daring to place herself in the company she had been told was perverted and sinful.  It took her another two years to realize why she was so jealous when Aileen went out with other girls, and another year to work up the nerve to out herself to her friends.  She was lucky, if a bit misled about the opinions of the outside world, to have a tight-knit circle of friends that supported her in the decisions she made.<BR>
 	<B>S</B>he persisted through four years, earning good grades with a C+/B- average and graduating with the senior class.  Her graduation, however, left her with no sense of purpose, and without the proximity of her friends, her safety net.  She began to feel the loneliness of her differences of dress and sexual orientation, and started to feel the pull of alcohol that her mother had felt.  <BR>
 	<B>T</B>he transition to alcoholism was slow and insidious, establishing itself into her life quietly and easily.  Social drinking turned to drinking at home by herself, job hunting turned to nights spent staring at a wall in her apartment.  She barhopped a great deal, switching from place to place as she lost favor with the bartenders there.  Her girlfriend left her after quite a few sleepless nights when she didn't come home at all.  <BR>
 	<B>S</B>he, unlike her mother, was not a likeable drunk.  She broke things, screamed, cried a great deal and became violent over stupid things.  One of the worst things she ever did came from one of these outbursts, and it landed her in jail.  The courts called it "Assault with a deadly weapon", but it was just stupidity, plain and simple.  She saw her ex a few weeks after they had broken up -- quite painfully -- in front of the same bar they had always frequented together, accompanied by a young, attractive woman.  She was drunk at the time, and managed to get herself in a fight with her ex's companion.  She was on the worse half of the battle when she pulled out a knife and slashed the girl's right thigh and shoulder.  By the time the paramedics came, they were both bleeding and held apart by others.  <BR>
 	<B>R</B>onnie was sentenced to three years in court, plus time in Alcoholics Anonymous.  She went sober under the sponsorship of Gerard Montgomery and was paroled after a year and a half of jail time.  It is a section of her life that she would rather forget, despite the good that came out of it.  While she still occasionally does work for her friends from jail and some other, less-than-legal work, she has gone clean for  years and has stayed straight with the law since her incarceration.  <BR>
 	<B>I</B>sle Voletta is another stop on the road as she wanders from town to town, feeling the strings of her life and ignoring the purposelessness of her driftings.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
