<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Justin can be described in several ways. Dark. Foreboding. Handsome. His facial features are delicate. His skin is fair, leaning a little heavily towards pale, but still mostly fair. He clears six feet with a little bit to spare, weighing 234, he's an athletically built human being. It comes from hopping fences as a kid.   Yes, one might say he is a good looking man. He's not incredibly gorgeous, but he's definately above average. Though it doesnt show when he's fully clothed, behind his right shoulder is "777," as well as a pheonix emerging from flames on his right ankle. Though he's not a superstitious man, he does believe in luck. Pheonixes also fascinate him. The whole idea of birth through death. He likes to think the triple sevens will help him out. Has been contemplating on whether or not to get a "13" tattooed on behind the left or something, but so far hasnt done it. He wears black. and lots of it. While he's riding his motorcycle, he wears black leather pants and jacket. His visored helmet's also black, and it successfully hides his face, except when staring into the sun. Otherwise, he wears a high collared black trenchcoat, a black t-shirt with the head of a howling wolf over the right pec, and black loose-fitting-but-not-baggy  jeans, and black gloves to keep from giving out fingerprints. He hides his switchblade in these jeans.. using it solely when his guns cant be used. Sniper rifle is kept in a black leather briefcase, his pistols <BR>
hidden in his trenchcoat.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Some people have luck. Some people dont. Simple fact of life. Justin does not. But this particular enemy of fate didnt take it well. He didnt become depressed. He didnt become optimistic about the "good things in life." And most of all.. he didnt get screwed up, at least not in the way they are on Loveline. This particular unlucky one took it out on others.<BR>
	Justin Lightman, a native of Oakland, California, was born to Phil and Lilly Lightman. His dad was a construction worker, alcoholic, wife-beater, avid believer in child abuse, devoted racist, and king jerk all rolled into one. Lilly was a victem of love. She'd long since lost affection for Phil, but knew if she left him, he'd come after her with a lead pipe. She was a good person, charitable, though she couldnt really afford to be, a pacifist, too. She wasnt very religeous, but it didnt seem to be a real character flaw for her.<BR>
	Justin got very little from his parents. He was a "B" student in school, though he was capable of As.  School just didn't work well with him. The teachers were sympathetic with the boy, having so many bruises all over. But they wrote it off from school yard fights. Something he was both fond of and good at. He spent so much time in the Principal's Office that he knew the guy on a first name basis. He ran in with a bad crowd, too. One thing he wouldnt do, though, was drugs. He felt it impared his ability to beat the crap out of people. He was a fair sized kid. Little scrawny when he was little, but he could hold his own. He could benchpress over 100 pounds at age 13. Not much more, and he could only do it 20 times.<BR>
	He had lots of girlfriends, mostly from the bad crowd, and he didnt do anything behind their backs. He didnt think he had to. He also got sick of his parents. His dad beat him, and his mom kept making empty promises. "It'll get better," she would say as she tended some open cuts his father's ring had made,"You just wait." But things never did get better. His dad had a nice handgun collection, too. He waited untill they were asleep, then he shot them both. With a bunch of friends to help him, he put a dead body of about his size in there, and burned the house down. This event happened at age 14.<BR>
	The firemen didnt get there in time. The bodies inside were completely destroyed. With his own fake death, he lived life out in the world.  First thing he did was head out of Oakland.<BR>
	He lived on the land. He'd get into brawls for cash, occasionally stealing. Lure a victem into an alley and... POW! Over the head with a trash can. He saved up some and bought guns on the black market. His two pistols, and his sniper rifle. First he bought a single pistol.. a year later, he bought another.. then he got himself his switchblade.. and finally, after being trained in there use by some old guy who wanted a student, he got his sniper rifle. Isnt the black market great? No serial numbers on anything. His "Mentor" Joe Winston, gave the kid three silencers. Looks like he wanted an assassin. Well, Justin liked the idea.. he liked it so much he put his silencers in and shot Joe between the eyes.<BR>
	Now, with a stolen Harley, 14 years after he killed his folks, he's on his way to Voletta. Why? Because.. it's just a sleepy little town. The perfect place to hide out, hone his skills...<BR>
