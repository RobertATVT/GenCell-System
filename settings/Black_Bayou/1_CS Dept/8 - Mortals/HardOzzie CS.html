 </B>Government agents have a number of different origins.  From the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Central Intelligence Agency to the highly secret National Security Agency.  These organizations are deeply rooted with sub-organizations so clouded in secrecy that they often don't recognize each other in the field.  All Player Character government agents begin as a low ranking field agent for whichever agency they belong to.  Also, you never know how many ex-agents there are lurking in the shadows...just what is their angle?<BR>
 <BR>
 <B>Advantage:</B> Field agents are trained to hit the targets they take aim at, and will only do so if the situation meets the requirements of their training.  All agents gain +3 to their Sure Shot skill and their jurisdiction overrides any local law enforcement.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Clay was born on the 24th of April, in the year 1973.  Threw his life, he has always been studying for things ahead of time.  Clay completed college with outstanding salutations in federal law enforcement. He was quickly accepted into his job, and worked very well under others.  He was drafted from place to place later in his job however, and could not see his family as much as he wanted to.  This forced Clay to eventually quit his current job, and go  out to see his family.<BR>
 	Already when Clay was 13 he could quickly analyze and figure out a persons problem.  With this skill he easily found a persons character flaws, and advantages.  He used this to get though live a bit easier, but at the same time it pushed him down.  He saw his own weaknesses, and watched silently as his life spiraled downward.  This brought about his depression, and lessened his interest in other people.  You could tell by how red his lips appeared to be because his skin was pale.  He usually stayed in side during his younger years, listening to the radio and watching movies.  Not your run of the mill movies, but usually ones that gave moral, and education.  This is how he learned to get threw his subjects in school, seeing how the teachers could not teach.  This is how he got into highschool, and into a good college without spending much money.<BR>
 	Before leaving his job, Clay learned many martial arts skills, and got a black belt learning pakua.  He learned this and gained levels in marksmanship as well,and in time was acceptionally good in small arms.  He went into a school that taught him how to use his first gun.  He used this with deadly accuracy, and got up to the 5th level of Marksmanship, almost able to shoot the dots off of a dice.  <BR>
 	His patience is unbelievable considering the amount of anger stored up inside of him.  At the age of 15 he got into a fight with his classmate because he couldn't take the jokes anymore.  He got brought in for questioning, and the cops figured the other guy had started it.    He never got caught by the cops, but was often chased because of the crowd he was with.  He was the only one that never got caught only because of his amazing adrenaline.  However, recently things have not been going as planned.<BR>
 	As far as getting into other peoples business goes, he wants to get involved at the same time he doesn't.  Actually, he knows he shouldn't, but he wants to.  He is, in old terms, a man of mixed emotions.  He got involved in other peoples business however, just after he quit his job (which was why he got involved, he thought he could handle it because of his earlier job...ahehe) which added up to how much he discouraged it.  Anyway, it seemed these people were going hard on his only friend.  Words went to fights, fights went to matters of life and death, and now his fighting style couldn't save him.  His friend got killed, and he got a broken arm in the process of killing them.  The cops brought him in for questioning, and it was proven as self defense during the trial.  <BR>
 	From then on, he was emotionless.  He worked, and left, and relocated in a repeating cycle.  He wanted to die, and in returned beacon Isle Voletta.  Now with his knowledge of alot, his gun, and his fighting style he goes to this place to find a new life.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
