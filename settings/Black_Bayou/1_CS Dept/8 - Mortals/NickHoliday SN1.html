Need to find someone, something, or find out why something happened?  Then these are the people you want to know.  Need dirt on your political adversary?  This is the person who can get it.  Need to get rid of an adversary?  They can also find the guy to do it.  Bury your skeletons deep....they can be found.<BR>

<B>Advantage:</B>  Informants usually will work for anyone that is looking to have a source of information.  This, in and of itself, is not inherently dangerous, until the other person finds out who passed on the information. Give out the right information about the wrong person and someone may soon be asking what happened to you.  An Informant receives a +2 to any Fast Talk skill roll.<BR>

Adrenaline - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<BR>
Luck - 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
The Gift - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. (Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills).  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  Nick Holiday is the embodiment of casual.  His 5'11, 176 lb. frame is something of a contradiction, as he stays in decent shape, but looks to be in a state of perpetual relaxation.  His jet black hair has grown just long enough to be brushed out of his eyes every now and again.  Those eyes, being a deep sort of green, hold a mischievous sparkle, as if he were constantly enjoying some private joke, complimented perfectly by his cocked grin, usually framed by a lazy bit of stubble.  He dresses nicely, if<BR>
comfortably, in slacks and denim shirts, jeans, and thin leather jackets.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Dominic "Nick" Holiday, was born on Nov. 8th, 1973, in San Francisco, CA.  He grew up in an apartment over his parents' deli with his older brother, Mitch, and his younger sister, Gwen.  Space was cramped, and money was usually pretty tight, and these two factors motivated Nick to spend a lot of his time on the streets of San Francisco.  He has always been charismatic and easy-natured, and he made friends easily.  Had he lived in a better neighborhood, he probably would have made much nicer friends, but such was not the case.  Mitch, on the other hand, spent most of his time working in the store with their parents, Bill and Janice.  Mitch didn't terribly approve of Nick's carefree lifestyle and shady circle of friends, and ooften lectured Nick on responsibility, and about Dad's failing health, and how Nick should stop hanging out with hoods and start helping support the family.  And that's when Nick decided to go into business.  At the age of fifteen, he became an errand boy for some of the lower level crime figures in S.F.  Because people felt so naturally easy with Nick, he started to learn a lot of somewhat confidential information, which also turned out to be quite profitable as well. over the next four years,  he started bringing home a fair amount of  money from his odd jobs, with Mitch being the only one who suspected the money's origin.  Mitch knew about Nick's illegal pastime and he despised it.  Because if Nick spent more time at the store, he might have known that some of the same people he was dealing with were behind a couple of gents charging "protection" fees from his parents.  <BR>
	When Nick did learn of this, he told his big brother not to worry, it was just a little misunderstanding that he'd take care of.  Nick voiced a complaint to his primary employer, one Eddie Gennaro, of the squeeze on his family.  Eddie knew it to be the work of one of his rivals, the DeGassi's, and  performed a little "counter-protection" and things were back to normal again.  For a little while.  <BR>
	Within the next year and a half, Eddie Gennaro was killed.  And the DeGassi's went about reclaiming all of their old territory with a vengeance.  Remembering the fuss that went down over a certain deli owned by a certain Irish family, they felt that it was a slight that could not go unchallenged. <BR>
	Bill Holiday died at 3:17 a.m. of a bullet to the chest.  <BR>
	Mitch told Nick that he thought it was time for him to leave.  His mother never knew about his roundabout involvement in his father's death, and Mitch said he'd never tell her or their little sister, if Nick just left.  <BR>
	Since then Nick has made a living as a middleman, a fence, and a smuggler.  A damn good one, at that.  But he's never gotten involved in the deeper "business" matters.  He claims no allegiance, and works for the highest bidder.  But he maintains his neutrality.  Since he's moved out, Mitch has run the store, taking care of mama and Gwen and eventually getting married.   Nick keeps in tough with his mother, sending regular checks back home to take care of her medical bills.  As far as she knows, Nick's in the import/export business.  <BR>
	Nick has most recently been living in Texas, and has been running his business between Texas and Miami.  He's passed through Isle Voletta more than once along the trip, and has taken a shine to it, thinking it a nice place to lay low between jobs, and also close to New Orleans, a nice major port city.<BR>
