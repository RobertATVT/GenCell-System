I adjusted your modifiers to fit your skills and Stats.  Also, Special Effects is only at level 5 with the occopation, not 8, so that was adjusted as well.<BR>

They are called many things from Stage Hand, Entertainment Assistant, Makeup Artist, Best Boy, Grip, Lighting Director, what have you.  These are the people who actually make the magic happen during an entertainment event.  They apply the make-up, they make sure the lighting is just right and ensure the smoke pots will ignite right on cue.  They run the mixing boards and the laser light shows.  Without their creative talents, Metallica might look more like The Dixie Chicks on stage...and The Dixie Chicks more like the Grinch who Stole Christmas.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>Description: </B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Louise strikes his watcher as a tentative man, often very cautious, and almost suspiciously quick and shifty. Despite his obvious carefulness to the world around him, Du Lioncourte is a very humane man, caring, and often doomed by his own tendency to love with abandon for his usual captiousness. Though his presence is commonly fleeting, it is often helpful, and marked by a flash or any other amusing trick done to set a fellow lover at ease. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<I>"Europe is nice, yes...but it does so smell!"<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>This was the only bit of advice given to a small, well brought up and groomed woman who was preparing herself to emmerse herself in a new culture, shortly after graduation from an ivy league school with full honors and a degree in foreign affairs. America and its strict moral and social code was stifling, and she soon found herself staring longingly towards the sky every time her thoughts strayed from her work as a consultant to a large international company. Though the money she made was fantastic, and she had the opportunity to loose herself in dozens of romantic affairs, the day came when she could no longer hold on to her well being in the U.S. <BR>
	The very day she decided to leave, a British class Concorde speedbird was hurtling towards Paris at 1130 miles per hour, both afterburners lit, nose up and locked as the passengers were pushed into their seats by the faster than sonic speeds; amongst the smiling Americans and foreigners alike being pummeled by the incredible Mach-1 capability engines was the small but rich woman who had set her heart on the narrow streets of France. <BR>
	She found love faster than anyone may have expected. His name was Khayman, and he had instantly dazzled her with tricks and illusions until he had gained enough of her attention with flattery to ask her to be his. They were married in the largest, most ancient chapel that the law would allow, among a private throng of her family and friends, and simply his friends. It was odd, but she had never met his family. It bothered her little at the time, and they embraced happily at the end of the ceremony, with both sides chearing loudly. A bang went off over the lovers' heads, and sparkling embers fell into each's hair. Another trick produced by the kind and loving Khayman du Lioncourte. <BR>
	More fireworks flew on the honeymoon.<BR>
	Enter Louise De Pointe Du Lioncourte. Born to his small, nameless mother who died during labor with him and the now bitter and hurt father, Khayman. With only his son to rely on, the crafty man spent all of his time teaching the boy to cause great flash-bangs to occur on his own will. As he grew, he was given the best education possible, care of his deceased mother's family and will, while, at the same time, Khayman taught him everything that a child could know about tricks at what he called "magic", often aided by his friends in the guidance of the boy. <BR>
	But as time wore on, Louise lost his childlike faith in all that his father said, and as the emotional bond strengthened and matured, the simple mental bond that only children can create crumbled, and a much dissapointed Louise found himself unable to work the old spells of  bright flashes and unexpected booms. His father, unable to help, was hurt further by his son's lost ability. <BR>
	In an attempt to regain what was once his, Louise abandoned his medical studies to become a special effects artist. He found that as a stage assistant, he would be taught the very best tricks of the trade, and, in the 4 years between graduation from a private highschool in London and his studies in the magic of special effects, he had learned to be a master, and was capable, though not in the same fashion of old, to do many of the same tricks he had missed. <BR>
	It wasn't enough. He wanted the power that was his by birthright. Though he hardly understood the blood which coursed through his veins, he was intent upon strengthening it, no matter the cost at which this knowledge came. Through his computer, he spent hours tracking reports of unrealisticaly good tricksters, until he found one inparticular magician: Nitram Talhalshia. His circle of friends had indeed also been known to cast similar tricks, and, instantly interested, Louise packed his equipment and left Europe, headed for the City in which Talhalshia manor was located, and where Nitram was most often seen: Voletta. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
