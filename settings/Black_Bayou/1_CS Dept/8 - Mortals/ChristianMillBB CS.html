 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B> </B>Born filthy rich, his family made sure that he got the best education possible. He graduated highschool at age 16 and went to MIT where he majored in Physics and studied lores and other sciences. He's truly brilliant. After studying at MIT for several years, he quickly left for Voletta to be with his sisters. <BR>
 <BR>
 His childhood was pretty easy for him. He quickly went to the best private school that money could buy where get got a fine education and gradutated by age 16 with a 4.0 GPA. He then got into MIT and recieved his first PHD in Astro Physics when he was 19. The then recieved Quantum Physics, Common Physics, and just about every other kind of Physics PHD possible by the time he was 22. After that time, he began reading up on Legends, Folklore, and Myths and recieved a PHD in that field as well. During his stay at MIT he studied such things as advanced chemistries, the hardest math courses possible, and he even managed to take a few geography classes before his stay ended. He's just recently finished with his last PHD, thus closing the final chapter of his stay there, and has travelled to Isle Voletta to be with Family. He's almost always got his head in some sort of new book about the Sciences and keeps constant track of each and every book he owns. They have become his pride and joy.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
