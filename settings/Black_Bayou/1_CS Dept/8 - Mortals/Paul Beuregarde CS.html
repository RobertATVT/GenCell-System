<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></U>	</B>Paul Beuregarde was born in New York City on August 21, 1974. He was the child to proud parents Jon and Lillian Beuregarde. He had a fairly normal childhood, even through his father's occupation. Paul did not know it then, but his father was the head of a large corporation in Japan, whose main game was the elimination and erasure of important political figures. This is why the trouble started.<BR>
	On his sixteenth birthday, Paul came home from basketball practice. It was dark, and as he entered, he saw black shapes moving from the house. He turned on the kitchen light, and saw the sight that would scar him forever. His parents were both lying on the floor, nude save for ropes tying their wrists. They had been beheaded by some unknown party, and Paul vowed to find out who it was.<BR>
	Paul joined his father's corporation as an assassin. He was taught the arts of ninjitsu. For this reason he still wears a shadowy trenchcoat, and carries a katana and a Beretta. He worked for his father's superiors for nine years, before he finally found the strength to leave the dread occupation for good. <BR>
	This is not his first visit to the Bayou... He has lived there before. It was there that he found out that a government operation to remove assassins had been the cause of his parents' deaths. After various unpleasantness in the dark city, he left. He vowed never to return. Something strong calls him back... He has found the truth. No one ever leaves the Bayou for good ... at least with their souls still intact.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>
