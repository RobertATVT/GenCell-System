 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
 <B><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 Joshua Roldier walks into the symp. He looks around with his green eyes.  He is a looking man.  He wears semi casual clothes.  His fathers necklace around his neck, which is a silver necklace with a silver circle and a rare crystal in the middle.  His hair is a light brown.  He has a scar on his right arm that is not noticable.  He walks over to the bar and sits ordering a drink with his bass-like voice.  He looks down at his pager going off, damn the hospital he rushes out and drives off in his 98' Jeep Wrangler.<BR>

 Joashua Roldier.  Born and raised in a suburb of NewYork.  He lived a normal life as a boy.  He went to a local school.  He had two brothers Kevin which was 2 years older and Michael which was five years younger.  His life was normal and fine until one day.<BR>
 It was around Christmas time and Joshua's dad, brothers, and himself went out shopping.  They were going to go to the local mall.  They were passing under a tunnel when a car came flying around a turn running from a police car.  The car hit Joshua's forcing it into a pillar in the middle of the tunnel.  Joshua's arm got crushed, leaving a scar on his arm.  That wasn't the worst of it though.  Joshua's father went through the window because the airbags didn't go off.  his younger brother was knocked unconsious, and his older brother snapped his neck making him paralyzed.  <BR>
 The ambulance rushed to the scene.  They got Joshua out nice and easily.  They had to rush the other three to the hospital.  The doctor's could not save his father.  His father's last word's were take this handing him his great grandfather's necklace and he told him to take care of the family.  He had sustained to much injury.  His older brother has stayed in a wheel chair ever since.  As for his younger brother, he had stayed in a coma for about a week when all of the sudden his heart stopped.  <BR>
 This event had made Joshua a different person.  He never really talked to people very much.  He had decided to go become a doctor so that he could save other people.  During his free time he read a lot getting interested in a supernatural being.  Psychics.  <BR>
 He has grown up and is now out of medical school at the age of 26.  He was working at a loacal clinic.  He quit from there very soon since it wasn't what he was looking for.  He had heard about an Island called Isle Voletta.  He had heard that there were many patients down there and a busy hospital.  He had got the first flight in to apply for a job not knowing what was ahead.....</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
