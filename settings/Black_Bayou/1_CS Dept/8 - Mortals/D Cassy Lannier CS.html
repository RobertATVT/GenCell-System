  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Luck</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some mortals have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  <B> </B>Darma Cassidy was born to a small family in Jay, Maine.  She has long blonde hair that curls slightly in the humidity and flashing green eyes.  This seemly frail woman is quick to move and graceful due to her martial arts training, which she had started when she was 5 at her fathers request.  Living in an all Catholic home with an ex-marine for a father was rough enough but knowing that you were different was even worse for her.  She ran away from home when she was 13, swearing that she would never hear another relative make fun of her religious beliefs again.  With pentagram in hand and a backpack slung over her Jean jacketed shoulders she headed out for the great American Road.  Her first night out she learned why her father had demanded that she have lessons, with a bloodied eye and a limp she left her would be attackers in the snow.  She holed up in a cave system and lived off the lands for the winter.  Only once did she think of returning home that first winter.  The night that a she wolf moved into her cave.  There were a few tense days and after that the two went about their lives.  She travels in the any weather and only holes up when the worst of it keeps her from seeing her feet before her.  She is most often seen with a leather pack over her shoulders and a faded old denim jacket.  She loves her long "hippy" skirts and will stay on extra long in a particulair town if she can get several made in a pattern that she has taken a fashion to over the years.  She favors black tee shirts and "granny boots" that lace midway up her calf.  She wears her hair loose and sometimes uses the scarf that she always has around one of her wrists to tie it back.  She carries a cheap tarot deck that she is familiar with and a small carving knife.  It is with these that she makes that small amount of money that she needs to carry on in her little style.  Reading tarots to the passer-byes and carving small locket charms out of all types of wood.  She answer to either Darma, Dar or Cassy but she rarely gives out her full name. <BR>
