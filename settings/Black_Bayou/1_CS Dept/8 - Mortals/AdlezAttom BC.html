<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

5'7", average weight, with short-cropped golden-brown hair, tan complexion, and strong muscles.  She has a slightly mousy appearance, pointed nose, slanted eyes, and a pretty smile.  Kay is slightly near-sighted and wears perscription glasses or contact lenses.  She's definately of no particular ethnic group, but looks like a very thick mixture.  Clothing-wise she dresses rather casually when not working, limiting herself to jeans, blouses and sneakrs.  If she's working directly with the animals, she sticks to the basics, a tightly-woven long-sleaved, ankle-length jumpsuit and gloves, with goggles to protect her eyes.  She leaves off the glasses and wears contact lenses instead.  Doing accounting work she dresses in dress-suits, pants-suits, and casual outfits, and will usually wear her glasses.<BR>

      Kay Landers is the middle child in a large, close-knit family that owns and opperates its own animal training company in Isle Voletta.  She, like her parents and her sibs, has a licence in animal training, as well as a 2-year degree in accounting.  Because the business is family owned and opperated, she handled the financial matters for the group.  Her specialization is working with canines, particularly wolves and wolf-hounds.  She has also handled bears, tigers, and horses, though she's not as good at handling them as she is wolves.<BR>
       Moriah is an angel who brushed with evil at the beginning and the war in Heaven.  Although she had fought on the side of the light, when the fallen angels were banished from Heaven she chose to go with them, feeling that the punishment was too harsh and that they were treated unjustly.  For some centuries she lived her life as a demon.  However, she grew sick of the Darkness, and begged forgiveness and to be allowed to return to ranks of her brethren in Heaven.  It was granted, but since she was "tainted" (at least in her own eyes), Moriah requested not to work with mortal humans, but rather with animals, working as their overseer and protector until she had completed her penetance and could be trusted around humans again.  She answers directly to St. Francis of Asisi.  Her assignments were large carniverous animals, particularly wolves.<BR>
       One day while in the middle of shooting a clip for a TV comercial, Kay was working with some of the wolf-hounds her family ownes when an electrical malfunction set the stage she and her animals were on on fire.  Kay and her family managed to get out, along with all but two of the hounds.  When the fire was under control and extinguished, Kay went back inside to find one of the animals alive but dying.  She prayed for assistance.  Enter Moriah.<BR>
       Moriah, meanwhile, had been reassigned.  She was to begin work, not directly with humans yet, for she had not totally complteted her required penatance, but rather with the group known as lycanthropes.  Werewolves.  She was in the vicinity of Isle Voletta when she felt Kay's prayer and went to assist.  Kay, being rather devout, was the perfect subject for hostdom for Moriah, and she was in total agreement to it so long as her pets were cared for.  Thus, Moriah joined with Kay Landers and healed the wolf-hound with Gift of Life.  <BR>
       Kay still works as an animal trainer and accountant for her family's practice.  However, as Moriah Kay, she's also become devoted to the dual task of caring for both Werewolves and their potential victims.  First, she's something of a "guardian angel" to weres, and second, it's her responsibility to tend to the victims of were attacks and prevent the attacks from occurring.  She's still somewhat timid around other humans, but is an excellent angel.<BR>
