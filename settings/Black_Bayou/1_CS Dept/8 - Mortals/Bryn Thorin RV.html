  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

Although they will defend themselves, even though defending may potentially harm another.  If the player using this has lore level 2 for whatever breeds are affected, then those in their "true" breed form will revert back to their "mortal" form.  The player may not choose who is effected.  All characters who hear the music are affected.  The user must continue concentrating throughout this masteries entire effect.  Meaning they may make no other actions, aggressive, defensive, or otherwise until the mastery has lost its effect.  The user may choose to end the mastery prematurely at the end of any round before the next wave of initiative begins.  On the other hand, the user may need stop the use of the mastery to defend themselves.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  ::You hear these words delicately wrapped in sweet Southern accent::<BR>
  I was born second daughter to the Monroe's of Savannah, Georgia.  Marie and Gregory, to be exact, as if you didn't already know.  Yes, I'm talking about THE Gregory Monroe, President and CEO of THE Southern Bank.  That's my Daddy. :::with almost a mocking tone in her voice:::  I'm the baby of the family :::She rolls her eyes at that and takes a seat on the couch offering some tea like a "good" hostess... programmed for every social function/occassion:::<BR>
  <BR>
  Well, I must admit I've never had an interview quite like this....  :: She peers at the person sitting directly across from her with the ANT nametag::  I simply want to visit my sister, Mist.  :::She pulls out an envelope from her pocket with return address marked, Voletta, LA:::   This is the letter I received from Mist inviting me.  I've never heard of a place that interviews visitors.. ::nervous chuckle:: but then again, my sister never would pick a common place to hang out.. always living on the edge.  Anyway, you want to know about lil' ol' me, right?<BR>
  <BR>
  Well, like I said, I'm the youngest.  Momma and Daddy's "Pride and Joy" they call me. Daddy even called me PJ for a short time when I was little.  Well, MY childhood was pretty much a wall to wall social calendar event.  I had ballet, piano, gymnastics, cheerleading, formals, balls, finishing school.. name a day of the week and I had SOMETHING grooming me with Southern graces. Except Sundays, that was reserved for church.  My faith in the Great Creator is what gets me through every day, knowing He's there by my side, supporting me.  How unlike my father... oh he's by my side, he's just... well.. let me continue on with my upbringing and perhaps you'll understand.<BR>
  <BR>
  Daddy sent me to the University of Georgia in hopes of me getting my "MRS." degree.  I believe HE chose that school for me because it wasn't too far from home.  Within hours he could reach me and remind me of my place in life, as his "obedient" daughter, Bryn.   Signing me up for classes, choosing my friends, and boyfriends, and denying the *undesirables* access to my life.  I only wished for him to have a litle faith in MY choices.  Praise God for good friends who understood that when Daddy was in town, they were to remain scarce, or face the wrath of my father.  ::Sigh::  Oh, don't get me wrong.. I love my Daddy, but he just has this way of thinking that he knows what is best for my life, and I do declare that it's just not true! ::Her voice hushes as in fear of someone hearing::  HE was the one that originally made the "match" between Junior Beauregard and myself.   ::Cringes at the sound of the name:: He was the most boring, unimaginative, self-centered, pretentious human being I have ever met.   The one thing he had going for him, his unbridled passion for his career,  was what ultimately led to Daddy's condemnation.  (Oh, how I wished he showed passion for someone... er.. something else.)  Junior had plans of his own and rejected Daddy's "generous" job offer with his company.     Needless to say, Junior was no longer acceptable in Daddy's eyes because he was uncontrollable. :::Suddenly her mind flashes on a picture of her sister Mist::  I would PRAY at night for the Lord to taketh this cup away from me :::giggling:: ...meaning Junior... and apparently He understood. ::smiling::  Since the honeymoon is paid for... my parents thought this would be an opportunity for me to "get away from it all" and find myself, ::chuckles:: or a rich count on the French Riviera.  ::Cautiously looks at door::  And that's where THEY think I'm going to be.  However, my friend Cecily was gracious enough to take the tickets and will be mailing Momma and Daddy best wishes from me from time to time.  But *I* have other plans.... ::She says with a twinkle in her eye::<BR>
  <BR>
  My sister, Mist left the household at the age of 18.  Naturally, Mist was cut off from the family fortune, and Daddy would KILL me if he knew I had kept in contact much less helped finance her way through college on my allowance.  One of the few things in my life I cherish as being "mine". The relationship between my sister and I.  ::Smiles sweetly:: I love her.  She is the one person who has never TOLD me what to do.. but asked me.  Between you and me.. I think something happened 11 years ago when Mist left...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#fefefe" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B> </FONT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#FFFFFF" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B>something that no one dares speak about... even Mist.. who wouldn't pass up dishing dirt on Daddy in a minute.  ::Reminiscing::  I remember, one night... when I was about to leave for college... I awoke to hear my momma crying..  She was talking to Daddy... and saying something about Mist... I arrived too late at their door to make it out clearly... between the tears... and then Daddy... he... :::Bryn shudders at the sound of the slap then shakes herself as if out of a deep dream::: Daddy... he ... must have been helping her out of a fit... Momma gets those.. from her drinking.. that must have been it :::She says in a soft whisper.. more to convince herself than anyone else:::  I need to find out what happened.  What broke my perfect family.  Now's my chance to confront her, without being under Daddy's "watchful" eye.<BR>
  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>:::Looks at letter again as if drawing strength and says with intensity:::  I have been in the "Monroe" stronghold for so long that I feel I have been totally unmarked and been unremarkable. It's time for me to experience life and put some color on this blank canvas of mine.  Voletta is somehow part of my Destiny... I feel it in my soul.  I'm being beckoned... and for the first time in my life... I'm going to take the road less traveled.. the road to the unknown.. and confront those demons head on.  Demons.. ::startled by her choice of words::: I wonder what made that come out of my mouth?<BR>
  <BR>
  :::The ANT smiles a sly grin:::<BR>

  ::She looks and says:: Well, do I pass?  Do I get to see my sister?  I've heard it's all up to you....<BR>
