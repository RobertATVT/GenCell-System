 They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a non-believer.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

His left leg, shattered in his final play in college, possess a very noticeable limp. His eyes are nothing but cold seas of blue set in his head, permanently analytical in their gaze.<BR>

  	Born on August sixteen he was the first of three children, and Marcus Hill devoted his life to making the all-mighty dollar. He had a plan in place, and was ready to execute it. He was going to play football, he was good at it after all. He played his way through high school, and into LSU. He gained the reputation of a tough, gritty back with speed and control. He was also damaged goods.<BR>
  <BR>
  	By the age of sixteen, Marcus had fallen to the world of violence and drugs that inhabit the projects. He made it abundantly clear that he enjoyed that world, and that hurt his chances of going to college. He drifted from interview to interview, school to school, not really caring what happened.<BR>
  <BR>
  	He ended up at LSU, and played his heart out to prove his doubters wrong. He lasted three years, and then, in what he thought would be his last game, disaster struck. He was running up the sideline with roughly five minutes remaining on the clock in an LSU rout. He planted his foot, just as a safety came in with a bone-crushing tackle. His football career was over.<BR>
  <BR>
  	Forced to walk, or rather limp, around the campus, he quickly sank into depression. He wandered the streets at night like a spector, and one night came upon a rather interesting display. It was a vampire, hard at work on a girl's throat.<BR>
  <BR>
  	He watched with a sense of morbid fascination as the vampire sucked the body dry. Instantly he felt a burning urge awake inside of him. He had to learn about them, not to kill them, but because they interested him. He was obsessed, and with his obsession came a new purpose. He immediately began to check out odd books at the library so he could learn all there was to know about vampires. Armed with his knowledge, he left Baton Rouge, and made his way to Voletta.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
