<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 Breed:  Mortal<BR>
 Age and/or birth date:  27<BR>
 Eye Color:  Naturally bluish-grey, but changes often via contact lenses.  Often changes them in the middle of a conversation by using slight-of-hand.<BR>
 Hair:  Black<BR>
 Height/weight:  6'0"<BR>
 Occupation:  Magician and Illusionist.  Known as "The Master Of Fire" as his act 			    usually revolves around controlling fire.<BR>
 Equipment/weapons:  A multitude of items used for various illusions are constantly hidden about his person.  Hidden pockets hold items for vanishing objects, floating objects, smoke pellets, etc.  Has several hidden dispensers of a special fire-producing compound which Mikhail created.  The compound has several variations, such as a paste for making himself and other objects in his hands burst into flame for any length of time without burning.  Forced to fight, he will usually try to intimidate the attacker by bursting into flame with claims of magical powers, or possibly disappearing in the famous puff-of-smoke.  If forced to fight, he has pellets containing a knock-out gas that explode on contact, pellets that produce a blinding flash when thrown, all well-concealed in secret compartments about his person. (These magician's skills will be reflected in Special Effects and Acting skills, as well as any pertinent weapons skills).<BR>
 Appearance (clothes, etc.):  A tall, striking figure, usually wears a black pin-  stripe suit and black trenchcoat.  Sharp, severe features, with jet-black hair long and combed back.  Speaks with a Russian accent.  Can be extremely charming when he wants to be, and equally fierce as well.  He never loses his temper when angered; rather, he seems to radiate an icy cool wrath which becomes readily apparent to those around him even though his expression does not change.  When he commands attention, people seem irresistibly compelled to pay that attention.<BR>

								<U>The Story of Mikhail<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></U>  <BR>
	The theater had been open for some time now, and the air was thick and dusky with smoke.  The upper class were packed in rows, evening wear with a careworn regalia.  Opera jackets and ermine coats, opulence stuffed with the patrons and the seats likewise stuffed, as Moscow poured it's patrons into the vast auditorium.<BR>
	The man who took the stage looked very old, but not in the frail way that most people usually look old.  His hair, though silver, looked chisled almost, as fixed as his severe, chiseled features.  His tuxedo did not looked poorly tailored, as fine clothes tend to do on men his age who had owned them much too long.  His clothing seemed as well, a part of him, as fixed as the odd, steely blue eyes which missed nothing.  He looked immovable, stoic, old like the Parthenon is old, or the pyramids are old.  To look at him, one got the impression that if he had wished to stand there, unmoved, for thousands of years, long after the theater had gone, through wind, rain, wars and plagues, then he would have had no trouble doing just that.<BR>
	There were no props on the stage, no magic boxes, or cages or velvet-covered tables.  He took the stage alone, yet immediately commanded it as surely as any sea captain commanded his ship, even before he had made a move or uttered a word.  A single, soft spotlight attempted to highlight his presence, but this was as futile as throwing water onto a pond.  Not a single eye in the theatre was not captured by his impressive visage.  Every attention now belonged to Kruschev, the great magician.<BR>
	To have heard his performance described in plain words, one might have thought that it was fairly simple.  But to actually see it, one would wonder if the old man had tapped into real magic, primal and elemental.  To have called what he did tricks would have been like saying that Michaelangelo had merely added some color to the ceiling of a church somewhere.  Cards danced about him like leaves one a gentle autumn breeze.  Objects vanished and appeared without so much as a flourish of the hand or the twitch of a muscle, floating from hand to hand and in and out of the ether with an ease that seemed as natural to the man as breathing.  The patrons all sat transfixed, not so much as a whisper or a cough between them throughout the performance.  Mouths were agape, almost as if his magic had reached beyond the confines of the stage and had enraptured them.  Including the small boy, crouched at the back in simple streetclothes, hoping that no one would see him.<BR>
							*			*			*<BR>
	The boy ran had home as he did every night, the wonders of the past hours racing through his mind as wildly as his feet raced across the streets.  Every night that the Great Kruschev performed, he snuck into the old theater between the other patrons to see the conjurer weave his magic upon the stage.  And every night he would run back to the orphanage and shimmy up the drainpipe to his room, hopefully before the matron discovered that he had been gone.  He dodged through the lamp-lit streets, the steam rising from the sewer-covers creating a sort of sporadic fog that punctuated his route.  He rounded the last corner into the alley by the orphanage, and ran smack into what felt like a wall.  He bounced backward and fell unceremoniously to the pavement, scraping his palms as his arms wheeled backward to stop his fall.  He took a moment to catch his breath, then stood up and dusted himself off.  He then looked up . . . at the imposing figure who stood in the darkness before him.<BR>
	<I>"It is far too late to be out in the streets of Moscow alone, young one."</I>  The voice was clean, cool and modulated with the perfection of one who had had a great deal of time to practice.  They were not simple words, but a declaration, etched in stone, of how things were.  The figure stepped forward into the light, revealing the face of Kruschev, as fixed and stonelike now as it had been in the theatre.  The boy staggered back, not in fear, but rather in awe of his idol now up close.  <I>"Likely your parents are worried about you."</I><BR>
	The child stood aghast, unsure of what to say.<BR>
	<I>"Surely you have parents, hmm?"<BR>
	"No, sir."<BR>
	</I>The old man looked around, as if confirming the fact by what he saw.  <I>"Yes.  Yes, I see.  So you live at the orphanage here?"<BR>
	"Yes, sir."<BR>
	"And you sneak away from those who watch you to come and see my show."<BR>
	</I>The child stopped, startled.  <I>"Y, Yes sir."</I><BR>
<I>	"What is your name, child?"<BR>
	"Mikhail, sir."<BR>
	"Mikhail, you may call me Mr. Kruschev.  Do you like living at the orphanage, Mikhail?"<BR>
	"No, sir."<BR>
	"Aha, very honest, yes.  Mikhail, how would you like to come live with me, and learn to do magic, like I do?"<BR>
	</I>Mikhail stopped to consider the sheer enormity of the question.  It was as if he had been asked if he would like to inherit the world.<BR>
	<I>". . . yes, Mr. Kruschev."<BR>
	"Ah, good.  Now, you take this money and this piece of paper.  There is a cabman around the corner, and you give him this money, and tell the man to take you to the place written on this paper.  I will arrange matters with Miss Doyevski at the orphanage, and will meet you there.  Do you understand?"<BR>
	". . .Yes, Mr. Krushchev."<BR>
	"Good, as I thought you would.  Now run along, young Mikhail."<BR>
	"Yes, sir."<BR>
<BR>

								       <U>Twelve Years Later</U><BR>
<BR>
	Mikhail stood at the center of the market square, and cards danced.  Those who passed by gravitated towards the area, as if drawn inexorably by some strange force.  Over that small area, it seemed as if Mikhail had taken temporary posession, over the cobbles and all the pedestrians.  He had taken to Mr. Kruschev's teachings like a second nature.  But the formality had long since dropped.  He now called Mr. Kruschev Grandfather, and Kruschev knew Mikhail as his beloved Grandson.  They had found in each other the families that each had never known.<BR>
	The street performance finished, much to the dismay of the onlookers, and Mikhail took up his hat, now brimming with loose money, and headed for home.  <BR>
He got halfway, and suddenly broke into the pell-mell run that he had known so well in his youth.  He bounded between alleyways and sidestreets, taking the quickest route home that he knew, and burst through the door.<BR>
	"Grandfather, grandfather!  I am home!"<BR>
	</I>Strangely, no answer came but the wind beating outside.<BR>
	<I>"Grandfather, where are you?"</I><BR>
	He began to walk from room to room, still to no reply.  He approached Grandfather's bedroom . . . tenatively.  For some reason that he never explained, the bedroom always remained locked,  and it was the only room in the house the Mikhail was forbidden to enter.  He gently pushed open the door.<BR>
	<I>"Grandfather?"<BR>
</I>	The room was in dissaray, as if a struggle had taken place.  The room was sparse, with no windows.  What little items there were were strewn about the room, many broken, and here and there was a touch of blood.  But strangest of all was the pile of . . . dust?. . . in the center of the room.  He walked closer, terrified for the first time that he could ever remember.  He could see now that it was not dust.  But ashes.  All ashes, save for Grandfather's pocket watch, bent, twisted, and charred.<BR>
							*			*			*<BR>

<BR>
<I>	I sit here, alone, on the plane to America, and I do not know what to expect.  With Grandfather gone, there is nothing left for me in Moscow.  The police came, but soon gave up as there was nothing, not even a corpse.  I wondered what to do for so long, with no purpose.  And then I found his journal.  Much of the writing is undecipherable to me, but this place . . . it is mentioned many times.  A town in America, where I might finally find the answers that I seek.  It is called Isle Voletta . . .</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
