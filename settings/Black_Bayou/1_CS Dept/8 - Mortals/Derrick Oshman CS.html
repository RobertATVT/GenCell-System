</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
Luck<I> </I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Gift</B> - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  To some, nature bestows special gifts.  These people have the unique ability of using both hands equally well.  The character may take 2 attacks per round, one with each hand.  These attacks are limited to small bladed, small arms, non-lethal attacks and hand-to-hand fighting, as the rest of the skills tend to require the use of two hands.  The attack made with the regular hand is rolled normally and the attack made with the second hand is made with -4 to attack.  The defender is allowed to dodge normally, taking a -2 penalty for each attack after the first for the round.  i.e. If DavisMason is dodging this mortal as his first dodge for the round, he dodges the first attack normally.  The dodge for the second attack is at -2.  Each dodge after that suffers a -2 penalty as normal.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Background: </B>Derrick Oshman, adopted at the age of four by a loving Caucasian family in the Greater New Orleans area. Derrick was raised with his two sisters, youngest an asian orphan, the eldest the couples natural born daughter. Derrick through early childhood to his later teen years lead a very normal life in and out of schooling. He had been attending LSU Baton Rouge until events deterred him. Life did not get intresting for Derrick until he placed his birth place to a sparse localization of Oshawaw Tribe Indians, somewhere along the plains of Colorado. (Tribe is fictional for freedom of RP.) Gathering what little knowledge he could from the now depleted, near nonexistent tribe, through extensive research and funding from a supportive family, he began combining this new found knowledge of herbs and mystical healing with his education of current medicine. Combining the two-forms of medicine has allowed Derrick an interesting life the last two years. His practices were noticed by family friends who happened to be among social elite. Allowing Derrick new experiences he never dreamed possible, also giving him an affinity if not obsession for the Asian culture in which most of his time has been focused in for new practices to increase his repertoire. Upon his increasing uses for medical treatment a social "friend" he had been treating for an aledged lycanthropic disease mentioned strange happenings in a town somwhere near his hometown of New Orleans. Social circle soon to find new means of treatment, as fads often come and go, he travels back towards his home, to Isle Voletta, hoping that at least the mysterious association with voodoo could be useful with more research if not his reputation.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
