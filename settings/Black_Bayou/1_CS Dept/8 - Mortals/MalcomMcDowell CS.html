 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Born in Ireland to the loving parents of Catholics he found  himself somewhat at a cross road.  While growing up he heard various  arguments for and against the Catholic Church and likewise for the Protestant.  He decided early on then that no religon was ever right and that one should never really follow any religous teachings for religon only leads to violence.  He went through grade school and middle school while in Ireland and then when he was about 15 his parents decided it was time to move on over to the U.S. for some better education opertunities, and for a better life then the one  Malcom had at that point.  They moved over to the States then where Malcom finished his education.  After finishing his education he found himself interested in the ancient myths of old, of the greeks and the Toltecs.  It was an interesting session at how they were.  He soon got his Major in Demonology, and his minor in Werewolf paranormal studies of the Northern American Continent.  After leaving college around the tender age of 25, he  began writing a few books.  He wrote of how the greeks when describing their gods had been describing actually Demons masquerading as Gods.  That the demons were just of lesser order.  Such as Aphrodite is just the Demon of  Lust where as Ares would be the Demon of Anger.  He wrote those books in  about 2 years, and soon was invited to make a few lectures at some well known colleges.  He did the college lecture thing for about another two years  before being asked to Teach at one of the colleges.  He was honored to do so and so began teaching in his Major, Demonology.  He taught for about 6 years before deciding it was time to move on and explore the world a bit more, see what he could learn else where.  After hearing of a place that was supposedly "Spook" central he headed on down there deciding to see what could happen and what he could learn down there.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
