Unemployed, but a kind of a Jack-of-all-Trades type.  What's working to those of us who're just looking for a good time?  Screw the American Dream.  There's time for that later.  Though there was that little bit of money from Grandpa that's quietly earning interest.  A drifter doesn't have many expenses anyway.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  2d6+Will vs. 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate. <BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Some mortals seem to be blessed with a natural affinity toward animals.  With the use of this mastery, a mortal can calm an animal and befriend him for a time, be it wild or tame.  Simple, one word verbal commands given to the animal will be understood.  The duration can be extended with the expenditure of extra soul, no re-roll is necessary.  Shepherd's Aura has the potential to affect a breed while it is in an animal form, including Horus.  In any case, if the roll is against a player character, then the roll is vs the targets 2d6+Will.  These feelings tend to carry over to the mortal form and are viewed as "good vibes."<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Background:  Sanity Carter was born to a family of 7 other children.  Her father and mother worked a ranch in Dallas, Texas until a disease killed half the cattle.  The financial and emotional strain sent her mother packing.  3 of the children followed, Sanity stayed behind to wrangle the other siblings, strangely living up to her name by being the voice of reason in the crisis.  As her father slipped deeper into a steady depression, she worked to get her remaining brother and sisters off to college.  As soon as they were gone, she set off down the road to maker her fortune.<BR>
	Sadly, as many find out, the life of a traveler is a lonely one.  Sanity spends most of her time seeing the world and seeking out parties and friends.  She knows someone in every town, and makes it a point to think of herself as a sort of missionary--floating on the tides of fate to do the good work of the Powers That Be.  <BR>
	On her way to New Orleans from the St. Patty's Day celebration in Savannah, GA, she was dropped off by a trucker who'd become tired of her endless chatter.  Faced with the Voletta Bar for the first time, Sanity quickly realized the bleak tendancies of the town, and through one bad turn after another, has decided maybe she's supposed to stay for awhile.  <BR>
