Who doesn't trust their 'tender?  An icon from 80s television and classic movies, the bartender has become someone we believe in, someone we confide in...well, let's face it, someone we spill our guts to.  And someone we've trusted when they stood in front of us, pouring drinks as we made scandalous deals with dark figures.  What do they know?  What could they bring down on us if they just bothered to find reason?<BR>

<B>Description:</B> The ability to compose and play music is not the easiest form of employment, but can certainly be satisfying to the individual.  The music skill itself is a rather broad skill, but musicians the world over have learned multitudes of instruments and most can play more than one.  In other words, if you own the Musician Occupation you do not have a limit on your instrument choice.  If you do not have this Occupation, you must choose one style of musical talent to strive for - writer or musician.  In parenthesis next to your Music Skill, list which type of music talent you are as well as what instrument you use, or the word 'writer'.  Success of a writing roll allows the character to write a musical piece that others enjoy and want to listen to.  Successfully making a play roll represents the characters ability to perform a musical composition well by utilizing voice or more mechanical instrument, not making mistakes, and generally impressing those who listen.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some mortals have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Twenty-two years ago, Harriet and Michael Cendrice had a second child.  Well, Harriet had the child, if you want to be precise, but anyway.  They lived in a small suburb, just outside of L.A., a fairly average family.  Not perfect, but normal, if you can define normal.  But their second kid was extraordinarily beautiful, and didn't even take after them.  They all had black hair, with blue eyes and fairly pale skin.  Kinda weird people.  Welsh.<BR>
<BR>
Their daughters, Rachel and Cara, were as different as night and day.  Rachel was withdrawn, moody, prone to depression, and rebellious.. She was fairly average in looks, too.  A whiny chick with a guitar.  But Cara.. Cara was outgoing, friendly, beautiful, and she played the flute in band.  <BR>
<BR>
Yes, Rachel hated Cara.<BR>
<BR>
Mostly because of looks, though.  Rachel wanted *so* much to be extraordinary.  Special.  She was special, because she had an amazing flair for poetry, but that's something else.  She also hated their parents, because, while they certainly gave Rachel an adequate amount of love and care, she *knew* she could never amount to what Cara was.  Their golden daughter.  I'm not trying to say that they favored Cara, but it was difficult to praise them equally because Cara did so much more to be praised for.<BR>
<BR>
December 25.  1993.  Rachel shot herself through the mouth.  Cara was heartbroken.  She really loved her sister, she did, and she knew it was because of her.  Her parents were sad, but they tried not to show it, not wanting to worry Cara.<BR>
<BR>
Cara's grades dropped dramatically, she became depressed and withdrawn.  She stopped eating.  Her looks were beginning to disappear.  Mrs. Cendrice was trying to help her by getting her internet.  Bad idea.  She was on it constantly.<BR>
<BR>
Then Cara just took off.  Left.  Seventeenth birthday.  She became a waitress in Wisconsin, at some diner.  Earned a living.  Got fired.  But, she was perky again, happy and nice and innocent and all that stuff.  So she decided to make a new beginning.<BR>
<BR>
Here she is, folks, ready or not.  Cara is Isle Voletta's new burst of sunshine.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
