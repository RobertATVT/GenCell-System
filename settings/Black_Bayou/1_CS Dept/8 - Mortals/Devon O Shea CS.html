<B>Advantage:</B>   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<BR>
 Background:   Devon O'Shea was born in Dublin Ireland on Valentine's Day 1974, the youngest of a set of twins his sister Sarah having been born 6 minutes prior to him.  Devon and his family left Ireland in 1980 when his father's job was relocated to Aspen, Colorado.  Devon grew into a talented athlete spending most of his youth skiing and playing various sports, but Soccer was were Devon's abilities truly shined.  From the time he was 12 he spent his summers playing for various all star teams.  While Devon used sports to make friends and become quite popular, Sarah was more withdrawn preferring to stay in the shadows and let Devon take the spotlight.  As different as they seemed however Devon and Sarah remained very close.  Sarah in fact helped Devon thru many a teen age crisis from dating to school.<BR>
<BR>
	Coming out of high school, Devon was recruited by most major colleges for his soccer abilities.  However he shocked many people when he turned down many more attractive offers to except a scholarship to Colorado St. and attend college with his sister.  Devon success on the soccer pitch continued thru college, and thanks to Sarah he managed to handle the academic requirements as well. While Devon fame soared in athletics, Sarah made her mark as an Academic. As there junior year ended both Devon and Sarah's future seemed bright.  Devon was looking forward to graduating then Joining  M.L.S. fora career in professional soccer and maybe even a chance to play for the United States national team.  Meanwhile Sarah was looking forward to student teaching in her senior year and then going on to a teaching career. Funny how fate changes the course of ones future.<BR>
<BR>
	Sarah had an immense love of children and often baby-sat for neighborhood children.  While returning home from baby sitting one night Sarah never returned home.  Her family was immediately concerned.  Sarah was never one to not call ahead and say she would be coming home late.  There worst fears came thru when Sarah's mutilated body was found in a Denver dumpsite.  The day Sarah was buried, Devon buried his dreams of a career in professional soccer. The Police had no luck in finding Sarah's murderer. Returning to school Devon played a final season of collegiate soccer leading Colorado St. to an N. C. A. A.  title, Devon also pushed himself in the classroom to raise his grades.  Upon graduation Devon turned down an opportunity to play in the M. L. S.  and entered the Colorado State Police Academy where he graduated first in his class.  Devon would devote his life to protecting innocents and to finding his sisters murderer.  He would accomplish the latter when he least expected it.  After graduating from the Academy Devon was assigned to the Colorado St. Police as a Lieutenant.  One rainy night on a routine traffic stop, Devon noticed a something leaking from the trunk of the car.  Having the driver open the trunk revealed the body of a badly maimed young woman. The driver was immediately taken into custody and a search of the trunk revealed numerous wallets and purses, one belonging to Sarah O'Shea.  When Devon asked the man if he had killed all the women who's wallets were found he smiled and answered yes.  Devon held a Sarah's drivers license and asked the man if he remembered the woman.  The man nodded and laughed telling him of how she had begged for him to let her go to her family and prayed to the lord to save her.  The monster smiled and told Devon she was the one he enjoyed killing most.  Devon snapped, beating the man until his partner pulled him off.  Devon shook off his partner and drew his revolver intending to kill the man, seeing this the murdered urged Devon to do it and send him to hell where he wanted to be.           <BR>
<BR>
	 As Devon prepared to fire, he thought of Sarah, this was not what she would have wanted, Sarah would want this man tried so all the families of his Victims could see justice done.  Dropping the gun Devon collapsed sobbing to the cold wet ground.  Devon received an accommodation for capturing the "Boulder Butcher" but he could not go on living in Colorado, so he went to the library and searched for Police Departments that were looking for officers.  One name stood out to him the Isle Voletta police department in Louisiana.  Giving his 2 week notice Devon left behind his life in Colorado and headed to Isle Voletta<BR>

	Sarah had an immense love of children and often baby-sat for neighborhood children.  While returning home from baby sitting one night Sarah never returned home.  Her family was immediately concerned.  Sarah was never one to not call ahead and say she would be coming home late.  There worst fears came thru when Sarah's mutilated body was found in a Denver dumpsite.  The day Sarah was buried, Devon buried his dreams of a career in professional soccer. The Police had no luck in finding Sarah's murderer. Returning to school Devon played a final season of collegiate soccer leading Colorado St. to an N. C. A. A.  title, Devon also pushed himself in the classroom to raise his grades.  Upon graduation Devon turned down an opportunity to play in the M. L. S.  and entered the Colorado State Police Academy where he graduated first in his class.  Devon would devote his life to protecting innocents and to finding his sisters murderer.  He would accomplish the latter when he least expected it.  After graduating from the Academy Devon was assigned to the Colorado St. Police as a Lieutenant.  One rainy night on a routine traffic stop, Devon noticed a something leaking from the trunk of the car.  Having the driver open the trunk revealed the body of a badly maimed young woman. The driver was immediately taken into custody and a search of the trunk revealed numerous wallets and purses, one belonging to Sarah O'Shea.  When Devon asked the man if he had killed all the women who's wallets were found he smiled and answered yes.  Devon held a Sarah's drivers license and asked the man if he remembered the woman.  The man nodded and laughed telling him of how she had begged for him to let her go to her family and prayed to the lord to save her.  The monster smiled and told Devon she was the one he enjoyed killing most.  Devon snapped, beating the man until his partner pulled him off.  Devon shook off his partner and drew his revolver intending to kill the man, seeing this the murdered urged Devon to do it and send him to hell where he wanted to be.           <BR>

	 As Devon prepared to fire, he thought of Sarah, this was not what she would have wanted, Sarah would want this man tried so all the families of his Victims could see justice done.  Dropping the gun Devon collapsed sobbing to the cold wet ground.  Devon received an accommodation for capturing the "Boulder Butcher" but he could not go on living in Colorado, so he went to the library and searched for Police Departments that were looking for officers.  One name stood out to him the Isle Voletta police department in Louisiana.  Giving his 2 week notice Devon left behind his life in Colorado and headed to Isle Voletta<BR>
