 These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

 <B>Advantage:</B>  Although often eccentric and seem to do things apparently strange to us as they create, authors have that special gift that turns creativity into works of art.  Therefore, authors gain +3 to any Writing rolls they attempt.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
 <B><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human soul is known to manifest itself during desperate times of need.  During times of intense fear or when faith is the only thing they have left, mortals tend to reach deep down into places they didn't even know existed and harnessing this energy from everything that makes them mortal.  As a result, the player may add +8 to the next Faith roll their character makes (only applies when a the Faith skill is used).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  Anyway, Amy has two sisters. Mysterinam and Sursa. She is the youngest. Myst and Sursa became vampires one night after a wild party, and left home. Amy only remembers mom and dad cring a lot and a few nights where Sursa would visit her and tell her it would be okay. Mom and Dad said Myst went out on her own and that Sursa was living with Gma. Amy accepted that for what it was and kept to her books. Her mother taught her to be rational,intelligent, and Christian... whiler her father~the Amurana~ tried to tell her about what that name meant for her. Amy took her mothers side and felt her father had a screw loose. they moved to Hawaii and she stuck to studies and church. Her mother passed on and her father dissapeared. Luckily she was able to live on her own. Everything went normal enough, a bit lonely. During her junior year she got a distress call from her younger cousin Sara to come and help control Sursa. She was told her sister was a vampire, but refused to believe. Next thing she knew she was knocked up and her sister was threatening her life. Turns out Sursa ran off to new york, stole sperm, drugged her, and now wants the baby. Amy miscarried and was almost killed when Sursa lost her mind.... but luckily Myst Sara and Gma came to her rescue. She hasnt seen any of them since that night. she imediately came home and packed for Hawaii. since then she graduated with honors. She met a nice guy while signing up for college classes. A native Hawaiian with the same interests. They bonded over literature and myths. She taught him some things about her religion, and he taught her some things about wrestling. Funny trade, but it worked. One night Amy confessed about the entire Isle Voletta experience. He proceded to talk her into coming back so she can find out more about what was going on in the city. he wanted to know almost as bad as she did if the things said about vampires and other creatures were true. "You believes in angels, whats so different?" he asked. So with strained goodbyes she returned to Amurana Estate. Sara was shocked to see her. She caught Amy up pretty easy. Sursa was sane again and had come back only to get a few things, including Lava... Sursas tiger. It was just Sara and Prozac in the house now. Prozac being a large fluffy orange cat. Sara's kept a neat and convienient job at a local wiccan shop selling pendulums, candles, and other such things. She said they were hiring, but Amy wants to find something more to do with books. She also cant wait to find a church she can attend, but when she asked Sara she got laughter at first, then a stone face telling Amy not to bother in this town. It's like a death wish. So here she is. Someone who feels like God has a purpose for her existance, but is too shy to venture away from reading poems and novels long enough to do anything but eat. She has no clue what Isle Voletta has in store...<BR>
