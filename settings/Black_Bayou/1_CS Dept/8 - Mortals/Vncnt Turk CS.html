Due to your Soul stat being only at level 5, your Faith skill cannot exceed that, even with teh addition of the gift.  You lose one level there.  Other than that, good to go.<BR>

They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Vincent Turk grew up Vincent Vincini in New York's Hell's Kitchen, having the typically rough childhood of all those who grew up there.  He grew up a juvenille delinquent, in and out of institutions from the time he was 12.  Things changed, however, when his older brother, Anthony, joined a gang, the Red Masquers.  Not just a typical gang, but a gang of vampires, known for their love of shoot-ups, fearless because of their quick healing powers and superior strength.  New initiates into the gang weren't told it's true nature at first, not until they had proven themselves.  When Anthony found out, he tried to leave the gang.  But he knew too much.  He was found two weeks later.<BR>
    Sick of the violence and chaos that had brought his brother's end, Vincent grew up to join the NYPD.  He immediately hunted down the Masquers, and then, in a raid on their hideout, he discovered their true nature.  He was nearly killed in that raid, in fact the only survivor.  He began to study vampire lore intensely, garnering all the information he could.  Searching through countless police records, poring through every library in New York City, he slowly learned the ways of the enemy.  He eventually took down the Red Masquers, and his work called the attention of a confidential branch of the CIA.<BR>
    That secret branch had been created to study paranormal activities in the US.  They hired him, and for the next several years he worked on countless paranormal cases, building information on, and fighting, the enemies the government would not officially acknowledge, but could not ignore.  Then, accidentally, he discovered some information that even he was not supposed to see.  A conspiracy, a silent influence of the vampires that reached high into the government offices.  He was sent on a dummy assignment, and disavowed, all records of his existence erased.  He was not, however, without skills to forge a new identity.  He created a new fabricated history, and took the name Vincent Turk.  He now fights the same enemies he has for years, on the sly.  His methodical, slow but sure, stealthy and surreptitious.  He moves to an area, builds a rapport, lies in wait, and assassinates the enemy one by one.  He works various jobs in different cities, sometimes as a policeman or a private investigator.  He has built contacts all over the nation, and through them he has just uncovered the location of an intense concentration of the predatoric enemies.  It is called Isle Voletta, and he heads there now...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
