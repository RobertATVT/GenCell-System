<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B> Background:</B>  Andre Jamison was born in Atlanta, Georgia on the third day of April, 1980.  He was the second of five children in the household.  His father was a hard-working man, but nevertheless, his job did little to help him support his family.  They were forced to live in the projects (and sometimes on the streets) for as long as Andre could remember.  Andre did average throughout school (participating on the high school basketball team in the earlier years of high school), rarely making any failing grades until he hit the last years of high school.  Those were the years when his company and attitude seemed to change.  He was no longer the sweet, innocent, little Andre Jamison that his mother knew him to be.  He had hit a streak of rebellion, and started running the streets, eventually joining a gang.  Life was easier on Andre when he was just into the gang scene; he had running money, and even a little money to help his mom and dad with the bills.  Never could he know the dangers he would inevitably face on down the road.  He graduated high school barely, passing the last of his classes in summer school.  <BR>
After graduating high school, Andre got into drugs.  At first it was just simple experimentation, but with that, on came the ongoing process.  His preference to marijuana soon had his friends calling him 'Puff'.<BR>
Following a long night of alcohol and drug abuse, Puff and a couple of his gang friends started for their homes in the projects.  One stop sign found them right amidst the 'bad section' of the outskirts of a nearby town.  There, an older black male walked up to the driver's open car window, asking for some spare change.  The driver, Andre's best friend, Jerome Edwards, drunkenly shoved the old man's hands away.  The man then pulled a handgun, threatening to shoot them all if they didn't get out of the car and give him all their money.  Calmly, the three boys got out of the car.  Jerome (of a fair standing in the gang in which they were affiliated) looked to Andre for a second, and Puff knew that he didn't plan to give up anything.  When the man's attention was turned to the third member of their group, Kendrick Edwards (Jerome's younger brother), they made their move, Andre taking the man's gun arm out and Jerome quickly pulling a knife and burying it deep in the man's back.  The three boys quickly hopped back into Jerome's car and sped away, each of them scared out of their wits at what might happen.  Even Jerome, in his several years of gang affiliation, had never killed a person.<BR>
A couple of days later, the three planned to leave town, and probably even the state, for fear that they might get caught and punished for the murder.  Getting all their belongings together, they soon set out on a road trip, having no idea of their destination.  They rode long distances without getting any sleep, and even when their eyes felt as if weighed down by bricks, they grudgingly stopped at a hotel.  <BR>
Their destination was finally appointed to be southern California.  With Jerome's terrible sense of direction, and Kendrick's terrible map reading skills, they seemed to drift off the planned route (even moreso than could be expected).  Another long night of riding they had endured, Jerome at the wheel (sometimes allowing Andre to drive so he could rest up some), while the youngest of the group, Kendrick, was stuck to the map reading.<BR>
All three of them feeling as if they wouldn't be able to stay awake another minute, and even more happy they were at the end of the bridge they had been crossing, Andre pulled into a parking lot of a run-down hotel.  Where were they anyway?  Too sleepy to either ask or care, they made their way to the rooms they had rented.  The rooms themselves were extremely uncomfortable, each holding only two rock-hard beds.  The decorations were scarce, as were the feelings of welcome.  The boys shrugged it off, though, figuring that they would soon be out of the area.  Jerome and Kendrick soon dropped onto their respective beds, Andre doing likewise in the next room.<BR>
Morning came soon for Andre.  Stepping out of bed and stretching all the kinks out of his muscles, he got dressed go go into the next room and wake the other two.  As he stepped outside his door, he noticed that the door of the room in which Jerome and Kendrick were staying was slightly ajar.  Thinking that they must already be bustling about (probably getting ready to leave the raunchy hotel) and that they just forgot to close the door, he knocked on the door, stepping into an empty room.  It was as if no one had stayed in the room the night before.  Again passing it off, thinking that they had just packed and gone for an early breakfast, he made his way toward the parking area.  There sat Jerome's car, empty and untouched since they left it last.  Now getting somewhat concerned with the whereabouts of his friends, he entered into the office and inquire there.<BR>
...Nobody had seen them since they signed in...<BR>
After a few more hours of endless searching, Andre came up with no clues as to where Jerome and Kendrick may have gone.  He still had the keys to Jerome's car in his pocket; perhaps someone in the nearest town would know where the two could have strayed off to.  <BR>
He thought himself in good fortune (although he was laughed at by some) as he found out that the nearest town (nearest town, he thinks; more populated area, he means) wasn't too far away.  Somehow having backtracked and headed back in, he comes upon the sign, which he reads aloud "</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><I>Isle</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I> Voletta, Louisiana?"</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
