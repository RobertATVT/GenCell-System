 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Ryu Hotoro, twenty-five years old, born on October 13, 1974, on a Friday. He was orphaned at the age of five. Ryu lived in Enzan, Japan since he was five, or at least he could remember. He only remembers something's about his family. He had a mother, a father, and even a little sister. In his dreams he remembers a day deep in the forest where he use to live. It was a bright day, then it turned black. Blood splattered across his face. Turning his head, he could see the silhouettes of men killing his family. Slitting his father's throat, raping and killing his mother. He couldn't find his sister, maybe they took her. He hide behind some trees, crying and wishing the bad men went away. The struggle stopped, and he peered around the tree's trunk. He found his mother and father slain on the green grass. His mother the only one left with any breath in her body, looked at her son and told him, "Find...your sister...Lina..." With that her head fell back, her eyes wide open. Ryu clasps her hands and feels something inside of it. A locket... Inside the locket was a picture of his family. He held onto the locket for his mother's sake. "Is this all a dream?" Come back into reality! All that he dreamt was real. <BR>
 <BR>
 	Years passed, and now one has reported the missing Hotoro family. No one knows of the wandering Ryu. Ryu managed to get by, do odd jobs and other types of employment. One particularly in a martial arts dojo. Ryu had no real training, and needed an edge to punish those who took his sister. He hated guns, and didn't care much for any other type of weapon. But the human body was the perfect weapon.  So, he taught himself various types of martial arts on his search, and has proven to have beaten many black belt masters. He learned English from his mother before she die. Very intellectual person, shy, and always quiet. He has not met an opponent he could not handle.<BR>
 <BR>
 	Twenty-five years of age, this Japanese young man is still searching for his sister in the US Still no sign of her. He can't bear to sleep sometimes, the visions ever so horrid and gothic. Ryu gets a lead on his sister's whereabouts where lead him to Voletta, LO. He wanders into Voletta, Louisiana wondering if he can find a job and his sister. Will he find his sister, if she's still alive...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
