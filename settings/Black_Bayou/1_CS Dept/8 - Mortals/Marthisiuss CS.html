They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

						</B>A long black curtain covered the windows as I looked around the aarea. I couldn't really see much, I was basically in the dark. Pain wrapped it's self around my rips as I glared to my right. I could feel the blood crawl from my side, there was a long burning from my cut. "Now Mahthisiuss, Ah'd Like to know where the ahchives are.." The male voice was low and cold.. I looked in the direction of where it came from.<BR>
<BR>
	There he stood, dressed in a white suit, I could see not much through the darkness. The man was like a brittish shadow, standing at what looked like 6'1". A click large click was made, it was deep and alone. There was only one other sound, the sound of a dripping water. A sharp pain entered my back. "Ugh.." The words were low from my mouth, they were pain filled. My tongue moved around my dry mouth, bloody saliva fell from my mouth down to my chest. I was stripped naked, hanging from two poles. <BR>
<BR>
	"Wha-What do you wan't fr-from me...?" I glanced around through the darkness. BEEEZZZP The long sound lasted for a good 5 seconds and a light was turned on. THe darkness was destroyed from the bright light. My eyes looked up to it, they slowly began to adjust to it. At first I had to fight from looking away, but it changed. "You see Garhelm, I want those archives. The thousands of years about my kind are documented, if they ever got out." He took a long pause, there was no emotion in his words, he continued,"It could be the very end of my race...Now tell me where they are!" Rage filled his low voice as a burning entered my leg. I Had felt as if I was on fire now...<BR>
<BR>
	The chains closed against my wrists causing a long warm thick liquid to fall down my arms. "S--Sorr-Sorry..You can't have the archives..." I smiled up to the man now. He formed a smile, his fangs were into view. "<tos>'nother vamp" I thought to myself, he approached me. He looked down to me, as if he was god-like. His eyes met mine. I had read they could control you by establishing eye contact. I laughed a bit and looked away. Laughing always helped my pain leave me. <BR>
<BR>
	"No Way, vampire scum" My stron words slipped out of my mouth to him. He laughed a bit "I don't think you're in any position to say no, child..I could suck you drink right now!" He yelled in my face. I needed to get  him to fight me..something to make him break my chains.  I lpooked to him, my weak blood shot eyes set to a stare. He kneeled down, looking to me. My saliva was projected out my mouth and towards his face. It went all over his face and fell to his suit. I felt a large bust in my nose, bloiod covered my vision now, I fell to the ground. The cool stone floor covered my body, I stood up now..<BR>
<BR>
	He ran towards me, it was time for my only hope. I pointed my cross to him and began to force energy into it. I felt as if I was in control now, he fell down. My foot pushed into his stomach, it moved into it now. Blood was all over my foot. I jumped backwards, his blood dragged against the stone floor. His hands coiled around his chest, like large snackes, clutching in pain. I took his gun and began shooting him, the bullets entered his head, I laughed a bit and walked out..<BR>
<BR>
	I had gotten away, but what drove me to this? I thought back to how it all started...MY name is Marthisiuss Garhelm, a vampire hunter. I know what I've seen, I have a hate for them..I will make sure they pay for the acts that they comitted.<BR>
<BR>
	The Garhelm family has been on this earth of many..many years. There has been tales told of our hate. When I was born they took me into training. I learned alot, But I was told to never make this my full occupation, they said that I should have something and my hunter side would be secret..<BR>
<BR>
	They started to hunt because of many things...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>We hunt them due to what they did to us. At a point in time, the days of knights there was Mavinvous Garhelm..He was at his age or 22 when it happend. He fell in love with a woman named Villia Giovanni..She was from Italy and had moved to Germany. Mavinvous had fallen in love with her. It was a classic lover story..The Giovanni's didn't like the Garhelms which caused a war of sorts. They mudered Mavinvous infront of the famly and then attacked the rest. This began a war.<BR>
<BR>
	The war was bettween us, and vampires. We wanted to eradicate every single last one of them off the face or the earth and that is what we would do. Generations through generations have been trained to fight them, we will continue to fight them till they are gone.<BR>
<BR>
	But see, this is not the end of our hate. About 50 years later, we the Garhelms were at our peak. We don't only hunt you know. You see we are given wealth by various items of business. Most of which are shipping. Back in those days, shipping was good. You see, You should never ever trust a vampire. They'll stab you in the back <g>. Walter Garhelm learned this the hard way. You see, he needed a partner. It seems that vampires happen to be rich! One of them had become Walter's partner...<BR>
<BR>
	Everything started out great. THey got along, Walter didn't even know the man was a vampire. Walter was married to a woman named, Elizabeth, he loved her with all his heart but Edwin (the vampire partner) wanted power. I guess vampires only want power and money. He used is powers upon Elizabeth and made her fall in, intense love with him. Walter found out this amn was a vampire, the battle began. HE gave his life up, trying to kill him. They all died...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
	Right when I was born my parents took me into training. I learned about vampires from all my family. They told me ways to cause pain. Ways to hurt them alot. I learned every thing from them...<BR>
<BR>
	When I was 14, I was shipped of to a boys school. There I learned many languages, I saw them there...I saw vampires walk through the nights on the school grounds. No one believed me, but I didn't care. I know what I saw, no matter what. The only person who did believe me was my mentor. You see the real reason I was sent there was to learn from my mentor. He taught me to use swords, and to power items and make vampires be filled with fear. I learned to use swords also. He told me many things, he said a war was comming. A war of vampres and mortals. He said they're terror would end, we would either live in peace, or they will all be destroyed...<BR>
<BR>
	I never liked vampires myself. They got on my nerves, I've seen them hunt many times, it always got my mad. They'd kill the person. I bet they thought they were god like..I never liked their skin either, I wanted to hit them every time I saw it..It was so pale..The fangs. Those ugly long giant fangs, I'd like to have them pulled from the blood suckers mouths and crush them with in my fists.<BR>
<BR>
	One day I went to visit my mentor, he was a professor at the school...I saw his body all over the room. It was mutilated. Thetre was no blood, I searched the body to find to holes on his neck. Vampires did it, they would pay. From that day forward I hated them.  used to act like they hunted them..I guess I became obsessed with vampires after that...<BR>
<BR>
	I went to Oxford for 4 years. There I learned about math, and business.. I also learned about  mythology. I felt alone at the school, but it was a family thing. We all had to attend Oxford. I got an interest in genetics, I focused my studies one them for the fact I thought I could destroy a vampire by messing with their genes..<BR>
<BR>
	I left the school, in persuit of an occupation that would help me. Something that might give me some acsess about vampires. I joined up with the FBI. This could help me get accsess with special cases. Such as murder ones, most vampires were clean but some weren't. I grew to be fond of the job. I met great people, did great things. We were given an assignement about a local terrorist ring. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Setting: El Paso, Tx<BR>
					</B>We stormed in from every side of the compound. The building was probably really old, it looked like a mexican mission. The white stone walls surrounded us. "GOLD GOLD!! GET OVER HERE NOW! THEY'RE KILLING US!!!" there  were many gun shots in the background, screams of pain and agony also. We moved to their location. <BR>
<BR>
	Blood covered the walls. Organs were all over the room, my eyes locked on Eddy. He fewll to the floor, vomit fell out of his mouth and moved across the floor. Like a wave of orange and green."Hey..It'll be okay.." My words were calm, I tried to calm him down. I moved looking for the killers who did this. There was a distant screaming in the next room. My legs moved slowly and stealthly. I was like a panther, dressed in black, looking for my prey. This time the prey would me the people who did this..The animals. <BR>
<BR>
	My lock picking kit was pulled out of a small sack from my belt. I began to fiddle with it and the locked door. THe screams grew louder and louder by the second. I needed to open the door! My patience began to fade as I kicked the door and jumped in. "FREEZE!!!" I yelled and pointed my gun at them. The glock was held tightly, I locked onto them. They turned around, blood was dripping from their mouthes. Laughter filled the room. It echoed against the bloody walls.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! </B>I shot the first one, the bullets shattered against his chest. The red mist covered my vision. Their fangs came down, they glared to me. I could feel the rage filled thoughts. They were probably mad about their falled comrad. They jumped forward, the first one's fist entered my chest. I kicked forward, wanting him to die. <B>BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! </B>Another fell to the ground. I ripped through the dead flesh, I wanted to kill every one of them..<BR>
<BR>
	My world stopped for a few seconds. I hadjust blown my cover. I couldn't go on with this job, I could go to jail or something. The thoughts raced through my mind as I fled the area. I was only hunter and nothing more now. <BR>
<B><BR>
Setting: New York, New York<BR>
							</B>I woke up, my vision adjusted to my surroundings. I moved around in the van, grabbing my gear. I strapped my vest on, I had gotten it from my last FBI mission. My leather trench coat was placed on. Guns were put into their holders, knives were inserted into my vest sockets. A shot gun was strapped to my back. I was ready for anything now. <BR>
	<BR>
<B>Setting:  Giovanni Building</B><BR>
	The van drove through the city night. My eyes moved around on the busy road. Various sounds were in the background. I stopped by the building. <B>Krrring </B>I was inside now. "Hello Sir" A man stood at a good 6'9", long black hair rolled down from his shoulders. He wore a black italian suit, mirror shades sat infront of his eyes. There was a gun holstered at his wait, he looked down to me. "Yes, I'm looking for room 39" I grinned to him, my voice was normal. "Right this way." There was something I didn't like, but I walked with him anyways. <BR>
<BR>
	We got into an elevator and he pushed 2. He stood like a giant, and exited, I followed. My right hand was hidden behind my back, I felt the cool shotgun against my palm. We entered the room.<B> CLICK! </B> The lights flashed away. It was a set up..How did they know I was going to do the hit?! <B>BRRRRRRR!!!!!! </B>The loud sound of an automatic fgun filled the room, aside from the usual sounds of instructions. I jumped behind a table, pushing it down. It was time for cover. <BR>

	Punks..I was out numbered. There was only one thing I could do. Fight to the death. There was too much to give up. I pulled the shotgun out, the air ran through my face, shots were fired. I shot in every direction. My brother had told me vampires could see through the dark. I would have the lower advantage. An Idea was born. My lighter was switched on, I threw it to the ground. Fire lit the room, it would be suicide now, but oh well. I shot  every last one of them. They fell like flies. I won...<BR>
<BR>
	Th burning of wood shook the winning thought out of my mind..What good would winning do if I wasn't alive?! I glanced around the room, looking for an exit..A glass window attracted my attention. I jumped forward, feeling glass enter my skin as I fell to through the window. Water was every where, I glanced around, I was in a pool. I swam out only to find men every where. THey were most likely ghouls of the vampires who ran this place..I ran like a hunted dog...<BR>

						</B>"GET OVER HERE!!!" He flew into a row of bottles, all shattering, alcohol crawled all over his body as his weak eyes looked to me. "I w--wo--wont tell yoou ahnything.." I got closer to him, my foot smashed into his jaw. His teeth fell, blood bubbled out of his mouth. I shot an arrow into his chest. "uuhhfgg" I hit him again, this time with my fist, accross his face. "TELL ME!" I glared down to him. "F-Fi-fine..." he took a long pause.."WHERE WAS YOUR SIRE FROM?!" I yelled in his face.."Vo-voletta, Isle of voletta" I left, his talking was done..<BR>
