These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Gabriel was born in 1972 in New Orleans.  However, he grew up in France and lived there most of his life.  He was raised by his mother Monique, his father having died when he was 2 years old.  His father had been a vampire slayer like his father before him, and thus the mantle was to be passed on to Gabriel.  But being that Gabriel's father died when he was so young, there was not alot of training that could be done.  Gabriel's mother, however, had been able to teach him the basics about protection against vampires, and the different methods of destroying them, as Gabriel's father had taught her in order to protect her.  Being a notorious slayer, Gabriel's father had constantly been hunted by vampires, and he knew that Monique would be in constant danger from these vampires.  Ironically, Monique survived, but it was Gabriel's father that was eventually taken down by a gang of the undead.  <BR>
	Gabriel wanted to be a vampire slayer like his father, but he was more interesting in writing.  He did very well in school, and was given a scholarship to a school in America, where he majored in English Literature.  In his senior year, a short story he had written was published in a collection, and Gabriel was paid $1000 for his story.  He became serious about becoming a writer at this point, and managed to land a deal with a moderately large publisher.  Slaying became second priority, though he never forgot what he'd learned.  <BR>
	When he finished college he wrote his first book.  It made the best seller list for 10 weeks, and landed him an even better deal with his publisher.  He decided he wanted to write a gothic, occult-oriented novel.  The interest in the subject, of course, came from what his mother had taught him.  And though he understood the basic mechanics of vampires, he had never really experienced them firsthand.  He went to his mother, asking her where he could go to experience the occult better.  She asked him to take his mind off of it and not bother going to such a dangerous place, but she she saw she could not shake him, she told him about Isle Voletta, but did not mention that it was the town in which his father had been killed.  And so he went.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
