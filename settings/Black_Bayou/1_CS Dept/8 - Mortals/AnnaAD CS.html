</B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

<B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> 2d6+Body+Music vs. victim's 2d6+Mind+Soul / Instant; this takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> For ages, music's soothing quality has been known to calm both humans and beasts.  Some musicians have learned to harness this quality of music, especially in their endeavors with those creatures of the night.  Any character which succumbs to the effect may not make any aggressive actions.  This includes attacking and using aggressive masteries or spells.  Although they <U>will</U> defend themselves, even though defending may potentially harm another.  If the player using this has lore level 3 for whatever breeds are affected, then those in their "true" breed form will revert back to their "mortal" form.  The player may not choose who is effected.  All characters who hear the music are affected.  The single die roll made by the musician above is compared to the rolls of all the individuals who are within hearing range (50 feet outside or the same room inside) to determine who is affected.  Meaning they may make no other actions, aggressive, defensive, or otherwise until the mastery has lost its effect.  The user may choose to end the mastery prematurely at the end of any round before the next wave of initiative begins.  On the other hand, the user may need stop the use of the mastery to defend themselves.  These effects are subtle and the victims will have no idea the music created the effect unless the musician is obvious about their intentions.  Remember that Steel Will is added to all Will rolls in the game.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>She was born on a blustery autumn morning on 1972. Her name, however, was quite the controversial issue. Her mother and father never agreed on too much of anything. They did love one another though, very much. Her father, Daryl, wanted to name her Darylyn after himself. Her mother, Kennedy, wanted to name her Alana, after her mother. The solution, compromise! They chose Anna. Anna Alana Darylyn Blaul. Her life was absolutely perfect.. when she was growing up. Her mother dressed her in frilly little dresses and pink buckle shoes. She was put in "Little Princess" beauty pageants and "Search for the Stars" shows where her mother could flaunt her daughter's beauty. The perfect little girl on the outside. Inside, however, she was tormented. It wasn't till she was about 13 years old that her mother finally noticed something was wrong. Anna had an anxiety attack. She spent about 3 months in a mental hospital for teens. A place where they denied her of anything that might assist her in harming herself and she felt like a prisoner. When she was released, she swore up and down she was fine. But her inner torment continued. She took up writing poetry and playing guitar. When she was 16 she ran away. She spent a few nights in her car on the side of the road and was eventually found and returned home. Her mother didn't care that she was feeling pain. She didn't want anyone to know that the president of the PTA's daughter was an unhappy deviant. So, Anna looked for new ways to express her pain. She started having sex with numerous people and was soon known as the school skank. She did drugs and smoked and anything she thought would help shield her from the pain. As Anna's reputation fell so did her mother's. Her home life suffered because of it. Kennedy started fights with Daryl and Anna every chance she got. When Anna was 17, her parents divorced and Anna moved in with her father. She spent a few years at home where she could reflect on her past problems and develop herself into a better person. She took up kick boxing as a hobby and then joined a band. For a while, she played in clubs, making her living that way. But, she tired of that easily and decided to move out of her fathers house to make herself a life. At 24, she moved to South Carolina and met a man named Joe. He was a lawyer and made good money. He thought her musical talent was great and promised her the world. They married and lived happily till she found him sleeping around with his secretary. She divorced him and swore never to get involved with a lawyer again. Anna packed her things up and moved down to Lousiana. She spent a year in Baton Rouge then moved to Isle Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
