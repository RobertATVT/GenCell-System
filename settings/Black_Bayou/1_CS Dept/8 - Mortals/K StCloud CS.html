<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

	Kian is approximately five foot ten inches in height, though he was born with a frame suitable for heavy sports his interests to not flow in that direction and thus he has a tendency to remain somewhat out of shape, giving a soft look to his scholarly features.  Though he dresses for comfort, Kian's definition of this is long sleeved shirts and slacks or black dress pants despite the weather.  Having fallen to the gothic sect in high school, the twenty-six year old man still does not leave the house without his black longcoat and a silver tipped cane, though the later is as much function as it is style, for the man was diagnosed at the age of twenty-four with a degenerative joint disease that is slowly robbing him of his ability to function without increasing amounts of pain.  Do to his time as an actor and his field of study, Kian can be a very charming individual, however, never is one likely to meet a person with a greater degree of self loathing, a trait that often causes him to retreat a situation before his charms can gain him what he wants, for certainty he will fail.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Born in April of nineteen hundred and seventy-five, Kian began his life son to a pair of modern day pioneers ... travelers who made it their business to fill the endless hours with strange locals and the smell of the open road, today we call them hippies.  As people age, however, their adventurous spirit wanes and it was not long before the blossoming family settled down on the outskirts of a little town Nancy Reagan would later dub the marijuana capital of America.  Despite the surroundings, the couple became quite responsible now that they had a child to clip their wings and purchased a large plot of land which they would inevitably harvest to build a home.  Removed from the nearest town by a number of miles, it could be no surprise to anyone that young Kian's closest friends would become those he created within the recesses of his necessarily active imagination.  For the first portion of his life Kian lived happily enough, too young to care for the lack of companionship and too naive to realize how emotionally abusive his father was to his mother.  This would all change at the age of five, however, for it was then that his mom had another child; and it was then that Kian's joy would be shattered.  Infatuated with the new child, the child's father forgot him entirely, save when he needed a target for his endless stream of physical and emotional abuse.  Indeed, only the new infant was exempt from these outbursts and this would lay the foundation for that families life for many years to come.  Having nothing greater to occupy his time, the older boy spent many hours rampaging through the forest that surrounded his home, avoiding the wrath of his father and creating worlds within his head.  This was likely most to blame for his oddity while growing up.  When he entered school the boy was anything but exemplary, though his imagination knew no bounds his teachers feared for his ability to learn to read and write, going so far as to enroll him in special classes designed to keep him on level with the rest of his age group.  So convinced where the faculty of the boys lacking that they attempted to hold him back twice in his grade school career, his mother being the only object that prevented this as well as acting the buffer between school and family when the boy was found to possess an unusual number of bruises for a child so typically subdued.  As grammar school faded and middle school rose to take its place Kian found himself trapped with the same children he had spent the first portion of his life, children who had come to consider him too strange to like and too emotional to treat with any measure of respect.  So as it had been in his first six years, the next two were passed as an outcast, forsaken by everyone.  Only one kind teacher and his discovered gift for mathematics making the time bearable.  When high school came, Kian found himself bereft of any true emotion, the years of torment had caused him to become morose and cynical, believing that each new day was but a punishment for some wrong he could not recall having committed.  This was before he found a place in the theatre club, however.  It was everything the young man could hope for, the people were accepting and kind, willing to embrace his differences and treat him like the individual he had always knew he could be; and for two years the pain subsided if only faintly.  But a dark cloud hung over Kian's life, and it did not take long for him to become an outcast among the very people who had once taken him in so readily.  As was his practice, Kian sought his sanctuary in books.  Having always possessed an active imagination, and having succumbed to the innate superstition that follows the acting field so closely, the young man began spending his time researching the paranormal, perhaps on some level he felt he could relate to this unseen world better than his own, perhaps he thirsted for the escapism it could give him.  Whatever the reasons, his research began with UFO's, for which he possessed a keen interest.  This was not enough, however, and soon the course of his investigations took him through the world of Vampires, Werewolves, and monsters of every shape and size.  It was in this time that he encountered his first truly dangerous spirit.  Living in so small a town, ripe with history of murder and cruelty, Kian could not have possibly grown up without having some contact with ghosts; indeed twice in his life he had known the company of restless spirits, one in a place he had visited on many an occasion, the other in the guesthouse hidden within the trees of his parents abode. (to which he had taken to staying in since the age of sixteen)  None of this had prepared him for the monstrosity he encountered in the forest behind the house of a friend, however.  The night had been silent, the air did not stir, the sounds of nature so prevalent in such a town had vanished, as if a dark shroud had been pulled over the hearts of every creature in the soilent world.  Truth be told they had not known what it was they were doing that night, slipping into the shaded woods as if following the call of destiny.  What they encountered, however, would leave its mark upon their souls and their lives for years to come.  To this day if he were asked, Kian would refer to the beast they encountered in that place as a demon.  So malevolent was it that the entity's very presence had nearly frozen the hearts in their chests, nearly twisted their minds and burned from them the purity of their souls.  In the end those who were present would tell that only the grace of God saved them.  In the end it was probably true.  This event, traumatic as it was, began a cycle in Kian's life.  For four years he sought out every haunted house, every forgotten graveyard that he could find the location of .. ever seeking to understand just what it was he had touched that night and in the process he opened a way to the larger world he had previously only dreamed of.  Though his paranormal studies progressed, the boys school life was allowed to suffer and though it could hardly be argued that the previous estimations of his intellect were misplaced, the fact that he allowed his studies to go unattended nearly cost him his diploma and certainly cost him any opportunity for scholarship and dreams for the future.  Nonetheless the young man was able to keep a job with his parents janitorial business and easily made enough money to escape the fiery temper of his father when he turned eighteen.  At the age of twenty Kian moved to a larger town and for a time forgot his studies of the macabre, turning his efforts to living a normal and hopefully pleasant life as a customer service employee. (having quite working for his parents after his father accused him of stealing form their business)  Though the desire was there, the now man's life still hung beneath the shadow of a dark cloud and the lack of loyal friends followed him into his adult life.  During this period, the social outcast learned many hard lessons of life .. among them that he could trust no one, probably the strongest and hardest forgot lesson of his days.  This became even more correct when he discovered at the age of twenty-two that he could not even trust himself as he lay in his bed one night and swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills.  Kian's misery was not to end in this manner, however, and even as he felt the life slipping form his limbs his eyes fell upon the sight of deaths angel come to receive him as he was given his last chance .. and despite his self loathing and hatred of the world in which he lived, the boy made a choice that left him sick and delusional for the rest of the eve, but prolonged his life for at least a time.  This scrape with death did not pass without leaving its mark on the man child's life, however, and soon after he readdressed his efforts to the higher schooling he had thus far neglected, eventually receiving his degree in English literature; a degree that gave him the editing job he possesses today.  This near miss had another effect on the man's psyche as well and when not pursuing his efforts to make a better life for himself, he renewed his investigations into the unexplained, eventually finding reference to a backwater, superstitious little town in the Louisiana swamp land.  <BR>
