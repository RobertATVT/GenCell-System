<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

Sebastian is 48 years old and looks every bit his age.  An old war injury has left him with a limp that necessitates the use of a cane for walking.  Sebastian's cane is made of ebony with a sterling silver head shaped like a rose in full bloom.  The injury has also left a long scar stretching from his forehead to his ear that can be mostly concealed with a brimmed hat; Sebastian often wears a black brimmed hat.  As a sign of mourning, Sebastian never wears color.  Since Sebastian is nearly blind he wears thick round, black rimmed glasses.  His silver hair lies in shoulder-lengthy, wavy locks, and a well trimmed beard and mustache surround his mouth.  Other than his obvious disabilities, Sebastian is healthy and trim standing about 5' 11".<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Sebastian White grew up in a rural Virginian town.  He was born illegitimately in 1951 to a young woman named Faith White, who had studied liberal arts at Berkley.  Sebastian inherited her love of the arts.  Most of his youth was spent painting, sculpting, drawing, etc while listening to his mother's LP records (Their genres stretched from classical symphonic selections to classic rock n' roll.).  Sebastian always succeeded in his studies at school although he took little interest in them.  Love struck just before high school when he met a girl named Rose Took.  They became acquaintances, then friends, and then sweethearts.  As they grew older, they grew together, and so soon after graduation they were married.  Sebastian had become extremely happy, and so was Rose, but that would not last long...   In 1969 Sebastian was drafted into the war with Vietnam.  He worked as a medic, a very talented medic, who ended up saving many lives.  Unfortunately, the Vietcong attacked his platoon and Sebastian was nearly killed when a bomb exploded just outside his tent.  The blast left his body badly injured; to this day Sebastian must walk with a cane, suffers from back pain, has a scar just stretching from the inside of his left brow to his left ear lobe, cannot see without thick glasses, and is unable to reproduce.  After the bombing, Sebastian was, at first, thought to be dead with the rest of his platoon, so Rose received a tragic letter in the mail.  Upon the false news of Sebastian's death, Rose White committed suicide.  When Sebastian was found and revived, he was sent home.  It wasn't until he returned that he discovered the death of his wife.  When he did he fell into a deep depression.  He even gave up art, and stopped wearing clothes that had any colors.  After a bleak period of living with his mom in Virginia, Sebastian collected himself as best as he could so he could get a job, move out, and try to overcome his sorrow.  He worked in a local motel as the midnight shift clerk.  Round this time he began writing, his first step back into the world of art.  Before long, Sebastian had amassed a small collection of poems and short stories.  Taking Faith's advice, he took his writings to a publisher who was impressed, thus Sebastian published his first volume of poetry entitled Shards of Glass under the pen name "Job Grey".  Over the next decade, he published more volumes of poems and short stories (Nightmares or Ghosts, Under a Red Moon, 13 Anatomies) which won him high marks in literary circles and universities.  Then in 1988, Sebastian published his first, and only, novel, When the Dead Come Home, under his true name, Sebastian Elliott White.  The book was an immediate success reaching best-seller status.  He toured universities giving lectures on the novel.  With the money that he earned from the book, he bought an old plantation house in New Orleans.  Five years later, he published another book of poems, As Rose Petals Blacken, as Job Grey.  Despite all his success, Sebastian never got over Rose's death, and after the last book of poetry was published he lapsed into another period of deep depression; this one lasted for three years.  Although he would eventually come out of it, he found his ability to write to be blocked from his mind completely.  In despair and desperation, Sebastian once again toured the universities trying to regain what he had lost.  He cut the tour short feeling that it was not going to work and decided to take a vacation.  Trying to find a secluded, quiet place, Sebastian stumbled across Isle Voletta in an old travel guide, and he thought it fitting and practical since it was somewhat close to home, so he planned a two week get away to the Island of Veils.  After a week, he had fallen in love with the quaint city and decided to stay there indefinately.  After awhile, he negan to think about moving there, perhaps opening a small business, like a restraunt, better yet, a poetry house.  The more he thought of it the more he liked it.   Having made up his mind, Sebastion left Voletta to go to business school where he would learn the ins and outs running a business.  Now, Sebastion sleeps on an airplane once again headed for Isle Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
