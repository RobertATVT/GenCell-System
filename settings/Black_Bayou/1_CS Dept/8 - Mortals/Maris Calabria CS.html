<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 Appearance (clothes, etc.):</B> Dark brown [ kissed by hours in the sun ] flows in rich luxery down the slope of her back. Skin the color creamy coffee [ some call it mulatto ] is offset by the most curious pair of moss green eyes.  These sparkle [ could there be a devil hiding in this seeming angel? ] with laughter, or flash with anger [ a temper passed down from the Irish, her mother said ] depending on her mood.  A thin, straight nose, then full pouty lips [ kiss me if you dare ], angelic visage completed only by the stubborn set of a pointed chin. Dressed most often in hiphuggers [ black and sleek ], and oversized sweaters, or little excuses for shirts [ if you've got it, flaunt it].  Maris - what a dreamer.  A romantic, little angel. [ Looks can be so deceiving. ]<BR>

</B>Maris Calabria was born early morning, on February the 16th.  The firstborn, and only child of Anthony and Isabelle Calabria had all money could give her.<BR>
<BR>
She called Atlanta, GA her home.  The most expensive of toys were offered to her, then as she reached her teen years, electronics and clothes replaced the toys.  <BR>
<BR>
Her schooling was the most expensive.  Private schools, etiquette classes.  All these managed to give her an outer sheen, but never penetrated the person inside.<BR>
<BR>
Maris was the one behind all the trouble.  When everyone got straight A's, one semester, Maris was the brains behind it.  Although, two other girls were found to be guilty - and when their accusing fingers pointed to Maris, the teachers just laughed.<BR>
<BR>
She's always had a knack for computers.  With a few pointers picked up from various places at University - Notre Dame, of course - Maris' knowledge grew even more.<BR>
<BR>
She graduated with a degree in Computer Science.  However, Maris knew long before that she wasn't interested in working at the.. typical desk job.<BR>
<BR>
Petty robberies began to be reported in Atlanta, ever summer that Maris came home.  But these weren't petty at all.  The thief wasn't targeting the norm, electronics and expensive gadgets.  One item at a time was being taken.  Small valuables - something each family cherished.<BR>
<BR>
This could be a photo album from years and years ago.  Or the Monet bought from an exclusive sale in New York.<BR>
<BR>
But Atlanta has lost some of its appeal, and so Maris has moved on, and has no found herself stuck (briefly she hopes) in a little town, with mysteries and quirks of its own.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
