System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Born in the bustling city of busy Hong Kong, China, Lei Hotoro aka Rocky, grew up into a basically rich family. <BR>
	His father was a Japanese man, named Tenchi Hotoro, that worked for a business trade company based in Tokyo, Japan. Having been transferred to Hong Kong, he met up with a beautiful Chinese woman by the name of Shannon Wang. They were married and Shannon bore two children to Tenchi. One a boy and the other a girl. The boy was the first born, and was named Lei. But for his strong will he was soon nicknamed Rocky. His little sister was born a year later, around the same time her cousin Lina Hotoro was born. Lei's sister is named Julie.<BR>
	The next year when he turned 3 years old, Tenchi, got a visit from his from his brother from Enzan. Tetsuro Hotoro came in to take a look on his little brother on the family he had created in Hong Kong. In is visit he brought little Lina along for the ride, he told Tenchi that he left Ryu back with his mother. Lei and Julie took a couple of glances at the two year old Lina. Lei came up to Tetsuro and poked the child's side, causing it to giggle. Lei rubbed his nose and smiled. As Tetsuro and Tenchi exchanged their good-byes, Tetsuro reminded his brother that the next day would be Ryu's 5th birthday and he would be delighted to invite them to the park for a picnic. Tenchi made no promises but he said that he would try to be there...<BR>
<BR>
	It was that same day, that Tetsuro and Ryoko Hotoro were brutally murdered. The two children were not to be heard of again. Overcome by grief of his brother's loss, he looked on his own family and granted that nothing would happen to them...<BR>
<BR>
	Lei's mother was originally born in the US, her family moved back to China because of family problems. Due to his status as a half-breed Lei is occasionally harassed by the other Chinese boys. So, he studied under Koh, master of many styles of martial arts and owner of a restaurant in Hong Kong. So, by the next two years, Lei had already mastered most of Tai Chi, but to himself he thought he needed more learning. <BR>
	<BR>
	Now, graduated from college and a successful youn man, Lei wandered around Hong Kong with his long-time sweet-heart Cynnara Soto. They have been dating for five years, and for some reason, Lei was too nervous to ask her to marry him. She knew what he wanted to ask but just wanted him to overcome his fear and come out and say it. Unfortunately, when he did gain the courage to ask for a commitment Cynnara she for some reason mysteriously moved away. For reasons he couldn't comprehend. So with a broken heart, Lei wandered some more around Hong Kong until he wanted to find out if he had any other family members out in the world. Finding a new purpose and something to fill in the gap that was just created in his life, Lei went to his father to ask him about his other relatives. <BR>
	After his father explained to him that his uncle and aunt had been murdered in Enzan years ago, he began to wonder. "Hey! Didn't they have kids?" Trying to hide the information, Tenchi regarded his question at first. "Hey, come on old man! Tell me! I'm bored out of my mind stuck here! And I don't tend to be no couch potato, look at this six-pack...don't want to let it go to waste!" He smirked as he patted his flat stomach. A bit amused by his son's ackward inquiry of trying to find his lost relatives, Tenchi only gave him enough info that would at least help him out halfway. <BR>
	<BR>
	Pleased with his skills of tracking and hunting, he looked all around Enzan, Japan, only to have one name pop up, Voletta. "Hmm...Voletta, huh? Sounds like fun." Traveling by plane, Lei smiled as he might actually enjoy this little family reunion...maybe...</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
