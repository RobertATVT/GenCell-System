 They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B> </B>Timothy Sloans, or Toar Sloans, was born in the early 70's to a well put together family.  3 siblings, all older than him by considerable years also lived in his rather large house.  Conneticut was your average state, not having too much to offer, but also nothing to complain about at the same time.  <BR>
 His oldest sister got married at age 26, when he was only 10.  His parents were rather old to be raising a son of such a young age.  They weren't like other parents, trying to raise him the same way they raised their otehr children over a decade ago.  This led to tension between him and his parents, especially in his teen years.<BR>
 Watching the older siblings leave in their twenties, Timothy decided he'd try and outshine them just a little.  But, despite hard work, he had the same grades as the average Sloan, and could do little to impress his aging parents.<BR>
 At age 18, his father died, leaving his mother a large fortune.  Toar watched hsi health... his father died of a Heartattack at what was considered to be a pretty young age to do so.  With siblings and family members mourning, Toar watched rather then open up to them.  It wasn't him to do so.<BR>
 He considered going into the medical field at first, but always wanted to be a police officer when he was younger.  An opportunity close enough to such a job camme up, an investigator, looking for at least 2 years of college at a county school, which Toar had just received.  <BR>
 He got the job at age 21, and was trained very basic police training.  At age 26, he was assigned to cases that it seemed like the FBI might handle.  Things he had never heard of before were involved.  Demons... Vampires... but he didn't believe one bit of it.  2 months into the murder case, the FBI was ordered to take over, but the case had strange effects on Toar.  WHile he convinced himself not to believe in such creatures of the dark, a "fear" led him to quit.  He now moves to Voletta to look for a new job.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
