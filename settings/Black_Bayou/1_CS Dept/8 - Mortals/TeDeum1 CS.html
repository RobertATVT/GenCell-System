I have reduced your Acting to Level 4 and reimbursed you the 10 XP's it would cost to buy the Acting Level 5.

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

Graduting high school magically before him even though she cut classes most of the time,her brain made up for her absence.She was never really shelter by her mum and dad,they wanted their children to "learn and experience life" of their own.She lost her virginity when she was 12 she remebered the fucker who had dragged her to the woods and raped her she rembered coming home and telling her mummy what had happened and her mum just saying "Well dear you shouldn't play with boys twice your age." then skooting her off...that's when Gannon became very unaware of her mothers presneces any where near her,she just blotted her out.She did remember Alec's reaction though and how the guy that had done that had been on his wrestling team and how he nearly had his back broke at the nezt wrestling match.That is when she knew she could only trust her brother and that is all.Gannon switched to girls only after that then slowly opened back up to trusting guys also.She moved to Volletta to take an modeling job for Mrs. Angeleen Dark.She bought a small apartment a couple blocks away from the Facade or the symp how ever you wish to refer to it.She rides a black and chrome motorcycle,die fast live fast too.<BR>
