  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some mortals have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Name:</B> Claire Angelica Ansel<BR>
  <B>Age and/or birth date:</B> October 13, 1969<BR>
  <B>Occupation: </B>Pediatric Physician<BR>
  <B>Equipment/weapons:</B> Medical bag, books, pin, 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible<BR>
  <B>Background:</B><BR>
  This Peach, born and raised in Georgia, had a special ability from a young age. Open and able to speak with the angels above, Claire sought their guidance during very trying times in her life. Not only in tune with herself and the world around her, Claire was able to tune herself into special people in her life. Family, a few friends, and a loved one. Only a few could truly understand her.<BR>
  The youngest of five children, Claire knew at an early age that she wanted to be a doctor. Her father was a family physician, having a practice in the small town in which they resided; she knew she wanted to work with children. And so she studied medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, like her father did so many years prior.<BR>
  It had taken her many years of frustration to get her to college. A learning disability, dyslexia, went undetected and kept her from functioning at her potential. Guidance from her angels gave her the strength to become an honor's student and then attend the prestigious university and medical school.<BR>
  At the age of 16, Claire was involved in an automobile accident, in which her friend - the driver- was killed. This devastated Claire, leaving her to question everything and pushing the angels and her beliefs aside. It was after meeting Aisa Grigori that her belief and faith were restored. A small gift, an angel pin, was left after their meeting and from that point on, Claire knew they were destined to meet again. And they did.<BR>
  Beyond college and medical school, Claire returned home and established a pediatric practice with her father's help. Due to demand in the small town, Claire also served as a midwife. Her first gift to herself was a blue 1967 Ford Mustang Convertible.<BR>
  Her entrance into Voletta did not come without loss. The death of her paternal grandfather, a great loss to everyone, especially Claire, is the reason for her journey. It was no surprise that his small home and land in Voletta were left to her; their special bond was something always questioned, but he was one person that understood her. <BR>
