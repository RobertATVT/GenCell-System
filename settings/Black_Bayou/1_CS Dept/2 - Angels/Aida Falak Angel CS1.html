<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or GM or ST has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Volange</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use. (##Volange##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B>NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Even though an angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from angel to angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to be a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While an angel is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</B>Almost wholly dissimilar to the mortal seeming,  the angel's flesh has a gilded, almost internal incandescence of bronze, dark golden hair tumbling free about slender shoulders, gray-green eyes gleaming as if lit from within. The external evidence of the body form's gender is reduced, the slim figure assuming an andrognyous quality, clothed sparingly in a loose drapes of shimmery, intangible light that might resemble white silk, hanging from one shoulder to shroud the chest at an angle, and again about the hips to brush the upper thighs. Bare feet and hands are obscured by the pale brilliance of the aura, the angel's compassion in its function as a death-herald of the Light stilling the lovely features, a pair of ivory-feathered and gold-tipped wings folded neat at its back, the pinions dripping down with the aura's glow.</I>    <BR>

Extended Mindspeak</I> - 1 Soul to use.  (as mindspeak)<BR>
Generation Cost:</B> 5<B> </B>/<B> Experience Cost:</B> 25<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The angel has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the angel to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the angel is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the angel must reactivate it due to the stress of combat. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN see below / see below; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can become the epitome of what it was meant to be:  the impartial observer, making unknown subtle changes for good.  The angel becomes invisible to all sight, including infrared and all sound, though not imperceptible with touch or scent.  As an option, the angel may be visible to one other person, but no more than one.  TN is 22 to turn invisible to all and 24 to be visible to only one person.  Should the angel exceed a target number of 28, they will be able to touch and otherwise communicate normally with the selected target.  The mastery remains in effect until the angel is either touched, attacks or otherwise comes into contact with someone else physically.       <BR>

</B></I>Aida is 23 years of age, of average height (5'6") and slender build (115 lbs) with a spare, almost boyish frame. Her skin is a medium olive tone, her hair pitch-dark and faintly highlighted with mahogany, her eyes an eerily consistent pale green. She's reasonably attractive of feature, though not classically so, evidently Arabic of heritage, with a long, slim face (and an aquiline nose to match) and juttingly hollowed cheekbones, thinnish lips. Said features contribute to a rather severe look when matched with back-swept hair and the silver wire-rims she dons in the classroom, but in casual company she prefers the jeans-and-tee-shirts uniform.      <BR>

<B><I>Aida Sabirah Falak</B></I> (Arabic, meaning in part, "reward" and "star" for a surname...had to have some kind of a tie-in to "Stella"), native of New York, NY, born and raised, the youngest daughter of second-generation Lebanese-American parents. Sort of a drifter by nature, she graduated from NYU with a B.A. in English literature and intended to be a teacher, but after a couple years working in New York public high schools didn't  find teaching as rewarding a path as she'd hoped, and gave her resignation with the end of the winter break. Her father is an oil executive, rather well-off to say the least, and highly displeased with her choice to quit teaching, as he was never thrilled that she was teaching at public school (besides staunchly refusing to be wed to any of the men of his choice) in the first place. The family is not particularly devout, religiously (Sunni) but Aida's personal faith is unshakable, and she knows that the Light is leading her on the correct path, and will have her do as she is fated. A half-hearted job search in other regions of the country leads her to an available position at Voletta's public high school, and much to the increasing displeasure of her parents, she decides she is going to pursue that position. After begging and pleading for a loan from them and adding that to her meagre savings, she trucks down to Louisiana to attempt to start a new life. Azrael has, of course, been subtly directing this sequence of events since recently being embraced by the mortal Aida- the Light would have its angel of death at the side of Voletta's archangel, to aid in the goals and pursuits of the angelic flock in Voletta.     <BR>
