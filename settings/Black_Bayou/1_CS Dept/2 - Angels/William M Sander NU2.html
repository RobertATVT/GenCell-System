 They are called many things from Stage Hand, Entertainment Assistant, Makeup Artist, Best Boy, Grip, Lighting Director, what have you.  These are the people who actually make the magic happen during an entertainment event.  They apply the make-up, they make sure the lighting is just right and ensure the smoke pots will ignite right on cue.  They run the mixing boards and the laser light shows.  Without their creative talents, Metallica might look more like The Dixie Chicks on stage...and The Dixie Chicks more like the Grinch who Stole Christmas.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or GM or ST has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Even though an angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from angel to angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to be a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While an angel is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can fill any character with a brief and overwhelming sense of compassion and amity.  If timed correctly, the person may follow through on some action they would not have done otherwise, i.e., giving to charity, befriending a lost soul, lending advice.  Using this gift to derive personal benefit is considered a grave sin.  This mastery can force another character out of their True forms (i.e., Horus, TVF, TAF, etc.).  If successful target is filled with compassion, -3 to Attack for duration.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>William Matthew Sanders was born in 1974 in Ireland. His parents were rich and very much respected business men. Until he was sixteen he lived an extremely typical life. He went to parties, dated, got good grades, and was generally a good guy. On his sixteenth birthday as he returned home from a party thrown for him by a group of friends he found his parents waiting for him at the door. There faces an eclectic mix of solemn excitement.<BR>
 	It was then that they introduced him to his lineage. As they explained it there family were descendants of Sandors Ignatius Sanders, the founder of a group known as The Ancients. This group were the watchers of the world the bearers of magics, and protectors of the innocent. With this Wil was shocked unable to even contemplate this, but as they continued the Ancients themselves had no inherent power, instead they had a natural propensity to be drawn to it. As they finished explaining this to Wil they informed him that they were sending him to America, to a small cabin in Pennsylvania where, with the help of his grandfather (Roger Sanders) he would learn all he would need to know to carry on the families lineage.<BR>
 	Three years passed as Wil was trained under the expert tutelage of Roger. He learned the skills necessary to be discreet and retain information. He was also introduced to the texts of the Ancients, which recorded there exploits for centuries. At the sight of what seemed like a library of knowledge Wil was at Awe, unable of even conceiving how all of this information could be written, even more Awed at what he heard next. "You will read, and memorize it all" Were the next words from his grandfather. Needless to say, Wil was stunned.<BR>
 	It took Wil another three years of nearly constant study, reading and rereading this tombs which often times ranged in languages from French to Ancient Greek. This entire time his grandfather began to grow weaker and more sickly. Will had grown into a strong young man, the physical and mental training giving him a new sense of being, and the knowledge of the Ancients giving him a new sense of purpose. Sadly Roger died just after Wil completed his studies, leaving Wil with the knowledge necessary to survive.<BR>
 	Knowledge however came with a price, Wil had become cold, much more aloof than he previously was. His heart remained pure, but on the outside at times he could even seem mean. That's why he found it difficult when he finally returned to the outside world.<BR>
 	He traveled for two years, searching out the magics that seemed to evade him at every turn. Each time he believed he found what he was looking for, he found it to be false and superficial. Being an Ancient, although he did pick up some of this, which he used when he returned to the States to become a world class magician.<BR>
 	He spent only months at this until he felt the calling on the magic returning. He needed, had to find at and he wouldn't rest until he did. He finally, after expending all other choices decided to travel to a place that seemed to him as another dead-end, Voletta. Here he hopes, but sincerely doubts that he will find what he has sought for so long.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
