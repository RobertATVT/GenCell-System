<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon may take temporary possession of another's body with simple eye contact.  The real person's personality becomes submerged in their subconscious mind.  The demon has full control over the body of the victim.  The host body the demon currently inhabits will be unable to move, think, feel, anything while the demon is controlling the victim.  If the intended victim wins the roll, it is safe from further Control attempts for the rest of the night.  No victim of this mastery may be commanded to cause damage to themselves (jumping in front of a car, shoot themselves, etc.) nor can the demon use the affected target's masteries.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Mind vs victim's 2d6+Soul / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When someone begins to show guilt or the potential guilt for committing some act, the demon is capable of suppressing that guilt, enabling the victim to perform the actions without concern for guilt or conscience.  This works on with any one action the victim is performing.  After the act, the victim will be overcome with more intense guilt than they ever realized was possible (should be role-played in the room and posted).<BR>

Effect/Description: </B> Gives the demon the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The demon may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The demon may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The demon may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> The demon can tap into it's infernal powers to delve deep into the soul of a victim in order to learn their deepest, darkest sins.  The better to tempt them with, my dear. This gives the demon the ability to understand thoughts and even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The demon may IM the victim and ask 3 questions regarding their deepest, darkest sins.  The victim's player must answer these questions as truthfully as the character remembers.  The victim will have no clue, in-character, that the demon has been peering into their soul.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>       </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Jason Kalane was born in the suburbs of New York City in 1973. He was a normal kid in a normal neighborhood, as far as "normal" goes. He did good in school, treated people decently, and just tried to live life as he went. <BR>
	Even at a young age, he knew he wanted to be a police officer when he grew up. He kept this dream alive until one day, at the age of 23, his dream was realized. He became a cop. A good cop. He did his job and he did it well. <BR>
	Jason married in the summer of 1998. One Arianne Parnell. The two loved each other from first sight, and the marriage was almost an afterthought to the feelings they shared. They both had a lifetime of happiness with each other to look forward to...or so they thought. One night, as they were leaving a late night movie, a man assaulted them, seemingly out of nowhere, forcing them into a dark alleyway. Jason tried to fight, but the stranger moved like lightning, and had a power unbefitting his small stature. He literally picked Jason off his feet and threw him into a building wall. Jason felt the lower bone of his leg snap, a burst of pain before his body shut the nerves down. But any pain he had ever felt, any pain he could ever feel, could not match the pain he endured at the sight he beheld over the next several seconds before he passed out. The assailant grabbed Arianne - too terrified to move or scream - around the throat and as if her neck were nothing more then tissue paper, tore it from her torso. The last thing he remembered seeing was the red rose he had given Arianne only minutes before, hitting the ground a fraction of a second before her body. His vision focused on that even as he heard the monster who had taken his love's life screaming in agony. He couldn't see anything now, only hear the sounds of a large dog growling, and the same sound of ripping flesh as when his wife died. <BR>
<BR>
	He awoke to find himself in a bed. Something was covering his mouth. Suddenly everything that had happened came back to him and he jerked upwards, screaming. Several people came running into the room. Nurses, a voice in his mind told him. A sharp prick in his arm, and he felt dazed. He slowly lay back down, passing out again.<BR>
<BR>
	"Jason." <BR>
	"Jason, can you hear me?"<BR>
	"Please, Jason." That voice sounds familiar, Jason thought.<BR>
	"Sweety, I'm here." Yes, that's mom.<BR>
 	A pressure on his hand. "Mom?", he moaned weakly.<BR>
	"Yes! It's me hon."<BR>
	"Where am I?"<BR>
	"You're in the hospital."<BR>
	"Where's Arianne?"<BR>
	Silence.........<BR>
<BR>
	Two weeks later, Jason still couldn't understand, couldn't believe. His wife was gone. Killed. For what? His friends at the precinct had told him there was literally nothing to go on. They had found his wife's body. Found him. Some blood other than the couple's but forensics had come up with nil. He was angry. He hated this world for taking Arianne away from him. And most of all, he hated himself for not being able to stop it from happening. One thing kept him going. Kept him from ending his own life. A need that demanded fulfillment. A need for vengeance. How he would do this he had no idea. But he would not stop. He would do anything it took to find his wife's killer and destroy him! <BR>
	"Really?"<BR>
	Jason started. He looked around his bedroom, where he'd been contemplating in solitude. "Great, now I'm talking to myself."<BR>
	"You're talking to me, too."<BR>
	This time, Jason jumped up, spinning around, looking all over. "Who's there!"<BR>
	"My name is unimportant. What matters is I can help you attain what you desire."<BR>
	"What the hell are you talking about?"<BR>
	"Vengeance. To kill her killer. Is that not what you wish?"<BR>
	A sadness washed over Jason's face, slowly transforming to raw hatred. "Yes! More than anything."<BR>
	"Then let me help you. You can't do it without me."<BR>
	"Who are you? Why would you want to help me?"<BR>
	"As I said, my name doesn't matter. And I want to help you because I want to."<BR>
	"That makes no sense."<BR>
	"YES OR NO! I tire of this. I can help you, do you wish it?"<BR>
	There was no hesitation....."Yes."<BR>
	A dark laughter filled the air. "So be it."<BR>
	And thus, the demon Zephyros, acquired his latest host.<BR>

	1187 AD, Jerusalem<BR>
	Zephyros had been enjoying his toys. These "holy Knights" as they called themselves. His disdain for them and what they stood for fueled his desires to twist and manipulate them for years to come. Killing them one by one had crossed his mind, but where was the fun in that?<BR>
	But this day, he would meet someone who would convince him that a thousand or so could be sacrificed with plenty more to play with elsewhere. <BR>
	Menelaus. One of Zephyros's brethren, perhaps more ancient than himself. Menelaus sought the downfall of Jerusalem, and a little help from Zephyros would be most appreciated. Not that it took much convincing. <BR>
	And so, from that day on, the two demons of hell would bring a little of home to this grand world of men.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
