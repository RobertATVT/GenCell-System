<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

     Though a little short, Amiee isn't at all unattractive.  With perky little features and a cute little nose, she could almost be a porcelin doll.  Her hair is naturally curly, and hangs to her mid back in dark, chocolate brown curls.  Though she does have that adorable quality about her, she's also not got the smiles or personality to match it.  In a serious mood most of the time, there's no mistaking that if one were to try to mess with her too hard, one might find his balls in his stomach.  <g>>></FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>  <BR>

     Amiee Renee Glass was born in the rural area outside of Burlington, Vermont.  Raised by loving parents of the Wicca religion, she had two brothers and one sister (Raymond, Jacob, and Sarah, respectively).  Childhood was a merry time for all, and though her family was a bit different, they were happy.<BR>
<BR>
     All of her siblings were much older than she, and by the time Amiee was 14 years old the only one left living in the household was Sarah.  It was nice, at times, to have someone around the same age to talk to when high school started.  Her family's beliefs and practices didn't win her much popularity.  But when Sarah left for college in Amiee's Junior year, things went haywire.<BR>
<BR>
     In order to 'fit in', Amiee rebelled against her parents and all that they stood for.  This, of course, was heartbreaking to them.  To see their little daughter go through so much...the drugs, the late nights, the numerous 'boyfriends'.  Amiee did graduate, but it certainly wasn't easy.  It was about that time that she started getting things straight.  Almost too late.<BR>
<BR>
     After taking a break for about a year to live with her parents and get things back together again, she went to college.  In order not to have to deal with a lot of flack about her upbringing, she threw herself into her studies and graduated with all A's and B's.  A short time after, she ended up working for a large security company developing their computer software.<BR>
<BR>
     One thing remained the same, however.  Ever since regaining her dignity shortly after high school, she decided never to get involved with men (or boys) again.  They had been nothing but trouble in the past, and she doubted they would ever be anything else.<BR>
<BR>
     Still, she wanted to get out of Vermont.  ANYPLACE was better than Vermont.  She quit her job and took a small-time position in Baton Rouge, LA.  She's currently looking for a place to reside in Volletta...</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
