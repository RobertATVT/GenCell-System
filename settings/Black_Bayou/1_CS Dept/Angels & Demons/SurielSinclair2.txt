</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or GM or ST has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Even though an angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from angel to angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to be a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While an angel is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  When subjected to, and unable to avoid confrontation, the angel will draw on its inner strength to combat any bodily harm it sustains.  A pale aura of gold will surround the angel, visible only to those with the Faith skill.  The angel is more resilient to the damage they can take before the pain begins to affect their abilities.  Celestial Armor absorbs 3 points of damage per round, then any other damage taken during the rest of the round will make it through the armor.  The armor will recharge at the beginning of each round for its duration.  This mastery may only be used once per night. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the angel possesses a natural quickness that allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the angel, as the holy energies within them have enhanced their reactions.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e., Evasion and Reflexes).</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	In the fall of 1994 there was a party going on. A house  was vibrating as the music inside rattled windows and the students inside made much worse things happen. Many of the college students had too much to drink which could account for the washer and dryer on the lawn. It is an indisputable matter of fact however, that drinking caused what happened next. <BR>
<BR>
	"Hey Jeff! I'll see you later, man. Me and Erica are going up to the bridge!" Adam grinned and, judging by Erica's reaction, had done something with the hand which wasn't waving in the air. Adam had consumed too much alcohol and Jeffrey, a third year medical student, knew what that meant in terms of reaction time and reasoning..especially when it came to driving.<BR>
<BR>
	"Wait up, man! I'll drive you up there, let me get Megan!" Jeffrey hurried inside to find his date. He found her in short order and pulled her from the party, not wanting Adam to do anything stupid. Unfortunately, even as he stepped from the house, Adam and Erica had already started up the blue Corolla and were on their way from the house. "We've got to catch them!" Jeff pulled Megan, who wasn't quite sure what was going on, into the Civic and gave chase. The two cars zoomed into the night towards fate. By the time Adam saw the semi-tractor trailor it was too late. The Corolla was slammed and thrown off of the road where it rolled, five times, and burst into flames. "Ohmigod," both Megan and Jeffrey said in unison and shortly thereafter, Jeff burst from the Civic and headed towards the flaming wreckage. He managed to pull Erica, barely concious, from the flaming wreckage. There was a large laceration in her neck and he ripped off his coat and pressed it to her neck to try and stop the bleeding. He beckoned to Megan, nearly in shock, and she exited the Civic as well to assist Erica as Jeff went back in for Adam. Even as Jeff was breaking the driver's side window to get in, the gas line was dripping next to the flames. Just as Jeffrey freed Adam, who he hadn't realized was already dead, from the constraints of his seat belt the car exploded and Jeffrey Michael Sinclair left the mortal coil. <BR>
<BR>
	The people of Jeffrey's hometown constructed a memorial on campus for his heroic deeds which were given in detail a few days later by the trucker and the two women involved. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
