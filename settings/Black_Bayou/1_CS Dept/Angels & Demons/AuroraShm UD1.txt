The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

 <B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

System/Duration: roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or GM or ST has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Volange</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use. (##Volange##)<BR>
System/Duration: NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
Effect/Description:  Even though an angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from angel to angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to be a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While an angel is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can fill any character with a brief and overwhelming sense of compassion and amity.  If timed correctly, the person may follow through on some action they would not have done otherwise, i.e., giving to charity, befriending a lost soul, lending advice.  Using this gift to derive personal benefit is considered a grave sin.  This mastery can force another character out of their True forms (i.e., Horus, TVF, TAF, etc.).  If successful target is filled with compassion, -3 to Attack for duration.<BR>

<B>System/Effect: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> A divination of sorts that harnesses the Light's power to seek out the souls that the angel is sworn to protect.  This mastery would distinguish if a being were a mortal, but not what breed, if any, should the person be discovered to be more than mortal.  Mortal breeds such as Lamia, Psychic, and Ghoul would show to be Mortal, and nothing more.  If the victim is other than a mortal breed (as specified in the previous sentence), the angel will only know they are not mortal, unless they have Level 3 Lore of the victim's breed.  In that case, they will know the breed as well.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I><U><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>       <I>Aurora is 18 years old, and looks like a 13 year old boy, almost.  She is 4'8", 75 pounds, has long brown hair, to her waist that she braids and pulls beneath her baseball cap.  Her eyes are hazel, and have amazingly long lashes, she has a tiny line of freckles that march across a pug nose that seems to fit her tiny features.  She usually wears oversized jeans, a chain connecting her pocket watch to them, and layers design sweatshirts and t-shirts.  She wears no jewelry but a small pendent with the Hebrew symbol for "Alive" around her neck.  She is Isreali, Jewish by birth and proud of her heritage.  She shows no inhibitions, and her parents always warned her that someday her lack of tact would get her in major trouble.  She plays the 'cello very profiently and has just recieved her degree from the Julliard School of Music.  Also, due to a strange happening, she died in a car accident, but remained.  Gifted with the gift on Angeldom.</I><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>       <I>Aurora grew up in Jerusalem.  There at the age of six she had already had two performances broadcasted on Israeli Radio.. She was accepted to the Julliard School of Music at the age of eight and studied in their pre-college program until she had passed all that needed to be done in order to recieve her degree.  Now at the age of 18, she has heard of a Doc. Sinclair that has been directing the orchestra in Ilse Voletta and curious, she has made her way their, with her Stradivarius Cello at her side.</I><BR>
       <BR>
       As of May, 1998, the angel that inhabited the form of Aurora left her, fled the body that was quickly crumbling beneath the responsibility of her position.  She has been restored her mortal form as a punisment from The Light.  Cursed now to walk the earth she blessed before, unable to aid those she turned her back on.<BR>

       In June, 1998, Aurora was bit by BBCH Bear, and made the change to Werewolf, June 10th, 1998<BR>

 </B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

 <B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
