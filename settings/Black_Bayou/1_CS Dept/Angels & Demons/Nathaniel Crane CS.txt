<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>
<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Effect/Description: </B> Gives the demon the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The demon may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The demon may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The demon may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed.<BR>

This gives the demon the ability to understand thoughts and even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The demon may IM the victim and ask 3 questions regarding their deepest, darkest sins.

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When someone begins to show guilt or the potential guilt for committing some act, the demon is capable of suppressing that guilt, enabling the victim to perform the actions without concern for guilt or conscience.  This works on with any one action the victim is performing.  After the act, the victim will be overcome with more intense guilt than they ever realized was possible (should be role-played in the room and posted).</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / see below; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This is the ability to manipulate the dreams of a victim while they are sleeping. The victim will be unaware that they are dreaming and will take the events as fact, until they wake up.  If a dream becomes too horrific (Storyteller discretion), then the victim is allowed a one time roll of 2d6+Mind vs. a target number of 16 to wake up.  Otherwise, the victim will continue to sleep until the dream has ended.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Level 1 ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> The demon is able to control the type of dream a victim is having.

<B>System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Each level purchased grants the demon the ability to create an illusion with an additional sense.  Level 1 is sound, 2 is sight, 3 is smell, 4 is taste, 5 is touch.  A demon can make use of any of the senses he has for a single illusion, i.e., a demon with level 2 could make a fire that could be heard and seen, while one with level three could make a fire that could be heard and seen, as well as smell the wood burning.  At level 5, actual attacks can be made.  This is done using the demon's stats and skills, though a Will roll is still made to see if the illusion is created in the first place and believed.  Damage for the skill used is halved,  (rounded down) and done to the mind, though the target will see their own blood etc.  Unless dispelled by the demon, mindspeak wont break through to someone being effected by an Illusion, however, Hypnotic Suggestion would cancel out the effects.  A round of concentration is required to form the Illusion.  On the next round, the demon sends the Illusion out to be heard, seen, smelled, tasted, or touched.  Many Illusions can be created with this mastery, however, a new roll and another Soul point spent would be in order.    *Note:  If the Illusions effect individuals, then they totally believe in it.  Meaning the Illusions has the ability to affect them physically. For instance, if a demon creates a deafening, high pitched sound, it would hamper or possibly damage the hearing of its victim.  If the demon created a bright flash of light, the victim may be temporarily blinded.  Once the Illusion is over, the victim regains their Mind points, as the effect is over.<BR>

     Nothing more then the slightest emotion weaves and slithers it's way into each and every thought passing through your fragile mind. A fire which has known no restraint consumes your sanity while the final ambers of what was once your consciousness cringe in their deepest darkest corners.<BR>
     It will be quicker then you think, faster then any instinctive reaction you may be hoping will save your precious soul. Once the angel spreads it's wings, it's precious parcel becomes defenseless. It only takes a moment, if that. Too often the fragile soul is being shredded peice-by-peice and confined into it's eternal oblivion before the remnants of the Angel's ministering Light have even had sufficient time to dim.<BR>
     Mine . . . didn't quite work that way.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During my senior year attending St Louis University in late '90, my lovely and charming fiance, Diana and I decided to get married rather than wait until after graduation.  We had a story book romance, the sort that left those around us in awe of the way our personalities melded together so well. When we were around each other it was more like being around a single, complete entity rather then two individuals.  Diana was from an upper middle-class family, as was I.  We grew up knowing the same people in town, attending the same functions, were high school sweethearts of some sort, and graduated from the same class.  You see, we were destined to be a couple, marry, have three wonderful kids and live in a nice neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
I graduated from SLU carrying a degree with honors in Psychology, and several rather large plans.  We pooled money from our wedding and savings, rented a building with a first-floor office and second-floor flat above which we made into a nice little home.  I hung out my shingle, so to speak,  put an add in the phone book and local trade papers and then went to work fixing people's minds. <BR>
<BR>
It didn't take very long. Dysfunctional quickly became my middle name.  I thought I was getting into the mental health profession, but what I didn't realize was that it was subtitled, "Curer of all problems and sole support of everyone's world". Or, at least, that's how my client's felt.  Diana was at my side more then ever now that she was pregnant with our firstborn on it's way.  A good home, a great-paying job, I should have had a stable outlook on life, but nothing I had ever done prepared me for actually being responsible to give these people better lives.  I think my first mistake was in not seeking help. Instead, I began finding things to take my mind off of as much as possible.<BR>
<BR>
It didn't start out as much. At first, it was nothing more then the weekly scratch ticket. Somehow looking forward to those weekly drawings gave me just the distraction I needed. Unfortunately, that didn't work for very long. I decided I had to move my habit up and found some friends who visited the tracks once a week, so I started tagging along. Now, I wasn't like many people. I actually did well enough to usually break even, well, it was even after the nightly drinks. I started at the tracks, but it quickly spilled over to a daily event after work and then a few extra drinks if I had to run an errand for Diana. There were always wrecks someplace or another I'd blame it on. Eventually the alcohol wasn't doing it for me anymore. They say God comes to you in your time of greatest need. Well, I think someone else was taking notes.<BR>
<BR>
I had been working with a Linebacker for the Rams, trying to get him off his Cocaine habit. During our fourth session we talked about going cold turkey and what DT's would be like. He decided he'd check himself into a hospital and left his last vile in my office. I told him I'd get rid of it for him, and he told me I probably saved his career. It was only supposed to be a one time thing, but it worked. For the hours it lasted I had no more problems and for a day and a half later everything seemed a bit easier to deal with. The vial ran out, and I decided I couldn't live without it. A few connections at the track and I was all set.<BR>
<BR>
Trying to juggle the tracks, alcohol, cocaine, and a now struggling psychology practice quickly got out of hand. A new car which conveniently got stolen every so often, a vastly depleted combined life savings, and a drained checking account were trying their hardest, but just weren't keeping up with the bills. Oh, I had plenty of excuses, my competitors hired hackers, bank errors, heh, I'd even blame her for messing up our checking accounts and writing too many checks for cash. I told everyone from my billers, to my wife, to my booker and pusher that clients checks had bounced, but I'd be getting payments soon enough and all the time I had just enough to keep some more bets going, just enough for one more hit, or maybe one last bottle in the desk drawer. By now all of my stress relievers were becoming their own forms of stress. I needed something stronger, and those notes came through again.<BR>
<BR>
Call it bad timing, call it perfect timing, but just when I thought my life was over, I found out my receptionist, who I couldn't really afford anymore, but was so friggin hot that there was no way I was letting her go, was going through a divorce. It really didn't take much persuading at all to decide I should console her . . . on top of my desk . . . at two in the afternoon . . . at least several times a week. Oh, yeah, I had found my new stress relief. But she wouldn't last forever, and I couldn't afford hookers. So, sitting in an alley next to a nightclub, I waited for someone who seemed drunk enough and took advantage of the situation, forcefully. Two weeks. I went two weeks without a single slut knowing who I was, but then I had the misfortune of raping one of my former patients. I knew I couldn't let this new habit get out, and so I did it, I slit her wrists and stuck the jagged piece of metal in her hand.<BR>
<BR>
I can remember waking up in a cold sweat one night. Thinking everything I had done was going to catch up with me. Wondering if I'd walk into my office one day and it'd be all over. But it didn't end that way. Oh, how I wish it had.<BR>
<BR>
My wife was due in a week and we decided she'd go and stay with her parents. I could drive down to the hospital when it was time, but otherwise I needed to focus all my attention on the practice. I never thought I'd hear it, "We need to talk . . .", I thought I had been so good, so sneaky, " . . . I know about the tracks, I know about the secretary, and I know about the cocaine . . ." Even with everything in my life twisting out of control, I always had my anchor, I always had my wife and family, I would always have my . . ., " . . . I don't want my son growing up in this kind of environment. I want a divorce." . . . son.<BR>
<BR>
The hood of that semi is looking pretty good right about now.<BR>
<BR>
Elsewhere, on a spiritual plane, at that precise moment.<BR>
<BR>
"THAT'S IT! I've lost my last soul because of you two baffoons. You, the greatest demon of deception I have ever known, and you refuse to simply tear the living crap out of someone when necessary, and you, probably the most twisted, demented tortures the universe has ever known, but you can't even wait 5 seconds to find out if someone is willing to accept us or not. I've had enough, you two are GOING to get along, and I don't care if it takes you a millennium to do it. Go, no, take over that man's body, and I don't want to see you two down here until you've learned how to coexist."<BR>
<BR>
