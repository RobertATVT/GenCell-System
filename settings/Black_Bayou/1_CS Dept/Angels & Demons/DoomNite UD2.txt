  They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a non-believer.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>
<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>In visual sight of the victim, the demon may cause their hidden desires to manifest to the point that they act upon them.  The priest with a long-hidden penchant for fish net might find himself unable to resist wearing it to 'mass'.  The recovered alcoholic may suddenly fall off the wagon, drinking himself into a stupor.  The victim's Will modifier is at -2 for the duration.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Each level purchased grants the demon the ability to create an illusion with an additional sense.  Level 1 is sound, 2 is sight, 3 is smell, 4 is taste, 5 is touch.  A demon can make use of any of the senses he has for a single illusion, i.e., a demon with level 2 could make a fire that could be heard and seen, while one with level three could make a fire that could be heard and seen, as well as smell the wood burning.  At level 5, actual attacks can be made.  This is done using the demon's stats and skills, though a Will roll is still made to see if the illusion is created in the first place and believed.  Damage for the skill used is halved,  (rounded down) and done to the mind, though the target will see their own blood etc.  Unless dispelled by the demon, mindspeak wont break through to someone being effected by an Illusion, however, Hypnotic Suggestion would cancel out the effects.  A round of concentration is required to form the Illusion.  On the next round, the demon sends the Illusion out to be heard, seen, smelled, tasted, or touched.  Many Illusions can be created with this mastery, however, a new roll and another Soul point spent would be in order.    *Note:  If the Illusions effect individuals, then they totally believe in it.  Meaning the Illusions has the ability to affect them physically. For instance, if a demon creates a deafening, high pitched sound, it would hamper or possibly damage the hearing of its victim.  If the demon created a bright flash of light, the victim may be temporarily blinded.  Once the Illusion is over, the victim regains their Mind points, as the effect is over.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Ken grew up in California, living a fairly normal life until he was about 8. He knew his father was in the local Mafia and this worried him. When he was 8, Ken's father was shot and killed. Before his father died, however, he taught Ken many things, including how to use a gun and how to stand up for yourself. He also taught Ken about revenge. His father's words always stayed clear in his heart. Around the age of 14, Ken joined a local gang, all the while coming closer to his true goal, to kill the Mafia members who slew his father.<BR>
  	Ken quickly grew of rank in the gang, his size intimidating most people as well. Soon he led the gang. Once he was at this stage, he realized something. Most fights he won were not because of strength or power, but because his side was so intimidating that most people were to nervous to fight, thus allowing him to beat on them easier. Now he realizes that he must only engage in hand to hand if desperate.<BR>
  	Ken led the gang for about a year before he disbanded it, the reasons for this being members leaving and rising suspition from the police. He hated to do it, but it needed to be done. He left behind years of selling drugs, but never taking them, gang beatings, and stealing. He still has connections with some of his older friends, and they will do favors for him occasionally, such as getting him money, drugs to sell, and the like.<BR>
  	Ken loves the night and would frequently take walks through the night and watch it's going-ons. One night, he saw a group of people attacking a rival gang. Though he did not like them, he ran to their aid, not liking to see any gang , rival or not, get attacked by a non-gang. As he ran closer, he notices that the non-gang sprouted fangs and were...sucking the gang's blood?? Yes, that's what he saw. He quickly assisted the gang in driving them back, mainly because of the intimidation factor and because the vampires were fairly tired.<BR>
  	After this, and numerous other attacks he witnessed on his walks, he started to study vampires. He studied what they were, why they came to be, what they did, and other similar material. Soon he started tracking them down. It was not long until he decided to move around the country, attempting to rid it of this "infestation." In order to make it seem like he's normal, however, he became a professional hunter(deer, etc.), which helps him a lot, in money, hiding, cover up, and the like.<BR>
  	This infestation was one of the things that brought him to Voletta. He heard it had many vampires, especially a family of them. The only member of it who he knew of, however, was someone by the name of Ann Lee Allen(Now Ann Lee Allen-Martel), someone who he had grown up with. He also heard it had a fairly decent forest to hunt in. Lastly, he was looking for a change of scenery.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
