<BR>
Please Keep this Letter for your records.  You have a wonderful background and SL behind your character.  I am very impressed by the work you've put into the historical aspects of Matilda - I applaud the good job you've done.  You have the approval for the Age of your character and it is noted that you are coming into the game as a Mortal.  Please contact me if you wish to do anything with Raziel as an NPC in any plotlines that you have come up.  I would be more than happy to help you with any future SLs that stem from the relationship between the princess and her 'guardian  angel.' :) <BR>
<BR>
A copy of your SL approval has been sent to the Background Dept. and Angel/Demon Breed Department.  You should be hearing back from the BG Dept. about your BG submission and should soon be on your way to getting that approved as well. <BR>
<BR>
Any logs or posts that you put up concerning your SL should be linked or posted in the Mind Vault - Post Link folder so we can keep track of the A&B points that you will accumulate for this SL.  Here is a link to how logs and posts should be posted in that folder.  <A HREF="aol://5863:126/mB:444965:1">Welcome to The Mind Vault - Post Links!</A><BR>
<BR>
I hope you have a wonderful time with this SL.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. <BR>
<BR>
Thank You.<BR>

1) Title of Storyline</I>  Lacking Grace.<I><BR>
<BR>
2) Players involved (screen and character names)</I>  <BR>
<BR>
Matilda Braganza (Matilda Bragan)<BR>
And any others over time that she might meet<I><BR>
<BR>
3) Summary (what you want to happen)</I>  <BR>
<BR>
This SL is my request to allow Matilda the age of 200 years old.  I know that two hundred years is a very long time, and that she would be very, very old as far as Black Bayou goes, but for the purposes of the Background and history that I have organized and painstakingly fleshed out, those 200 years are necessary.  Note, also, that upon arrival in Voletta, Matilda would be an ordinary mortal, with an ordinary Character Sheet, unaffected by the two hundred years she had lived before then. <I><BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)</I><BR>
<I><BR>
	</I>I can send you the prepared BG, if you like.  I thought it'd be overkill to attach it to the SL (all of it, it's long) and then resubmit it to the BG department.  The basic idea is that Matilda was once angel, and has fallen, and is now an ordinary human, with not-so-ordinary knowledge about God.  If you need to see the BG now, let me know, please.<I><BR>
