3) Summary (what you want to happen) The main goal of this SL is to allow Nova to become an angel.<BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen) <BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Nova pulls away from all the social aspects of her life:  Family, friends and lovers.  She keeps herself at Michael's apartment in a small room, only coming out to feed and go to St Michael's to pray.<BR>
A week after this starts, the Blessed Virgin at St Michael's begins shedding blood tears.  Nova finds out about this and begins attending nightly to pray to the Statue.  She prays all night and leaves one hour before sunrise to return to Michael's home.  She will not tell anyone what she is praying for.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Then suddenly one night, Nova receives the stigmata to the hands while praying.  She passes out from loss of blood and is rushed to the hospital where Michael treats her.  The next day, when the wounds are healed, a scar is left on both sides of the hands.  The scars resemble crosses.  All she will say for forty-eight hours is "She is crying for us."  Needless to say, she is kept on watch for a week at the hospital.<BR>
During this time a person from the Vatican comes to visit her.  Nova begins talking of Fra Angelico (Patron Saint of Art) speaking to her, telling her things she is to do.  She begs the Vatican Official to take her to Vatican City, that there is much work to be done. <BR>
He allows her to go and there she prays in the Sistine Chapel for four nights.  On the fifth night the ground shakes with tremors and there is a panic.  Nova calls Michael, telling him that he must come to help her.  When he arrives the next evening, he is told that Nova is once again in the Sistine Chapel praying.  He finds her bleeding from her feet and hands.  She has received the second stigmata.  <BR>
He quickly treats her and stops the bleeding, knowing that the wounds will be healed the next day.  The scars on her hands return.  He also finds that she has been given some sort of epiphany and she is determined to "find something that has been lost."<BR>
She convinces the Vatican Official and Michael to travel with her to look for an object she will not reveal the nature of.  The then begin moving from one Cathedral to the next.  From country to country each week:  Canterbury, Notre Dam, Strasbourg, and Orvieto.  At each of these, the search at night for something.  The catch is that none of them really know what they are looking for.  Nova assures them that Saint Angelico will tell her when they find it.<BR>
At the cathedral in Orvieto, Nova falls in front of the a statue of Fra Angelico, she is bleeding from the head.  They soon realize that this is the third stigmata.  Once recovered, Nova instructs them to buy the statue and break the saw the head off of it.<BR>
They find inside a bible with a golden covered, embellished with jewels and seven thorns, the exact number of wounds Nova had on her head.  This bible dates back to the twelfth century, but inside there is an amazing discovery.  Inside the title page says The Altar Bible of St. Michael's, Isle Voletta.  On further examination, the Last Judgment comes and Isle Voletta is the first to be purged of the sinners.  It also prophesied the coming of two angels that would come to find this Bible and take it to it's rightful home.<BR>
The three return to the Vatican for an evening, but Nova will not rest.  She is hysterical to get back home to Voletta and to give the Altar Bible to Angus.  So the next evening, with much advice from Michael, the three return to Louisiana and to Isle Voletta.  Nova rushes to give the Bible to Angus.<BR>
<BR>
The night after they return, Nova goes to pray to the crying Madonna.  She is tired and confused.  As she is praying she receives the fourth stigmata and begins bleeding from the side.  She is, once again, rushed to the hospital, but they are unable to stop the bleeding.  Michael is called in but before he can rush to help, there is a blinding light in the ER and all the lights in the hospital fade off and on a moment.  When Michael gets into the operating room, he finds Nova awake, sitting up and pulling the IVs out of her arm.  But she is no longer a vampire, as she will confide, she is an angel.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>
