<BR>
Please Keep this Letter for your records.  This SL is being playtested with an NPC Demon Spirit.  Please contact me when you would like to set up times to have a member of the Storyline or ST Dept be available to play your demon friend. <g>   <BR>
<BR>
Please note:  I don't want you to feel as if you -have- to play with the NPC at all times - you of course may play your character at anytime.  Optemis is only to help you flesh out your storyline - not to be a controlling factor in your RP. <g> <BR>

The NPC will not be able to effect anyone in the game other than your character. <BR>

SL : Sidney's Demon<BR>
Submitted by Ivlorbid Dreams<BR>
NPC : Optemis SL 	<BR>
<BR>
Optemis never had a nice life; when he was mortal that is. People back stabbed him and angered him quite often. Soon he used his magic, that he had inherited and developed, to strike back at those who had hurt him. Not after long, the "Dark Forces" learned of him... They send another Demon to bring him to the Underworld.<BR>
	Soon after he arrived, he met with the Dark Father. He asked him if he enjoyed to hurt those who hurt him, and of course Optemis replied with a "yes". He liked to make it slow, and painful. An eye for an eye was what he lived for; and whatever it was that had hurt him, he would make it ten times worse. <BR>
	The Dark Father "blessed" him, and he lived for the next 100 years in the Underworld. [In reality, that wasn't nearly as long as Earth days. Hell's time goes faster than the Underworld's time.] The treatment he received hardened him, made him almost completely emotionless. The way that the Dark Father wanted him. The Dark Father was not satisfied with him wandering the shadows, slaughtering anyone who cast him a glance. <BR>
	Then Marcus arrived, and told the Dark Father [who had a close connection with] that his daughter Sidney was young enough to corrupt, and not confuse at the same time. The Dark Father took this oppurtunity to test Optemis' understanding of what kind of Demon he was, what was expected of him. The best way to do this was to make him teach and ready another under his ways. Sidney.<BR>
	By the time Sidney was assigned the anti-guardian angel Optemis, she was almost 14. He came to her at night, moving through the shadows which he so loved. He gave her the instructions; and from that point on he would "teach" her the ways of a Revenge Demon. Sometimes, just for fun, he would haunt her dreams with vivid and morbid scenes of some of his victims' deaths. He had a sick obsession with how many he could kill - it was almost as if he were bragging.<BR>
