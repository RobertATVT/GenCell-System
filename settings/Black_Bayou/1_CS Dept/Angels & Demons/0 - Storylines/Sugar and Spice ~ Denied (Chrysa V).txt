</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>1) Title of Storyline : </I>Sugar and Spice<I><BR>
<BR>
2) Players involved (screen and character names) : </I>Chrysa D'Marou (Chrysa V)<I><BR>
<BR>
3) Summary (what you want to happen) :  </I>Having been all but run out of Voletta prior to completing her business there, Chrysa has determined to find a way by which to return and remain unmolested by the towns occupants long enough to complete her plans and perhaps take vengeance upon a few remaining adversaries.  To this end, she has began searching for a means by which to hide her true self for a time.<I><BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen) : </I>The best option that has occurred to the little demon while investigating the varied possibilities is the temporary possession of another human body.  (chosen npc)  To accomplish this she will make a bargain with the lord of darkness.  In exchange for the corruption of three souls per month she will be allowed to transfer her essence into the body of another and utilize said body until she either grows tired of such or fails to supply the neccessary payment.  In order to assure herself a constant supply of victims, Chrysa will have herself enrolled in one of the countries most prominent private schools for girls.  Once there she will begin her efforts to corrupt the students.  Initially patient it may take her some time (an indeterminate number of posts) to fully corrupt the first three sacrifices, however, once accomplished she will pick up her pace and continue to insure the damnation of these innocents until such time as she loses interest or runs out of victims, whichever comes first.  When the demons essence finally does leave its new host, the original individual will have no memory of what has happened to her, though the occasional nightmare may hint at the atrocities she has committed. (Thus making her a potential future source of conflict)(While in the new body I would request permission to play this character under a different sn in order to assure a minimal amount of ooc interference from those who may not be capable of separating player and character knowledge)<BR>
