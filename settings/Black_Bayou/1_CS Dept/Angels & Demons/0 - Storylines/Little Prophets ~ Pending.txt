It was a thought of mine to incorporate all angels in your SL for being able to see this glow you have mentioned.  Let me know if this would be a viable option for what you are wanting to achieve with this SL.  (Anais also being included in this visual image of yours.)   If you wanted to go with the game wide effect of having others who aren't of the Angel Breed to see your effects then I'd suggest the SFX ability as was mentioned before.   Whereas I understand that this glow isn't a special effect -- by using the ability like a special effect -- you would be able to allow others to see the fingertip glow without getting their consent to participate in your SL. <BR>
<BR>
Confusing?  Yes, I'm sure it is. But other than this single stumbling block I see no reason why not to approve your submission.  Please contact me back so we can iron out the details. <BR>

3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Raziel is an angel.  He has always been an angel, since the beginning of time.  And throughout history, angels have been joining with special humans to form an Earth-bound equivalent- a little piece of the Light, among the mortals.  Raziel has joined with two humans in his time, both failures, unfortunately, who fell from grace, hurtling him back up to heaven.  His first host was a young nun named Anais Tovi, with whom he spent the better half of the seventeenth century, and the eighteenth century, before she fell.  After Anais, Raziel moped around for a few years, before he decided to join with a ten year old princess of Portugal, Matilda Braganza.  Matilda and Raziel were a divine force to be reckoned with for nearly two hundred years, and then she fell as well.  And now Raziel is rather broken.  I've heard it said that light can fragment- shatter into all sorts of colours like broken glass, only impenetrable.  Not long ago, a small piece of what makes Raziel shine so brightly got caught in the vampire now known as Anais Tovi- just a little shard, that had been growing, and causing quite a stir inside the vampire's psyche, and soul (for details, see the SL titled Bliss, approved by HOST ANT Aradia 1/26/00).<BR>
	Former angels rarely meet.  And when they do, they rarely know the past they've both shared.  But Raziel's quiet presence inside Anais was not lost to Matilda, the first time the two of them met.  Anais is something special, even without that angel, and it dawned on Matilda suddenly that she was heartbreakingly normal, and unable to help anyone in her current, mortal state.  Raziel saw this, knew this, and has decided to make Matilda something other than normal.<BR>
	You see, that bit of light inside Anais has been split.  It had two choices- either take control of Anais' soul, and join with her to form a full fledged angel once again, or disperce, and leave her to her vampiric fate.  Well, Raziel chose to break off another piece of himself, and deposite it inside Matilda.  Only a small piece- if piece is even the right word for it -something shining and perfect that's locked now in her soul for all time, and not leaving.<BR>
	This has been done before, this blessing of light upon mortals.  It happened to Noah, and it happened to Moses; it happened to Isaiah, and Ezekiel, and Muhammad.  They were called prophets.  They were mortals- pure mortals, unexceptional in the world- until the day that the Light blessed them with this unique gift.  Some say they spoke to God, some say they made miracles with God's Light, but the true angels know that they simply held a piece of faith inside them- sparkling, dully.  And, occasionally, that light has manifested itself in the knowledge of the divine, or in some unexplanable performance of amazement.<BR>
	Matilda will be the next prophet- Voletta's prophet, if you will.  She will be approached by Raziel (all in a series of posts, mind you), and given the gift of divine sight, to see a person in his most honest light (a gift I intend to roleplay only after acquiring any given mun's permission), and the ability to shine dully around the tips of her fingers upon occasion (when trying to instill belief).  All this I intend to thoroughly explain in an upcoming series of posts.<BR>
