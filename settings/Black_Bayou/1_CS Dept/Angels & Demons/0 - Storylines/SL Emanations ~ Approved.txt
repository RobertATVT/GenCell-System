<BR>
Please Keep this Letter for your records. First, I want to thank you for your patience in allowing me to gather up all the approvals for your submission. I'm sorry it took so long. <BR>
<BR>
The Emanations feeling will be exactly that.  Any of the approved players that come within a 15 foot distance of you will begin to show the signs of what you have listed out as below.  Please note : this is -not- a sight based aura that is around Damian, but rather an odd feeling that the players will get when around you in the specified area. <BR>
<BR>
Any logs or posts that you put up concerning your SL should be linked or posted in the Mind Vault - Post Link folder so we can keep track of the A&B points that you will accumulate for this SL.  Here is a link to how logs and posts should be posted in that folder.  <A HREF="aol://5863:126/mB:444965:1">Welcome to The Mind Vault - Post Links!</A><BR>
<BR>
I hope you have a wonderful time with this SL.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. <BR>
<BR>
Thank You.<BR>

<BR>
3) Summary (what you want to happen): Basically I have recently bought Damian 10 levels of Faith.  The fact remains, that this is a lot of Faith for any character in the game.  When Damian comes close to Demons or Angels, say within conversational distance, they can begin to 'sense' or 'feel' the Faith that resonates around him, like an invisible aura.  This really has no game affect other than for RP purposes.  How each individual reacts is up to the player, but it should at least be noticed.  I have met some resistance to this minor affect and wanted to incorporate it for an interesting RP possibility.<BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen): Just by Damian possessing this amount of Faith, I want to let all the demons and angels able to respond.  I have already purchased the Faith and wanted to have this little side affect approved.<BR>
