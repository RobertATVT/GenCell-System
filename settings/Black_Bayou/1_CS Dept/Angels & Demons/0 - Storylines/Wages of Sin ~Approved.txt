</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>3) Summary:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Tonio Cortano is both a descendent of Tobi and her latest angelic mission, as has been explained in both her approved background and in recent posts. Tobi has been attempting to save Tonio's rather sinful soul while dodging none other than the Devil himself, Lucifer, and his own efforts upon Tonio. In an attempt to thwart Tobi, Lucifer has cursed her with a reoccurring stigmata and continues to draw Tonio deeper into eternal darkness with the aid of Layne Harken, a demon of the first degree. <BR>
	Emma Thayne is a deaf vampire of the Chappys who happens to be Tonio's true soul mate, for lack of a better word. Tobi knows this and will be approaching Emma in hopes that by introducing her to Tonio, Emma will help heal some of Tonio's inner wounds. Upon realizing that Tobi's effort is slowly working, Layne will strip Emma of her vampirism and thereby her mindspeech ability out of spite; consequently, Emma becomes mortal again and loses her only means of communication with the world at large. Unfortunatly, Tonio is on the angel of death's-  Aida Falak's -"to-do" list and will not quite be what one might call pristine as of then and very much leant to the darker side of things 'cause, to be frank, his list of sins is rather extensive. Brennan Daniels, being a good friend of Emma's, will have the choice of intervening on Tonio's behalf for Emma's sake; and that can lead to possible conflict between Aida and the archangel. <BR>
	One way or another, a sort of bargain or exchange will be made seeing as how Aida, playing the righteous figure that she will be, will not be very willing to wait for Tobi to suceed in cleansing Tonio's soul before taking him into death. Also, Emma will be mortal <I>and </I>deaf and heaven won't be entirely too pleased with Tobi's possible failure. Not to mention that Tobi will still be plagued by the stigmata. Eventually, either Tonio will end up giving his life in exchange for Emma earning the sense of hearing and go to heaven for that heroic action; or Brennan might be able to convince Aida to wait; or Tobi might be able to strike up some seperate bargain with either Aida and/or Layne; or.. who knows? The conclusion to this SL will all depend upon the actions of the characters involved and the imaginations of us muns. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>4) Generalized Direction:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I><BR>
	<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>We fully plan on using only role play and posts to carry out this SL and do not wish to use any rolls unless it becomes absolutely necessary; and even then, at a minimum. What we want to definitely happen is Emma to become mortal by the wrath of Lucifer (via Layne) and if it happens that the bargain for the exchange of Tonio's death for Emma's hearing is struck- Emma will earn the sense of hearing. Also, by some means or another that will only come to light through the playing out of this SL, Tobi will eventually be relieved of the stigmata curse.<BR>
	Finally, Emma's CS is currently inactive. Would it be best for her mun to either a) reactivate it and then make the breed change at the proper time in the SL, or b) simply go about regenerating Emma as a mortal?<BR>

<B>Role within the SL</B> ~  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0">Okay- hrm.  Emma here is supposed to be the NPC Tonio's "soulmate", as it were, and through her, he will realize the error of his ways, and begin to battle against Lucifer (or is it Layne, now?) for possession of his immortal soul.  Emma is also a viable way of dragging the archangel Brennan (Ariel) into the SL, since he is one of her closest friends.  For her meddling in the affairs of Tobi and Tonio, Lucifer/Layne will strip Emma of her vampirism, and thus her ability to Mindspeak, which she has mastered as a means of communication since she is deaf/mute.  In the end, she may regain her hearing through some act of heroism on Tonio's part before he dies, but that has yet to be determined, since we have decided to leave it up to the roleplay.  <BR>
