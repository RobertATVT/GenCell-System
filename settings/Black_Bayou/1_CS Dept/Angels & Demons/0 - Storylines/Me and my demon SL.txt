4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)<BR>
I'm gonna send this little thingee in and you're gonna approve it, so I Can send in my BG, so I can send in my CS, so I can play this character.<BR>
<BR>
Once Jack is in Voletta he's gonna team up with the other demons to wipe out the angels. He's gonna acquire favors and try to sway people to his brand of thinking. He's not a demon of seducation, he's a demon of compromise. He will make people compromise. He will get them to agree with him. He will aquire favors and do things for people. Basically he'll corrupt until he dies.<BR>
