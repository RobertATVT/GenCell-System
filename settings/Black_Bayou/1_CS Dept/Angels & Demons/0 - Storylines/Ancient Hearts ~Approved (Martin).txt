	Thank you both for your timely response to my inquiries. I've spoken to HostAntParadox and he does confirm that a demon slot is available. I've also confirmed that Tana-mun does meet all the requirements for gen-ing as a vampire. This option is also available for Martin-mun if he so chooses, though he has stated that he does not wish to go that rout.<BR>
	This is to be a one time SL and it seems sound enough for me. You are limted to the power of your CS's and the power of your role playing abilities. These seem, to me, the only requirements that need to be introduced and you'll be the determinate of that. As the old saying goes, if you don't have it don't use it. I don't think I need to say anymore there.<BR>
	Therefore, with much fan fare and applauds. I'm happy to announce the approval of your SL. Please keep a copy of this for your records and forwards a copy, along with your BG, to the background dept.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your patience and your submission,<BR>

The Ancient Hearts storyline is being submitted to allow Martin and Tana to get ancient backgrounds (500 yrs plus)  approved for character generation.  Host Ant Coma requested a SL submission before allowing character's to come in at the ancient age that Tana and Martin both are. <BR>
Martin begins his Background as a Lamia of noteworthy power and respect on the small island of Thera in 1600+ BC (This island is what is believed to have once held the lost civilization that is the fabled Atlantis).  After he meets Tana in the forum (all in their BGs) they become great friends... after sometime she "dies", this is actually the death as a resolution of her becoming a Vampire but in the course of all this Martin begins to dwell in Dark Powers to save her as she is dying and unleashes the Spell Tremors when she does in fact die and he can do nothing about it.  The island becomes unstable and all heck is breaking loose so he grabs her body and flees.  Once he turned his back on his order and his way of life and turned to the Darker side of his art he falls as a Lamia and once again becomes a mortal.  This is where they begin in Black Bayou...  <BR>
<BR>
I believe the reason that you cannot play an ancient character is because it is not feasible to have someone that old and be a total wuss that can easily be wiped out by another new CS...  but for that purpose the two characters will post their history through the ages as things change, as Martin Becomes a Demon and they wreak havoc through time.  The idea for the characters is to post until they can "come" into Voletta and walk amongst those young sparks and what not.<BR>

Martin and Tana will begin their Time posting and do so for a number of  months<BR>
Martin will become a demon after the first month of play which will be posted through and played out in post threads.  Tana and Martin will have a ball throughout time <g><BR>
