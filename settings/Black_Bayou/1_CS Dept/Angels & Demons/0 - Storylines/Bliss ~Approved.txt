<BR>
Please Keep this Letter for your records.<BR>
<BR>
Since the character </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Asrai N'Guyen/Raziel was a previous character of yours and you know for certain that she won't be coming back, I'll go ahead and approve this SL. Have loads of fun writing and RPing out the personality battles and please don't hesitate to contact me if you need any assistance. <BR>

1) Title of Storyline</I>: Bliss.<I><BR>
 <BR>
 2) Players involved (screen and character names)</I>: Anais Tovi (AnTsolais); Asrai N'Guyen/Raziel (no longer existant in PC capacity).<I><BR>
 <BR>
 3) Summary (what you want to happen): </I>I am operating on the assumption that the Vampire is somehow also Fallen. Legend after legend calls them this. I have one, in fact, that says they are fallen angels. There must be some atonement, no? <BR>
 	Raziel - Asrai - somehow gets inside Anais, or a little piece does, and stays. It's the most impossibley slow ascension, while Raziel grows - effectively, incubated. And Ani starts to look a little crazy, saying she can see things she can't and saying she can't see things she should be able to. We all know Freud's tiger and bureau example - her bureau is sometimes a tiger, and there is no reconciling that fact. And in the end, she finally becomes an angel...and then the question is whether she's still crazy, or whether she was ever crazy at all.<I><BR>
 <BR>
 4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)</I>: Well, she always had a tendancy for that sort of thing. In the course of her life, she's been "posessed" (they said) at least once. She was a nun; when she left the convent, they said something had "gotten inside her." I haven't quite decided what I mean by that yet, but this time an Angel has gotten inside her. And for one reason or another, decides she's worth "saving". It's rather like multiple personality disorder when it first starts. And I assume this will take over a month, for the entire angel'ing. Impossibley slow, we said.<I><BR>
