3) Summary (what you want to happen)  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>The DeRoy Corporation, owned and operated by Leroy DeRoy has been re-headquartered in LA by none other than Memnoch Berovichi himself (As stated in the Character BG).  The DeRoy Corporation of three different companies and one underground network.  The first is, obviously, The DeRoy Corp.  This makes up the Business Body of the DeRoy empire (Description Given Below).  The second is the Robinson Media Group.  This consists of a manufacturing plant (making Media Components and located in Arizona), a local broadcast station WKBS and a small and an almost disused Television Studio (Satellite dish also in orbit). The Robinson Media group is officially owned by a one "Dion Michaels".  The third part of the DeRoy company is Nomex Research Foundation.  Based on the mainland, the research complex does studies on Human Behaviors and Genetics. This is officially owned by "Jeffry Robinson"  The last part of the DeRoy Corp. is not officially tied to the Corporation itself.  The Company, known as Nomed Weapons, is officially owned under the name "Edward Barkas".  The company itself makes low cost, high powered weaponry for the United States Army.  Just like the US Army's Motto goes: "Remember soldier, your weapons were made by the lowest bidder.".  Nomed Weapons, Inc is not actually located in LA at all.  It's location remains in Utah. <BR>

4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Below is a description of each company and it's main workers. <BR>
<BR>
	<B>The DeRoy Corporation</B>  <BR>
	<I>President and CEO: Leroy DeRoy (Leroy DeRoy)<BR>
	Legal Representation: Wan Tseng Androvich (Tseng Zhu Wan)<BR>
	Co-Heads of Security: Cody Vereda (Cody Vereda), Roland Deschain (RolndDschn)<BR>
	Public Relations:  Malcolm McVey (MalcMcVey)<BR>
	Computer Expert: Chris Lederman (SycoFrogg)</I><BR>
	Description:   The DeRoy Corporation is the flagship of the DeRoy Business Empire.  The Corporate headquarters, formally based in Minnesota, has been moved to the Isle mainland at the prompting of Memnoch Berovichi.  <BR>
	A regular looking office building, the DeRoy Corporate building is located on the mainland. The name DeROY is displayed in bright red lettering across the front of the building.  The parking lot, a three story ramped structure, is controlled and patrolled by the DeRoy security force.  Both regular and covert cameras cover the entire area. A car wishing to enter the lot would first has to stop at the Security check point which is manned by the Security Guard Otis Bondsworth (NPC).  After the person(s) in the car had provided Otis with proper picture ID (ie. a DeRoy security pass) as well as statement of Business (work orders, appointments, etc) before the gates would be opened and the car would be allowed to pass and park.  <BR>
	Upon crossing the lot and entering the large revolving door the entering person would be met by a security/information desk a large open hallway.   During all hours the building is open, the security desk is manned by Barney Shepherd (NPC) whom is informed of all peoples entering the building, what they're there for and if any extra measures should be taken. Before being allowed to enter the lobby, the person is required to go through a metal detector.  Refusal to do so will result in the police being called to the scene for immediate assistance. The open lobby is luxurious in every sense of the word.  Marble flooring upon immediate entry followed by carpeting in the main area.  Immediately forward is a group of four elevators.  To the left, a cluster of pay phones, a small Bar and Occult Coffee and Book shop. To the right, the restrooms, an information center as well as several small gift shops and the stairs going to floors 2,3,4 and 5.  The building itself has 8 floors. <BR>
	The lobby makes up floor 1.  Floor 2 is used as a storage area and is not accessible without the use of a Level 2 Security Pass (Security Passes being issued via E-mail by myself and required to be input into an elevator or door card slot).  Floor 3, 4 and 5 contain the work areas.  Cubicles and Computers, etc.  A security guard station lies in each room as well as near the elevators.  Each room has a visible camera presence as well as an invisible one cover the entire building's exterior, roof and interior (each room).  This is fed to the security level as well as Leroy DeRoy's private penthouse.  Floor 6 is the executive level where board meetings, product testing and business deals are carried out.  For this reason, Level 3 Security is required to enter the level.  Floor 7 is the Security level where all video feeds from the cameras, notifications of VIP Arrivals and other such security matters are relayed.  For this reason, a Level 4 security pass is required to enter the level while a level 5 security pass is required to access the AV room. In the AV room, the camera feeds are sent to monitors and to the mainframe disk where they are stored for future usage.  Floor 8 is Leroy DeRoy's private penthouse and requires a level 5 security pass.  <BR>
	The Security of the building is as follows.  Cameras (both regular and pinhole) utilizing both Audio and Video components cover the entire building both exterior and interior.  Each employee of the company is issued a level 1 security pass which grants them access to the building for regular work days and other such needed things.  At least two members of the NPC security force oversee any maintenance or clean up crews to the Storage area and respective work areas day or night.  Security desks (at least one on each level) are all equipt with security monitors for the respective levels as well as an internal/external phone, internal panic button (which will alert both the SD and the building security) and computer from intranet access can be achieved.  During working hours, the security desks are manned throughout the day and during non-working hours, one on each level is manned while security personnel patrol each "non-secure" level.  When the working day ends, the building is locked up and security guards patrol each floor. In the event that an employee requires late night access, two security guards would accompany that emplyee to their work station and stay with them until such time as they are finished, whereupon they would be escorted out.  Security pass allocations works as:<BR>
	Regular Employees- Level 1 Security <BR>
	Janitors and Maintenance Crew- Level 2 Security <BR>
	Executives- Level 3 Security <BR>
	Regular Security Personnel- Level 4 Security<BR>
	Heads of Security- Level 5 Security<BR>
	Board Members and CEO- Level 5 Security <BR>
Should it be required, the building may go into a lock down mode.  This means that each door and window would be not only locked but an electrical current would pass through them and shock anyone who would attempt to break it open (-1 Body).  In addition to this, the elevators are stopped and the elevator doors sealed.<BR>
<BR>
The Company itself it privately owned and no shares are made available to the public. <BR>
	As a side note, in Mister DeRoy's private penthouse located in the Corporate building, is a secret room which contains a personal viewing suite of the complex as well as helping to keep tabs on the various employees in and sometimes out of the building.  Only Leroy knows of the room and only he has the keys for the room. <BR>
