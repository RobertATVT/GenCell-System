As soon as he re-approves your Angel BC then I'll be able to get this SL renewed for you . :)  <BR>

Contact me if you have any questions.  <BR>

1) Title of Storyline: Bliss.<BR>
 <BR>
 2) Players involved (screen and character names): Anais Tovi (AnTsolais); Asrai N'Guyen/Raziel (no longer existant in PC capacity); Matilda Bragan(Matilda Bragan).<BR>
 <BR>
 3) Summary (what you want to happen): I am operating on the assumption that the Vampire is somehow also Fallen. Legend after legend calls them this. I have one, in fact, that says they are fallen angels. There must be some atonement, no? <BR>
    Raziel - Asrai - somehow gets inside Anais, or a little piece does, and stays. It's the most impossibley slow ascension, while Raziel grows - effectively, incubated. And Ani starts to look a little crazy, saying she can see things she can't and saying she can't see things she should be able to. We all know Freud's tiger and bureau example - her bureau is sometimes a tiger, and there is no reconciling that fact. The question is whether she's still crazy, or whether she was ever crazy at all.<BR>
    Complicating matters, however, is the presence of a girl named Matilda who believes (and is in fact very right) that the angel in Anais is hers. Right before Ani is to finally ascend, she reaches out and touches someone (er...Tilda), thusly passing approximately half of her angel to the girl she stole it from in the first place. Voila. Prophetess and a half. <BR>
 <BR>
 4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen): Well, she always had a tendancy for that sort of thing. In the course of her life, she's been "posessed" (they said) at least once. She was a nun; when she left the<BR>
convent, they said something had "gotten inside her." I haven't quite decided what I mean by that yet, but this time an Angel has gotten inside her. And for one reason or another, decides she's worth "saving". It's rather like multiple personality disorder when it first starts. <BR>
    We said before she was going to have the most impossibly slow ascension ever. This is to be slightly altered, by feeling and circumstance...the angel, part of it, the belief, the insanity - whatever - is to be given to Matilda Bragan. Because this soul belongs to Matilda as much as it belongs to Ani. <BR>
    The result is this: no change in power (on CS's); no change in appearance. Not for either character. This, we think, is just inspiration. It provides them with more insight - nothing that can really be planned on; it's just a certain air of spirituality. A glow; a literal one, in Matilda's case. It's really more up to the mun's we play with, how Tilda's and Ani's comments<BR>
