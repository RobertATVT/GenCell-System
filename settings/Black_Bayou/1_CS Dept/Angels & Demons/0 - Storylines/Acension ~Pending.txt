<BR>
There are some things that I need you to do before approving the SL.  <g>  I understand that you have been waiting some time to get this plot line off and running, so the sooner I hear back from you the sooner we'll get your SL set up. : ) <BR>
<BR>
First off, I want to tell you I like the creativity you've put into your submission.  Good work, I look forward to reading the posts that come from all of this.  <BR>
<BR>
Now.. some things that you will need to change before I can approve this.  One, you are going to have to remove Laz from the storyline.  I am not going to be able to approve this part of the plot line.  After much discussion with members of the SL Dept and  Breed Dept, I have come to the conclusion that this boarders too close to character manipulation.  I am afraid that removing Wan from her demon spot to then move Laz into that same position would be unfair, I can't in good faith approve this.<BR>
<BR>
Two, I can't approve the appearance change you described with Michaela Luciano or the Zara Romni body switch.  There's not any problem with the lost memories you detailed out,  I certainly agree that once the fall takes place that you have just cause to wipe out some or all of the memories you choose to ignore.<BR>
<BR>
I just want to verify with you, that we're on the same wave length. ::winks::  This character was gen'd Psychic, then went Vampire, then went to Demon.  Is that right?<BR>
<BR>
Please get back with me as soon as you can so we can get you on the road to approval. <g>  Thanks bunches.<BR>

Okies... here is what I have planned so far... but first some background on this three year old demon....<BR>
<BR>
1) She was genned psychic... <weg> as Michaela Luciano, biological niece to Remy Thorne.<BR>
2)  She represented Alexander Landermont and Memmoch as their attorney<this was when she was a vamp.. except for Landermont when she was psychic><BR>
3)  Vamped by Aylyai<BR>
4)  Killed by Geoff and James Bamf when she went demon.<BR>
5)  Created as a demon, as the name of Sonja Raiden...  one of Zion's failed experiments where her host body was destroyed and the demon took over one, Zara Romni.<BR>
6)  Zara Romni's body was freed of the demon, though during the act, the host died, just leaving the shell.  The Lamia who performed the ritual, took the shell so it is never said what happened to it.<BR>
<BR>
Now to what I want to do....  <BR>
<BR>
Wan/Naamah is getting tired of the mortal world.  Almost as old as Memnoch, she feels it is time to retire and just live the rest of her existence in her own private hell.  Now, as she finally gives herself completely to The Dark  During this.. she convers with the demon lord of Voletta.. Malcolm McVey.. and after stating her position, leaves with his permission. In return, through an SL that I am trying to work up with my other character of Lazarus, who would be sent by Lai'charon's father ... as Asmodeus is the son of Naamah and his General.. to watch over his daughter.. though she is a demon lord... a little backup is not bad.  Especially with a demon that is geared toward leading a military attack... this is where the SL for Laz to become Demon will start<titled Ascension II>  During this, the following can happen...<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>1)  Wan, as the host body was evil to begin with, distingerates<sp> and the form of Michaela Luciano is once more restored in her original form... blonde hair, green eyes...  and once more a psychic.  It is from there that she loses all memory of her past three years.  All she remembers is that she is Remy's niece, that she defended Alex Landermont and knows of Cameron and Cat.. but thinks they are still with the PD or SD.. have to look that up.  Other than that.. she knows nothing.<BR>
<BR>
2)  Now when Zara became Wan.. it was stated in the post that the Lamia who did the switch, took the remaining shell of Zara Romni... the shell was never destroyed....  This form could be used.... Zara was mortal before she became demon....  so... she can return to this form as a mortal..... Memories of up to Zara remembered.. which is... that she was in love with a Simon Trent... nothing about being demon or who  is demon.<BR>
<BR>
3) Eh...  Wan goes mortal and keeps her memories...or psychic and no memories except of her past in San Francisco.. not even knowing why she is in Voletta<BR>
<BR>
Though I think that one of the first two.. especially the second idea would be interesting and different.<BR>
