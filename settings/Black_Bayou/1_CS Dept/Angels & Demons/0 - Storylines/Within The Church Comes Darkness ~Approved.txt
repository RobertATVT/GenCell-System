<BR>
<B>2) Players Involved: </B>Deimin Vash - Deimin Vash<BR>
<BR>
<B>3) Summary:</B> Deimin has always had the luck of finding trouble.  Deimin was attending college when his first run in with the dark happenings of the world came into his life.  Deimin was seduced by a woman going by the name Alexa, she seduced him to leave with her to Russia.  Once arriving in Russia with this mistress of seduction Deimin found himself bonded to this seductress through blood.  Through later learnings Deimin learned that she was what was known as a vampire; and he, her ghoul.  <BR>
	Deimin's second run in with the dark side of the world came after arriving in Voletta.  There was a man at the time known as Cait (Cait Sith I believe, fuzzy mind now) who had the ability to play in Deimin's mind.  Deimin believed him to be that of the vampiric nature as that was all he knew.  (Had lore 3 vampire at the time)  This man tortured and tormented Deimin simply by speaking in his mind, like that of his previous seductress.<BR>
	Deimin's third run in with the dark world was the one that brought him to the night.  A vampire attacked him in an ally, forcing Deimin to feed from him and make him a chylde of the night.  At that same time two vampires were witness to these happenings and rushed in to make an attack.  They took the vampire and Deimin to a warehouse where Deimin's attacker and sire was murderd by Aylyai.  Deimin was left locked up to die and rise again.  <BR>
	Deimin was left as an abandoned chylde, his fourth run in with the dark world was when Evan Walker came into his life more then what was required.  Evan forced Deimin from the one he loved and into the arms of another vampire, Lazarus.<BR>
	Since Deimin's retreat from the bond of Lazarus Deimin has wandered the world, his mind a corrupt and evil jungle now after all the influences from the dark world around.  Upon arriving back to Voletta his mind is once more subject to the cruel world as he finds himself opening up to the Dark and allowing his body to be a tool in exchange for light.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4) Generalized Direction:<BR>
	</B>After arriving back in Voletta Deimin goes on a spiritual journey in an attempt to cleans all the badness that he has beared witness to over the years.  Things don't end up quite right though when while in a church asking god for forgiveness and help in his struggles over evil he finds himself hungering for blood.  A child, innocent and young happens upon him at the communion rail where he can't control himself, in his arms he takes her and feeds from her.  The demon then enters his body and he is suddenly cast out of the building by god. <BR>
<BR>
	This will all be fleshed out in the posts that will follow up to his change to demon and will be sent to the Breed Coordinator in charge of the approval before the submittal of the CS if approved.<BR>
