Unfortunatly I can't approve this Storyline.  As I explained in the Ascension Pending letter, I can't in good faith approve Laz moving into the Demon Breed position by means of Wan.  -However-, I do see that you have Malcolm McVey listed as a player in this plot.  If you would like to submit another storyline, perhaps using his PC as a way to break into the darkness of the demons then we would be able to consider that as Demon Breed change storyline.  Please, don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. <g> <BR>

Plot of StoryLine:  As Wan/Naamah is planning to leave the realm of Earth.. <Ascension SL>...  Her son Asmodeus is sent to the realm of Earth to watch over the demoness Lai'Charon by her father.  Asmodues, according to Rabbic and Cabalic lore.. Asmodues is the son of Naamah and Sammael and is the General of Sammael's <Lucifer's> Armies.  Though Lai'Charon <MalcMcVey> is a demonlord...  Pappa feels that she will need someone well versed in the tactics of military combat should that ever be needed.  So he is sent to Earth... the body chosen is that of Lazarus... <BR>
     Lazarus is and has been forever falling into the depths of despair.. he journeys into Bayou Savage, intending to get forever lost.  Instead he comes upon an old building. He enters the building and finds himself stepping into a dream world... in fact he has stepped into the realm of Hell and comes face to face with Sammael, Naamah and Asmodeus... He is taken on a journey when he enjoys the sights that greet his eyes.. the battles and those poor hopless souls that are being tormented.. like he has been tormented since Giacomo turned him to the society of the vampire.  He is made an offer.. to be able to see the glory of sunlight once more, if he takes Asmodeus into him and becomes his host... a deal that Lazarus readily accepts.<BR>
     He leaves the building, and is actually stepping into the light, a new aspect coming over him....  feeling a mission now that must be accomplished.. a two pronged mission...<BR>
     a)  Watching over Lai'Charon and coming to her aid in case of a war<BR>
     b)  If at all possible... starting a war.<BR>
