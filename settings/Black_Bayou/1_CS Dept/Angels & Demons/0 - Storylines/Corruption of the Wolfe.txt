(This helps us sort through SL's and get to yours quickly if there's a question) <BR>
<BR>
1) Title of Storyline<BR>
Corruption of the Wolfe.<BR>
<BR>
2) Players involved (screen and character names)<BR>
KevinWolfeBB (Kevin Wolfe, Jr.)<BR>
<BR>
3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
Kevin Wolfe's soul is taken over by the Dark, him becoming possessed by a Demon named Barret. After years of unassertiveness and lack of confidence, the possessed Kevin regains this. The corrupted man again applies to become a Sheriff's Deputy, this time looking to become a model citizen, The ex-politician may again assume political office, and the power again return to the dark, allowing control of Voletta and perhaps beyond. <BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)<BR>
During the course of past times, Kevin has been betrayed and has betrayed. The ex-city councilman and Senior Deputy Sheriff's life has been taking a downhill run. The man has extreme potential and great potential power, yet has been too weak minded and ignorant to make us of it. Now damned his possibilities of becoming something great are extremely limited. Unable to see daylight, and stuck under the watchful eye of the family, Kevin as of late has seeked ways of ridding himself of the curse. During the late nights of past, Dr. Beth Angel has been doing testing on his blood trying to find a cure. But the probabilities of finding a cure is very limited and as it may take many years, perhaps decades to free him from it. Anger and hate pilled onto him, the wishes of power and greed take him over Kevin has become desperate for him again to be mortal or something more. Something that could provide his mind and body a better use, something that could make him powerful, and have a better purpose. With no help from praying to "God", Kevin decides ridding himself from the Earth would be better than living without a purpose. In the early morning hours Kevin sits outside ready to burn to death. When a voice or more of a summoning arises in him, he moves to the top of the Vordenburg Manor. Falling to his knees he closes his eyes, no longer praying to "God", but to the evil of the darkness, hoping for salvation. As hours pass daylight comes closer, and as the sun peeks over the horizon a flash can be seen in the sky, a lightning bolt hits the body transferring a sudden horrible pain, and allowing the demon to corrupt the soul.<BR>
