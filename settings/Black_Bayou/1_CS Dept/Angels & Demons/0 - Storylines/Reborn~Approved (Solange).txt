3) Summary: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="0"><B>5/25/99...I 'offed' my first character in a fit of pique over OOC matters that I knew I couldn't prove and so didn't bother to even bring to staff's attention.  My fault, certainly.  Sol's 'death' was a suicide, slashed wrists.  But when I chose to attempt to kill Solange, way back when, I forgot one very important thing; she had been ghouled only 5 days prior to her 'death'.<BR>
<BR>
Ghouls heal.  Her most recent CS is reproduced below, and I've given the link to her ghouling post.<BR>
<BR>
There was no ST session involved in Solange's death, and no other characters/PCs involved.  I propose a SL in which she isn't truly dead, having been rescued from her house shortly after the suicide attempt by her guardian angel (a PC) named Israfel.<BR>
<BR>
It was established in an early post that Israfel, her brother angel, was there specially as her guardian.<BR>

<BR>
Israfel was a PC angel with a CS, and though he was her guardian, he worked with others in Voletta, as well.<BR>

I propose that Israfel returned to Voletta at the time that Solange was ghouled, directed by the Light, and was watching her...and that when she attempted suicide, he was able to reach her in time to GOL her and then spirit her away to a place where she might heal.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>

4) Generalized Direction: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="0"><B>Through posts and RP, Solange will return to Voletta and get in touch with the people whom she knew before; posts will also show how she survived death, where she's been all this time, and what happened to her before returning to Voletta.  Forum Director permission has been gained for this SL from HOST ANT Coma.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"></B><BR>
