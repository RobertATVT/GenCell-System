</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Congratulations, this SL has been approved.  After pushing it through for FD Approval he has given his approval based on your individual circumstances surrounding why Aurora had to completely change from an Angel.  This SL is interesting as it will offer to you a variety of roleplaying experiences in bringing Aurora back to the light.  One thing you might want to include is that the whole werewolf thing was also a test, a test of her faith of sorts.  She had to walk that path to get to where she is now.  I definitely look forward to seeing the roleplay and the posts that come from this and have no doubt that it will be creative.  There is a time limit however, two months to make the complete transformation back to Angel.  I am forwarding this approval to Lycaon as well so that he might mark you down as becoming one of the light in two months time.  <BR>

3) Summary (what you want to happen) </I>What I want to happen is Aurora be... accepted again into the light.  In May of 1998, Rora became a werewolf, after falling from Archangel in April of 1998.  After going on nearly two years, I'd like to start a storyline putting these past months into perspective, and beginning to take Rora back to what she was always meant to be. An angel.  She's learned what it's like to live life without the protection of a higher Being.. and to get past hate, bitterness, and accept love and even her faith again.<I><BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen) </I>Using the theme presented in the Biblical book of Job, I'm going to do a series of posts - presenting Rora with various afflictions, both to herself, and to her family.  If Jackson chooses to do anything, it will be of his own will.  There is nothing that I from this end will be 'telling' his mun to do. The first post will be introducing a virus into Rora's life.  More specifically, the AIDS virus.   With this threat, will begin the serious of trials.  Through physical hardships, Rora will be getting physically rid of the werewolf virus.  At one point, she'll lose her sight.  At another, her hearing.  All will come back in time, but not so quickly that she'll forget the experience of what it is truly like to be without defenses.  One of her children will be affected, which one has yet to be determined.  The other will be adopted, or offered in adoption to Jackson Vaughan.  The length of this SL will be two months, at minimum.<BR>
