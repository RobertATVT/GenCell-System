System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

System/Duration: roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or Gamemaster has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Volange</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use. (##Volange##)<BR>
System/Duration: NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
Effect/Description:  Even though an angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from angel to angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to me a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">ANTEmail 2</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.  There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While an angel is in a</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>nother form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 turn to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can fill any character with a brief and overwhelming sense of compassion and amity.  If timed correctly, the person may follow through on some action they would not have done otherwise, i.e.; giving to charity, befriending a lost soul, lending advice.  Using this gift to derive personal benefit is considered a grave sin.  This mastery can force another character out of their True forms (i.e. Horus, TVF, TAF, etc.).  If successful target is filled with compassion, -3 to Attack for duration.<BR>

5'7", average weight, with short-cropped golden-brown hair, tan complexion, and strong muscles.  She has a slightly mousy appearance, pointed nose, slanted eyes, and a pretty smile.  Kay is slightly near-sighted and wears perscription glasses or contact lenses.  She's definately of no particular ethnic group, but looks like a very thick mixture.  Clothing-wise she dresses rather casually when not working, limiting herself to jeans, blouses and sneakrs.  If she's working directly with the animals, she sticks to the basics, a tightly-woven long-sleaved, ankle-length jumpsuit and gloves, with goggles to protect her eyes.  She leaves off the glasses and wears contact lenses instead.  Doing accounting work she dresses in dress-suits, pants-suits, and casual outfits, and will usually wear her glasses.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

The usual flowing-robes most angels wear are left off in place of a close-fitting pure white tunic, from neck to wrist, and slacks that provide for greater freedom of movement.  Her wings are very thin and featherless, shaped not quite like bats wings but similar, and feel exceptionally soft to the touch.  They're slightly furred.  In Volange her eyesight is perfect and she doesn't need corrective lenses.<BR>

      Kay Landers is the middle child in a large, close-knit family that owns and opperates its own animal training company in Isle Voletta.  She, like her parents and her sibs, has a licence in animal training, as well as a 2-year degree in accounting.  Because the business is family owned and opperated, she handled the financial matters for the group.  Her specialization is working with canines, particularly wolves and wolf-hounds.  She has also handled bears, tigers, and horses, though she's not as good at handling them as she is wolves.<BR>
       Moriah is an angel who brushed with evil at the beginning and the war in Heaven.  Although she had fought on the side of the light, when the fallen angels were banished from Heaven she chose to go with them, feeling that the punishment was too harsh and that they were treated unjustly.  For some centuries she lived her life as a demon.  However, she grew sick of the Darkness, and begged forgiveness and to be allowed to return to ranks of her brethren in Heaven.  It was granted, but since she was "tainted" (at least in her own eyes), Moriah requested not to work with mortal humans, but rather with animals, working as their overseer and protector until she had completed her penetance and could be trusted around humans again.  She answers directly to St. Francis of Asisi.  Her assignments were large carniverous animals, particularly wolves.<BR>
       One day while in the middle of shooting a clip for a TV comercial, Kay was working with some of the wolf-hounds her family ownes when an electrical malfunction set the stage she and her animals were on on fire.  Kay and her family managed to get out, along with all but two of the hounds.  When the fire was under control and extinguished, Kay went back inside to find one of the animals alive but dying.  She prayed for assistance.  Enter Moriah.<BR>
       Moriah, meanwhile, had been reassigned.  She was to begin work, not directly with humans yet, for she had not totally complteted her required penatance, but rather with the group known as lycanthropes.  Werewolves.  She was in the vicinity of Isle Voletta when she felt Kay's prayer and went to assist.  Kay, being rather devout, was the perfect subject for hostdom for Moriah, and she was in total agreement to it so long as her pets were cared for.  Thus, Moriah joined with Kay Landers and healed the wolf-hound with Gift of Life.  <BR>
       Kay still works as an animal trainer and accountant for her family's practice.  However, as Moriah Kay, she's also become devoted to the dual task of caring for both Werewolves and their potential victims.  First, she's something of a "guardian angel" to weres, and second, it's her responsibility to tend to the victims of were attacks and prevent the attacks from occurring.  She's still somewhat timid around other humans, but is an excellent angel.<BR>
