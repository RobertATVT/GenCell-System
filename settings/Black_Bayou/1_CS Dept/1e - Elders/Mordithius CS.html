      <B>Healing - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (no room command needed)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
      System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
      Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds from sunlight, holy water or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the hour is over, the healing process is disrupted and the hour starts over.  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the Forum Director.)<BR>

      System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
      Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

      System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
      Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

      System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
      Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively can not see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form.<BR>
      <BR>
      *(Just a quick note about shapechanging (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, a minimum of 1 Body)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  Effect/Description: </B> Gives the vampire the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The vampire may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The vampire may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The vampire may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed, unless they are thinking about their breed at the time.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form<BR>

  <B>System/Duration: </B>NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between family members, vampires have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The vampire can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance.  Each family member must have the mastery Call The Family to be included in the Mindspeak.  The family must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.  The family member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their family name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the family member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Family members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

His eyes are a deep violet. They peer into your very soul. Their gaze carries an icy chill, which stays long after his gaze has left. His voice is a deep baritone, smoothly rolling over his tongue, but demanding attention and obediance. His face shows not the slightest emotion in its perfection, yet is still handsome in a strange way. "Do you fear death? Death is nothing. Come with me, I shall awaken your soul"<BR>
      <B><U><BR>
      <BR>
  </U>   <U>Background<BR>
      <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </B></U>           You wish to know my story? I will tell you. But know now that there are very few who ever knew this story. My story has been hidden through time. My true existance has brought some to insanity, while others to true bliss. Know as well that if this knoledge should pass further, you will be hunted down and removed. Now I begin, and will reveal my self to you.<BR>
      <BR>
              My true name is Artibaan. I was born in the year 32 BC. Yes, I am over 2000 years old. By trade I was a carpenter. I not only worked with wood, but stone and other precious materials as well. Though these skills are now lost to me, at that time I was unequaled. My skills were renowned and my statues were sought after by kings.<BR>
      <BR>
              I lived this life for a long while. My life was constant. Until the angel. The angel came to me one night, speaking to me of a child that would be born of a virgin. This child was to be the son of God. Jesus. I was to present this child with a gift upon its birth. With that, the angel left.<BR>
      <BR>
              At this point I will ask if you know the Christian story of the three wisemen. If you do not, then my story will bear no impact on you. If you do know the story, then you will not believe what I tell you. But I do not tell you to make you believe, I speak the truth to you because you desired it.<BR>
      <BR>
              I was to make a gift. I thought of gold. I thought of jewels. I thought of animals. I thought of many things. But mundane material items did not seem to be appropriate as a gift to the son of God. The gift must be unique, and have some significance to hit. Then I realized what it was I was to give the child.<BR>
      <BR>
              I worked for three months on the gift. I let go of every other project I had, turning away buyers. I did nothing else with my time. I lost friends. My family turned away from me. It did not matter. I had been choosen by God to present a gift to his son. I would not fail.<BR>
      <BR>
              Finally I had finished. I sttod and stared in amazement at my own work. I had never made something so perfect, so exceptionally beautiful. A perfect foot and a half high jade statuetta. A statuette of an Angel. Its wings outspread, and its arms open to God. The Angel looked as if it would come to life at any moment.<BR>
      <BR>
              With the gift finished, I carved an oak box, and lined it with a deep crimson velvet. Placing the box in a pouch, along with a sum of money, I set out to find the child.<BR>
      <BR>
              I had learned that there were several others searching for the child as well. That they had been visited by Angels, and that we were called wiseman. But I never met any of these other wisemen. I was always some distance behind them, so I quickened my pace following behind them. Following the star that was to lead us to the child.<BR>
      <BR>
              This is when the situation took a turn for the dark. When the Devil finally stepped in. I was a days journey from the child. The star was nearly straight up in the sky, when I was captured. I was taken in the middle of the night. I was taken by a vampire. I was brought to his keep. It was there that I was embraced. He took me into his world of night. For one month I was tortured, set to unbearable pain.<BR>
      <BR>
              After a month's time I was saved by what must have been God's will. A priest came seeking out the vampire. Upon seeing it the priest realized something I had not. The vampire had been possesed. Possesed by a demon. Th priest removed the demon, sending it back to its hellish land, setting the vampire free.<BR>
      <BR>
              The vampire slowly looked about, upon seeing both myself and the box, it realized instantly what had transpired. In a fit of rage and agony he freed myself, and threw himself into a blazing inferno, leaving me alone to the world.<BR>
      <BR>
              I tried many time to come top the son of God. Yet for some reason I was never able to approach him, there was always something keeping me one step away, on step behind. Though I was there for most of his life, as well as his death. I finally took the name of Mordithius, and have wandered the world over since.<BR>
      <BR>
              You see. Though what you may have heard of my story may contradict what is in the Bible of the wiseman story. The Bible only lied in one way. The title. There was not three wise men. There was four.<B><U><BR>
