 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

    <B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between family members, vampires have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The vampire can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance.  Each family member must have the mastery Call The Family to be included in the Mindspeak.  The family must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once.<BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>The head of a vampire family has a great amount of control over those brought into the fold.  The originator of the blood that both killed and resurrected them acts as a link to their master.  The family head can reach out and compel one of their blood to return to them, even over great distances.  This form of beckoning will cause the affected vampire to do whatever they can to join their master, even at great risk to their own unlife.  The called vampire will immediately cease all activity and and travel with great haste to their master's side.  Once they have been affected, there is no way to escape the call.  In addition, this mastery enables the family head to sense whenever one of their children sire a new vampire.  This knowledge is gained instantly at the moment of creation.  The siring vampire must email the family head immediately informing them or they may risk OOC penalties.  The bond is not fool proof, however.  Should the victim not be online, then they are immune to the mastery.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene (see below); takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>At times, a show of power is required to persuade a reluctant child into obedience.  Being the master of the bloodline, the family head has great control over the life force presiding within their children.  With sheer force of will, the family head can speed up the atoms within the blood of the victim, causing it to heat up.  Within seconds, the blood will begin to boil causing unbearable agony and damage within the victim.  Those struck with this mastery immediately suffer 4 points of damage to both Body and Mind.  Additionally, due to the lingering pain and discomfort, all die rolls for the remainder of the scene made by the child are halved.  The victim must be within line of sight for a family head to inflict their wrath upon them.  Wrath may not be used more than once on the same individual per night.<BR>

      An agile young woman looking around 25 steps out of the shadowy veil of fog of Voletta.  Ringlets of golden blond hair circle around her lithe form, wisping to frame her angelicly sweet face.  Bright cerulean eyes shine as a slight smile curls on her rose lips... a pert nose in the center of her face.  As her smile widens tiny crinkles show around her eyes as her long fingers move to adjust the short skirt.  She dresses simply, a short skirt and plain shirt, showing off her feminine curves... a certain curiosity and amorous light eminates from her, shining on her young features.  She stands at 5"7 and weighs a light 120 pounds.  She is toned, agile, but appears innocent and fragile to some...<BR>

      <I>"No!  I can't support three children William!" her mother had yelled when she found out she was not having twins, but triplets.<BR>
      "What can I say Maria?  There is nothing we can do, what do you want me to say? give one away?" he had said out of sheer rage, but she glared slightly and said..<BR>
      "Yes, that is exactly what I want you to do."...<BR>
      <BR>
      </I>A stunning young woman, she was raised in a small town called Cheshire, Connecticut.  She has golden blond ringlets and clear cerulean eyes.  She stands at 5'7", and weighs an agile 110 lbs.  Yet she is not fragile, far from it.  Her name, Devorah Williams... her parents Cynthia and Derk Williams.  She was sent away to never meet her parents, ever.  Her father, William DeLuise(real father that is), was an assassin with a corporation and has recently been killed during a job.  Her mother, real mother, Maria DeLuise, was murdered when she had trned 13, by her second husband Stone Recardo.  Stone is also gone, along with her half brother Tony.  He was the same age as she was, a young 25.  Never having met him, she only has the storiees which to her are as real as reality.  <BR>
      <BR>
      It was her 16th birthday that she found out she was not her parents daughter, that her mother was not able to have children.  She was from a family in LA, the DeLuise's.  Dev wanted to find her family more than anything in the whole wide world, and left home to search.  What she uncovered was that she would never find her parents in LA, both were dead.  But her sisters, Melissa and Allison, were out there somewhere.  Dev was able to trace Melissa to Isle Voletta from some neighbors.  And so she left again..<BR>
      <BR>
      What she found was that her sister was missing, vanished without a trace.  She found a locket with a picture of their dead father and brother and wears it now in memory of her dieing family.  She has also found Melissa's past husband, Paul Beuregarde.  She loves Paul for reasons she cannot explain, as if she knows him from another time...another life possibly.  She and Paul were to wed, but he was unexpectedly killed by a demonic man named Danny Folton, and she was put under control of him.  Danny revived Paul so that he would not remember her or anything that has happened in the past years.  She is struggling to have a normal life, but that doesn't seem possible in Voletta...or does it??<BR>
