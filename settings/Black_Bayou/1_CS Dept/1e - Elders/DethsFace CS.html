 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>The head of a vampire family has a great amount of control over those brought into the fold.  The originator of the blood that both killed and resurrected them acts as a link to their master.  The family head can reach out and compel one of their blood to return to them, even over great distances.  This form of beckoning will cause the affected vampire to do whatever they can to join their master, even at great risk to their own unlife.  The called vampire will immediately cease all activity and and travel with great haste to their master's side.  Once they have been affected, there is no way to escape the call.  In addition, this mastery enables the family head to sense whenever one of their children sire a new vampire.  This knowledge is gained instantly at the moment of creation.  The siring vampire must email the family head immediately informing them or they may risk OOC penalties.  The bond is not fool proof, however.  Should the victim not be online, then they are immune to the mastery.  <BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene (see below); takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>At times, a show of power is required to persuade a reluctant child into obedience.  Being the master of the bloodline, the family head has great control over the life force presiding within their children.  With sheer force of will, the family head can speed up the atoms within the blood of the victim, causing it to heat up.  Within seconds, the blood will begin to boil causing unbearable agony and damage within the victim.  Those struck with this mastery immediately suffer 4 points of damage to both Body and Mind.  Additionally, due to the lingering pain and discomfort, all die rolls for the remainder of the scene made by the child are halved.  The victim must be within line of sight for a family head to inflict their wrath upon them.  Wrath may not be used more than once on the same individual per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B> The vampire has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the vampire to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the vampire is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the vampire must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; Instant.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>With a moment of concentration, and prior to the Elder falling unconscious, the family head with this mastery will cause the membranes and tissue of their own heart to strengthen tenfold, nearly taking on the consistency of stone.  This makes the family head nearly impossible to stake.  If all the requirements of a Lore 3 staking attempt is made, you must also roll 2d6+Body+Athletics vs victim's 2d6+Body+Athletics (the Body is the victims particular max, not what they currently hold). This roll is a physical attempt to pound the steak through the toughened membranes of the Elder's heart.  Only one attempt can be made to break through.  If the attacker win the roll, the Elder dies.  If the attacker looses the roll, it triggers an unconscious Mass Mindspeak that is transmitted automatically to all of the Elders children normally reachable by such means.  This version of Mindspeak not only pinpoints the Elders current location, but it also works for family members who aren't even online, so Email is okay.  (The scene will not be paused for the Elder to return Email or answer other IMs - this is for an emergency 'send' only)  There are several other benefits to this mastery besides the hardening of the heart.  All long range staking attempts will automatically fail.  The Elder will receive 2 points of free Body loss per round with no effect.  All other damage taken after this 2 Body will effect the Elder normally for the remainder of the round.  This remains in effect for the entire scene once activated.  On the downside, Elders receive -4 to their Quickness due to the toughening of their skin and if the elder doesn't make their TN to activate this mastery, they will be stunned for one round due to shock on their heart and are unable to attempt it again for 5 rounds after that.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

   <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeting for attacks.  They may not be seen, but they may be smelled or heard.  Casting light directly at the vampire will destroy its shadows. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and speaking softly, a vampire can lull its victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  The command should be carefully phrased as a witty target could twist the command around if there are any loopholes.  The victim will remember everything that happens, but will not be sure why they took those actions (unless they have Vampire Lore Level 2 or higher and succeed in their Lore roll).  If the victim takes any damage, they are instantly snapped out of this mind controlling effect.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>At 16, he thought he knew everything. And against his parents wishes, ran off and got married. But it wasnt to last. The thing he hated most would seperate them after only a month. Gangs. He had a natural hate for them, which some people found strange when they saw his manner of dress. But the decision was made, the gang over him and he hopped the first flight to the west coast, LA. He worked in the clubs as a bouncer and grew up tough, before long he was in charge of a group of "Security Enforcement" at the club Raven and was being assigned as a personal bodyguard for some of the more important clients. That is where he picked up the name most call him by, Death's Face. He wasnt one to be toyed with, and had proven that by his emotionless killing of 2 men and the wounding of another for an attempted kidnapping of a woman he had been assigned to protect... He gave no warning shots before he put bullets through their hearts and a round in the others leg as he tried to flee the scene. He still dispised the gangs, and the LA riots were too much for him so he headed back for the east coast, making his way through Vegas and ending up losing a whole lot more than his money to the brunette dealer on a side bet.  That night, after her shift finished he became a creature of the night... a vampire. It was only a matter of days before he was on the road again, heading to the east coast and Atlanta in particular. After spending a while working for lesser politicians, he was noticed and hired on by the ex-governor when he took down a knife weilding nutcase that was trying to get into one of the many public speeches hosted by the ex-Gov.  Reaction had been swift and decisive. The man had bluffed his way past the City's Finest with a knife to a girls throat and then run into Christian in the hall outside.  It was one smooth movement that brought the Heckler and Koch USP from the FBI style holster, activated the laser sight on the mans forehead, and fired a single round, dropping him without ever speaking. After he had dealt with the local cops for the shooting, an aide had been waiting to take him to his new employer who gave him the Southern boy charm routine as he explained exactly what he want him to do. Kill anything or anyone that was a threat to his daughter. Christian was handed a plane ticket and a file concerning Voletta and the Gov's daughter as he left for the airport.<BR>

  Upon reviewing your lousy, no-good, stinking family, I have come to the conclusion that you now are the proud owner of Elder Status.  Please feel free to make the necessary changes to your sheet and attach this note to the bottom of the sheet for the inital UD.  Afterwards I will require you to send me a monthly report of how many and which vampies are still around and playing. Should this not be done, Elder Status will be removed and the application for such will be required once more.<BR>
