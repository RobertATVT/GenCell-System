Effect/Description:  By establishing eye contact and speaking softly, a vampire can lull its victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  For example, the vampire can lull a victim into willingly allowing the vampire to feed from them.  The command should be carefully phrased as a witty target could twist the command around if there are any loopholes.  The victim will remember everything that happens, but will not be sure why they took those actions (unless they have Vampire Lore Level 2 or higher and succeed in their Lore roll).  If the victim takes any damage, they are instantly snapped out of this mind controlling effect.        <BR>

        Description:  This skill reflects the character's overall reaction speed, determining how quickly they generally react to a given situation (this process is known as the Initiative Phase of combat).  Should you purchase Reflexes level 8, you will be able to grab and use one item during combat.  Normally, you have to grab and then use taking two separate actions.  This "quick draw" effect does not require a roll.   You must have enough hands free to wield the weapon in order to quickly ready it.  <BR>

      <B>Description:</B>  Another form of entertainment, special effects are used in many different mediums, from concerts (stage explosions) to Hollywood movies (make-up, stage explosions).  Characters may utilize this ability to create and handle stage flames and explosions as well as create suitable disguises.  The target number varies, depending on the situation.  The Gamemaster has the final say, but should follow this scale: small, flashy pyrotechnics / slight facial feature changes = 16; medium size explosive effects / drastic appearance change = 18; large explosive pyrotechnics / the most extensive changes to appearance = 20.<BR>

      <B>Description: </B>Whether it's a broken twig or a stone turned just the right way, the experienced huntsman knows what to look for when tracking prey through rural areas.  The target number is based on the type of terrain and how fast the target is moving.  For instance: If the target is running full speed through the woods, the target number would be 14; if the target was walking carefully through the swamp, the target number might be 20.  Having enhanced senses would decrease the target number by 4.  A Gamemaster has final say over the target number.<BR>

The originator of the blood that both killed and resurrected them acts as a link to their master.  The family head can reach out and compel one of their blood to return to them, even over great distances.  This form of beckoning will cause the affected vampire to do whatever they can to join their master, even at great risk to their own unlife.  The called vampire will immediately cease all activity and and travel with great haste to their master's side.  Once they have been affected, there is no way to escape the call.  In addition, this mastery enables the family head to sense whenever one of their children sire a new vampire.  This knowledge is gained instantly at the moment of creation.  The siring vampire must email the family head immediately informing them or they may risk OOC penalties.  The bond is not fool proof, however.  Should the victim not be online, then they are immune to the mastery.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> <BR>

Being the master of the bloodline, the family head has great control over the life force presiding within their children.  With sheer force of will, the family head can speed up the atoms within the blood of the victim, causing it to heat up.  Within seconds, the blood will begin to boil causing unbearable agony and damage within the victim.  Those struck with this mastery immediately suffer 4 points of damage to both Body and Mind.  Additionally, due to the lingering pain and discomfort, all die rolls for the remainder of the scene made by the child are halved.  The victim must be within line of sight for a family head to inflict their wrath upon them.  Wrath may not be used more than once on the same individual per night.<BR>

(##Shadow##)Experience Point Cost:</B> 125 <B>System/Duration: </B>2d6+Will vs TN 24 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate <B>Effect/Description: </B>Among having mastered the blood that is their line, some family heads have also mastered the darkness with which they live.  With but a thought, the family head can mold its very substance to that of shadow.  They will appear translucent as their skin takes a shade of pitch black.  Their facial and other distinguishing features vanish as their bodies become two dimensional.  The family head can shrink and enlarge itself at will.  While in a shadowy form, the vampire is unable to affect any physical object or person. Likewise, they are unaffected by any form of physical attack or contact.  Mental masteries, sunlight and holy water will continue to affect the shadowy vampire, however.  Another benefit of this mastery is the ability to meld with the shadows around them.  A family head can literally become one with a shadow and travel along it from end to end, completely undetected. If the shadows of two objects cross, they are able to move from one shadow to the next.  The family head must be in shadow form to travel in this manner.  While traveling across shadows, the family head is completely undetectable, unless they choose to be visible.  A bright light, such as that of a flashlight, that hits the family head will pull them from their shadow form immediately returning them to their normal physical state.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

A tumbling mass of silver curls dances down her back like  a raging waterfall in the moonlight.  Eyes of mercury quicksilver flash warily over  everything, taking note of every nuance, every person, every movement, the eyes of a  killer.  Lips of perfect cerise, often curling into a smile with some secret knowledge hidden behind it, like the Cheshire cat mocking Alice.  Often found in her preferred color of the shadows, clad in supple leather in the darkest black.  Boots curving up to her thighs, no heel or sole, in their stead, an extra layer of thick leather hushing her every step.  A dagger of platinum always present in an intricately worked scabbard on her thigh, hidden almost by the top of the boot, it's hilt wrapped in black leather as well, perfectly fitted to her hand, a single emerald carved into a scarab embedded in the top of the hilt.  A cashmere cat-suit of dove gray hugs every curve like a glove, a vest of matching ebony leather cinched around her, holding various accouterments of her trade.        <BR>

Two dark shadows, their names Nuit and Billaud, take her in, coaxing her into the back room with promises of tending her wounds.  Immediately, Billaud feeds upon her like a helpless lamb in her weakened state, leaving her to forget his attack and attribute her wounds on her neck to her earlier attack.  Confused, she befriends and falls in love with Sky, who, after revealing his true form during an attack, during which she shielded him  with her own body to protect him, the terror and incomprehension of his form breaking through the amnesia.  Sending her reeling and into the brink of madness, she allows Nuit to take her, forever ending her mortal bonds.  Haunted with ghosts and nightmares of long dead friends, marks, and family, the night her only solace.  Now remembering her past, she constantly wars between the killer she once was, and the gentle, naive  women who had forgotten everything, and now, had become the dark angel she would always be.<BR>
