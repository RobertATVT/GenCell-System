 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Wolf Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##WolfForm##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Most people have meaningless lives, living day to day with pointless lives.  They have no ambition, do little in the way of improving society, and generally make a nuisance of their pointless existence.<BR>
 	I have a purpose, a goal. I am driven by a burning desire for justice.  There is one person out there who has eluded justice for too long.  His name is Rane Shadow.  He is my brother.<BR>
 	I shall kill him.<BR>
 	Ever since we were children, he was always considered better than I.  Throughout our childhood, I was in his shadow.  He was better at sports, better in school, better with relationships.  Even our mother, our sole parent, always loved him more.  <BR>
 	That's why I left home.  I couldn't endure the constant comparison to him.  It was always, "What's wrong with you?  Why can't you be more like your brother Rane?  You are identical twins, why are you so different?"<BR>
 	Blah.  Talk about sickening.  <BR>
 	I left home, but I couldn't leave town. Money was a factor.  Sonya was the reason.<BR>
 	Sonya, a beautiful red headed lady of genuine upbringing.  Classy, lovely, I needed her.  I was never brave enough to tell her . . .the entire story.  She would always listen to me, always comfort me when I approached her.  She understood me.  We would have been great together, she and I.   <BR>
 	But Rane always got in the way.  He couldn't leave well enough alone, and always had to upstage me with her.  What was it with him?  He wasn't happy enough I let him have everything else.  He wanted her too.  <BR>
 	He knew she was mine.  I had her affections, he just had her pity.  She told him one night, and in a jealous rage he killed her.  He went on a rampage, killing several people that night.  When the smoke cleared, he had ran, left town.  The mob that followed went after me.  <BR>
 	I barely survived what happened.  The man hunt had decided it was my fault, and tortured me in place of him.  I escaped, and had to run myself.  He had killed the only person in the world I cared about, and left me to deal with the aftermath.  He destroyed my life, so I dedicated mine to destroying his.  I became a hunter, a bounty hunter.  I don't want to bring him to justice.  I want.  . . Revenge.<BR>
 	It's been almost 2 years.  That dear brother of mine had disappeared of the face of the earth.  I was ready to give up the chase.  Until, that is, his name suddenly resurfaced.  Rane Shadow, proprietor of one Moiriarti Hotel in Isle Voletta, Louisiana.  Now how would he get a hotel?  It's probably far fetched, but it's the only lead in so long.  If it's Rane, he'll pay.  If not, he'll die for having such a sickening name.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
