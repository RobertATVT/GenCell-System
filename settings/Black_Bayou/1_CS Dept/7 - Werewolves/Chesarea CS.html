<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#408080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B></I>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf's sense of smell is so strong and acute, that their sense of smell can sometimes compensate for their sense of sight.  Werewolves that utilize their sense of smell can effectively "see" in complete darkness.  It can distinguish between the many different scents around him and can pinpoint their exact location.  This allows the werewolf to ignore any penalties due to vision.  Strong winds or powerful smells can throw the werewolf off.  The nuances are up to the room host, ST or GM.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>	Bilingual and possessing dual citizenship to the U.S. and France, Ches is 59 and perhaps 125 pounds, her build lean and rangy with slender feminine curves, moving with a naturally athletic precision. She is a quiet, lovely young woman, with slim, narrow features and porcelain skin usually possessed of a light, natural tan. Her hair is straight and a rich chocolate brown, very thick and falling to just above her shoulders, more often than not tied back in a ponytail at the nape of her neck, or carefully French-braided. Her eyes are framed by dark lashes, their color a slatish blue-grey, as a cloudy sky over the Mediterranean she loved so much as a girl. Those eyes, though, are almost always shrouded behind a silver-framed pair of wire-rimmed dark glasses, or mirrored ones. Her lips are a pale rose, nearly always natural, for makeup is infrequent and unneeded, but constantly drawn into a relaxed, yet unsmiling line. She is soft-spoken and stoic; the smile is something used sparsely, and even more infrequent when genuine, a sort of impassive quality lent to the still, almost mournful beauty which shines in rare laughter. Her casual dress is usually restricted to faded bluejeans and combat boots, all clothing inclined towards the darker shades- greys, midnight blues, and blacks, a battered leather motorcyle jacket or brown leather bomber, favored along with that former mode of transportation, in spite of the personal tragedy that vehicle is associated with. Her English is tainted by the French accent, that showing itself more in the inconsistencies of syllabic stress and grammar than anything else.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Ches Themis (Chèsarea Madeleine Rochefoucald Themis)<BR>
 Born 8 May 1973, Paris, France<BR>
  <BR>
  	Chesarea, or Ches as she prefers to be called, was born the younger of two daughters in the marriage of an American opthalmic surgeon, emigrated to France, and a career officer of the French army. Mme. Themis was employed at an upscale private practice in Paris, her husband traveling often, but the family remained closely-knit. The marriage was the second for both, M. Themis having two children with his previous wife, and the family Themis lived in upper-to-middle class comfort in the city.<BR>
  	The Themis girls were lovely and intelligent, prospering at private schools in their home city of Paris. Bacs were passed with flying colors; the elder moved to follow her mothers footsteps in the medical profession, the younger moving to study at the Ecole Speciale Militaire, taking after her father. Ches spent three years at St. Cyr, earning the rank of lieutenant in her completion and departure from the college. She returned to Paris and trained to work for the Police Nationale in Paris, receiving many commendations, one particularly notable one for her service during the demonstrations against prime minister Juppe in the winter of 1996. In the spring of that year, her older sister and fiancé were killed in a high-speed motorcycling accident in the Cevennes mountains. Ches herself had been slated to meet them just days after the accident occurred, it having been planned for her to travel with her brother-in-law and meet the two for a holiday week. <BR>
  	The family Themis spent their annual summer holidays in the Nimes region of southern France. M. Themis had cousins in Arles, all of their family including the surname Rochefoucald in their names, for his family was descended on the maternal side from that nobility. One cousin well-known to the family was a prospering local painter by the name of Severine Aristide. Ches and her older sister were particularly close to Severine, a solitary and cryptic beauty who lived in the small town of St. Gilles on the Camargue. Summers were spent riding through the moors, swimming in the sea, running beneath the evening stars in the near-tropics. Ches herself lost touch with her cousin Severine when she went into St. Cyr, though they had sporadic correspondence. Heartbroken after the untimely deaths of her older sister and fiancé, Ches returned to the south to spend the summer of 1996 with Severine, not having seen her in seven years.<BR>
  		Sev and Ches renewed their close friendship over that summer, the former finally revealing the secret of her past and the fact that she was a vampire, her existence stretching back to the mid-eighteenth century. Sev taught her young friend the facts of the vampire that summer, and they parted ways in mid-August of 1996- Ches back to Paris to resume her work with the city police force, and Severine to Louisiana in the U.S. to seek and meet another branch of their mutual family tree- a cousin named Alina Chapaev. The two women vowed to keep in touch, but Ches received scant correspondence from Sev while the vampire was in Louisiana, a final missive arriving dated just a few weeks after Sevs supposed arrival, indicating Ches might not hear from her for some time...and so she did not.<BR>
  	In January of 1997, Ches contacted Severines agent, the aging Thierry Laud of Paris, to inquire after her cousins whereabouts and a means to get in touch with her. To her chagrin, she learned that Sev had been killed not a month after they parted ways in France, the victim of a yet-unsolved murder and arson at the gallery she had been attempting to open in Louisiana. Distraught over this news, Ches yet continued her work, advancing further for her meticulous service. In late August she applied for and was granted an extended leave of absence, and traveled to this place in Louisiana called Isle Voletta, in search of answers on the death of her cousin, and to meet these relatives called the family Chapaev. <BR>
