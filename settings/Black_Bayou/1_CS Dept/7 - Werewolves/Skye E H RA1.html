  System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
  Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
  Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
  Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the werewolf possesses a natural animal quickness , which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the werewolf, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.

<B>System/Duration:</B> NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Having such an incredible bond between pack mates, werewolves have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during times of war.  The werewolf can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its pack mates, regardless of distance.  Each pack mate must have the mastery Call The Pack to be included in the Mindspeak.  The pack must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The pack member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their pack name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the pack member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Pack members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The werewolf can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the werewolf takes on the effects of infravision.

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration:</B> To memorize a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs target 2d6+Mind (TN 16 for inanimate objects) / Perm; takes 1 round to activate. To track a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some Wolves have taken an extra step when it comes to confronting their own anger. In order to understand their own anger, they have learned to bring it out in others.

  </B></U>   Skye Heart was born and raised in a small Illinois suburb, right outside of Chicago. She, her father, Richard, and her mother, Sara, lived a very happy life in a small house. Skye got excellent grades and had many friends. She also seemed to have some sort of power with her mind. She could move things with her mind, and sense things that the other kids could not. She and her father had a very special loving relationship. But then, when she was 11 years old, her father was killed trying to split up a bar fight. Skye was greaf stricken and locked herself in her room for a week, not allowing the sun in, not eating, and crying until she collapsed into an exauhsted sleep. Her mother was worried about her and decided that she need another father. So, one year later she wed a man named Bob. He seemed nice enough, but then Skye and her mother found the real truth. He was an abusive drunk.  Instead of his daughter, she was more like his slave.  She hated seeing her mother in Such pain, and finally decided to do something about it. She began to work out, getting more confident and stronger and stronger. On night when Bob came home drunk, he saw that the dishes were not done. It seemed innocent enough, but to him it was as bad a World War 2. He came up the stairs and dragged Sara out of her bed. Sara tried to defend herself but all she could do was yell. Skye was woken up by her screams, and jumped out of bed just in time to see her mother flung down the stairs to her death. Screaming, she jumped on his back and began to scratch his eyes out. He ran down to the kitchen, trying to get her off. She was thrown off in the kitchen, as her stepfather grabbed for a knife. But somehow, she was able to lift a knife out of the open drawer and stab him with it, from across the room. She was amazed at this and also re leaved. "No fingerprints" she had thought to herself as she called the police and reported the murders. According to her, she was awakened by screams and saw a burgaler murder her parents, and then flee. No one questioned her story. She was sent from foster home to  foster home, continuing her mental and physical training.  When she was old enough to be on her own, she moved into her own place and went to collage on a scholarship. She attended Northwestern and that was where she met Jordan Black, the love of her life.  He had brown hair and startling blue eyes. They fell in love and decided to get married. Even though she was only 18 and he was 19, they knew they were making the right decision. They were married and moved in together, their love flourishing. It was only a few months later when tragedy struck her life again. She and Jordan were at a bar, when a strange looking man came in and said he had to talk to Jordan. They went into a back room, leaving Skye to her drink. 10 minutes later, there was a scream and a loud crash.  Skye ran to the back room to find Jordan lying in a pool of blood. His throat had been cut. She screamed and cradled him, telling him to be strong and that she loved him. He only smiled up at her and said, "I hope the angels in heaven are as beautiful as you are."  Then he closed his eyes. When the police finally got there, it was too late. They found Jordan dead and his widow sobbing beside him, stroking his hair.  After that, Skye was different. Here eyes had lost their sparkle and she seemed emotionless. She sold her house and went in search of the man who killed Jordan. These days she had been ignoring her special "gift", but now it seemed stronger than ever. Something told her to go to a place in Louisiana, a place called Voletta. So she followed her minds demand, and ended up in Voletta. She vowed to find the man who killed her husband, and kill him. And she will not rest until she does. <BR>
