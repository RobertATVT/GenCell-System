 <BR>
 Healing - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds from silver or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up<BR>
  before the hour is over, the healing process is disrupted and the hour starts over.  The damage from an attack which removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-playing the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the Forum Director.)<BR>
 <BR>
 Mindspeak - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
 <BR>
 Night Vision - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The werewolf can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the werewolf takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the werewolf can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>
 <BR>
 Wolf Form - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (##WolfForm##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 Horus Form - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target<BR>
  of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to destroy the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been destroyed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic<BR>
  Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Night Vision, Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>
 <BR>
 *(Just a quick note about shapechanging (all forms.) While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, a minimum of 1 Body)<BR>

Melanie and her twin sister are very close and share a very special bond, but Melanie does tire of her sister.  Where Melanie goes Madeline was close behind her.  Melanie and Madeline came from a very wealthy family.  Melanie and Madeline spent a majority of their summers traveling with their parents around the world.  Their father was a vice-president of a very sucessful law firm and their mother wrote historic romance novels.  Even though their father was a very busy man, he found time for his family.  Everything was fine until one day Melanie and Madeline's father was murdered.  Madeline suspected it was a man who liked their mother and wanted their father out of the way.  After Melanie and Madeline's father's death, their mother became very lonely and married the man Melanie felt was responsible for her father's death.  For the first few years everything was fine, until their mother dead in a plane crash.  When that event happened Melanie's step-father showed his true colors.  He never loved Melanie and Madeline's mother, but he loved her money.  It was a bitter battle over who would get what. The twins had to fight for the estates and the money their parents left them.  The courts decided to give everything to the girls except the estate they grew up in and the portion of the firm.  Melanie and Madeline were upset but left it alone and moved to live with there grandmother.  Melanie silently wished to move from their grandmother who was crabby and bitter towards her. Her silent hate agianst her grandmother showed her how much she needed to get away. After a few weeks Melanie couldn't stand staying their any longer and told Madeline through their letters. She planed a trip down to Louisana. Melanie heard surprising rumors about Isle Voletta from her sister and made a point to get her sister interested in staying there. Melanie got a plane ticket for herself and packed anxious to get away as soon as possible. She wrote her sister a last time promising to meet her their before she got on the plane for Isle Voletta. She was sad to be away from her best friend, but was glad to have freedom. When she arrived she first bought a new car, a convertible, she would never aloud herself to buy before. While looking around one day she was driving when she came upon a bar looking things by a beach and woods. She always loved beaches. She put the top down on the convertible and drove along the beach. She stoped as a huge house was placed on a cliff. Imediatly she saw the for sale sign and bought the house. The next day she had her belongings moved there.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
