<B>Advantage:</B>   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The cunning wolf can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near.  For all intents and purposes, the Werewolf is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the wolf -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The werewolf will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Werewolves under dispas cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  Werewolves also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous.  In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone.  No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc.  If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the werewolf change into Dispas, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the werewolf is, provided the werewolf has not yet left the area.<BR>

<B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Due to the werewolf's innate healing system and mind set, its body is able to handle the stress of physical attacks better than any other creature.  They are more resilient to the damage they can take before pain begins to affect their abilities.  A werewolf with Dulled Pain ignores changes to their modifiers that would normally take effect through the loss of Body for the first 3 points of damage.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> <BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Through mastery of their shape-changing abilities, the werewolf can lengthen and strengthen their fingers into claws resembling their Horus form, while retaining their mortal form. This allows an extra +1 to damage from physical hand-to-hand attacks.  This damage bonus only applies while the character is in their mortal form.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=5 PTSIZE=18><B><I><U>Background<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></U>Josh was born and raised in Tulsa,Oklahoma on his parents dairy farm.  He grew up believing in hard work and the rewards it brought.  His parents were good people, but his Father was an alcoholic by the time Josh was ten.  His parents divorced when he was 11 and Josh was left to handle the farm and odd jobs to help his Mother make ends meet.  His parents tried getting back together several times, but it always led to the police being called, and his Father being led away in handcuffs, and his Mother left beaten and bruised.  As much as he loved living on the farm, he couldn't wait to get away from the memories.  Everyday his Mother would tell him not to be like his Father, teaching him how to treat a woman, and how to help his younger sister grow up without a good Father as a role model.  Josh did well in high school, got good grades, had alot of friends, but rarely spent time after school with them because he had so much work to do on the farm.  When Josh was 16 his Father came back to Tulsa and tried to get back together with his Mother...but he was drunk, and when she told him he could not move in he started beating her.  Josh woke up and grabbed his hunting rifle, the very one his Father had bought him on his 12th birthday.  Ignoring his warnings to leave his Mother alone, Josh shot his Father.  He died later of complications during surgery.  Josh was never charged with anything.  The year and a half following the shooting was a blur to Josh...his Mother sold the farm, and bought a small house in town.  Josh worked after school at other farms and made enough money to buy an old Chevy truck, which he still drives today.  His Mother never speaks of what happened that night...but sometimes, late at night, he can hear her crying.  A week after graduation Josh was in boot camp with the Marine's.  Fulfilling his dream of getting away from Tulsa and a career in law enforcement, a job he respected.  After four years in the Marine's working a canine unit, he got out and took a job with the Tulsa P.D.  Thinking after four years he could handle going back...he was wrong...he put in for a transfer after two years on the force in Tulsa.  Now he has been transfered to Volletta S.D.  His Mother and little sister still live in Tulsa, 2 miles from where his Father is buried.  Josh has never visited his grave.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>           Not long after arriving in Isle Voletta Josh met the love of his life, Talia Manor.  She was also in Law Enforcement, actually, she was his boss.  They moved in together and married after that, but things happened he never could have imagined.  He knew his love was different, but he had no idea just how different she was.  And that she had plans to make him the same.  His dreams of settling down and starting a family were pushed back in his mind after discovering the unique citizens of Voletta.  His main goal now was to discover what exactly he'd become, and how to control it....and to track down his wife, Talia, who left him, promising to return.  He left Voletta for a few months to try and find her, but to no avail.  Now he has returned to Voletta and got his old job back.  Just when he had finally given up on ever seeing Talia again, and started dating another deputy, Kelli Marshall, Talia re appeared in town, with no memory.  After walking the tight rope between the two women for weeks, he finally knew he had to make a go with it with Talia, at the very least, he had to help her regain her memory, if he wanted a divorce.  Not long after they got back together, Talia started regaining her memory, and, got pregnant.  Kelli soon after married another man, but professed her undying love towards Josh.  In a moment of weakness, after his and Talia's twins were born, he also admitted to Kelli that he still cared for her.  It was a moment that included an embrace and a kiss, and was walked in on by FBI Agent Andy Trask.  Now with his career, wife and kids on the line, he is determined to stay away from Kelli as much as possible, knowing it could never be, especially now that she's pregnant.  Josh and Talia and the twins, Taylor and Joshua, live in the same small house Josh and Talia lived before, still sharing it with Kilo, Josh's K-9 partner, and Kitten, Talia's cat.<BR>
