<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director.)<B>Horus Form - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<B>Mindspeak -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<B>Wolf Form<I> </I>-  0 Soul to use.  (##WolfForm##)System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)    <B><I>Masteries</B></I></U>        <B><I><U>Physical Description</B></I></U>            Rich waves of hair the color of black-cherry wine fall in luxurious silken ringlets past slim shoulders the color of slightly-aged ivory.  Laughing, darkly mischievous eyes the same color as ripe olives, a green so dark they are almost black, twinkle beneath a thick fringe of sable lashes.  The curvaceous form would shame Aphrodite herself, and Mellina often goes clad in simple shepherd's clothing--tunics and smocks, sandals, drawstring pants stained with paint or grass; the slender limbs are tautly muscular after years of martial-arts training, the smooth skin unmarked save for a single scar midway across her right upper arm where a practice sword struck too hard during a bout when she was 16, leaving its mark in her flesh when the bamboo bokken split and splintered, gouging open her fair flesh.  Mellina disdains the use of makeup, needing none to grace her exotic, sensual features, and the only jewelry she wears is her mother's wedding ring, a simple silver band, and that on a thin silver chain around her swanlike throat.    <B><I><U>Background</B></I></U>                  Mellina Ariadne Kyriakos loved her mother with an undying fervor comparable to that of the Amazons for their Queen Hippolyta.  Born of Greek immigrant parents, her father died shortly after Mellina was born in a fire on the oil tanker on which he worked as an engineer.  Mellina's mother Danae took it upon herself to raise Mellina alone, without male assistance, a task for which she was eminently qualified.  Danae Kyriakos, nee Aristedes, had been a silver medal winner at the 1968 Olympics, taking second place in Judo for Greece.  She brought her daughter up with love but with firm discipline, teaching her the philosophy of the martial arts, then sending her to Japan for training in a more refined and pure form than she had learned herself--not Judo, but Chi.  The training helped to forge Mellina into a modern-day Amazon--no ugly, brutal, gruff warrior, but a light-hearted, agile, playful, and sensual woman who could take care of herself.          Mellina is an intensely private person who does not make friends easily, but treasures the ones she has.  She is of only average intelligence, but determined studies have enabled her, aside from her martial-arts training and artistic pursuits, to have earned a degree in Art History.  She has also picked up several languages other than English and her parents' Greek: Japanese, during her studies in Osaka, Tokyo, and Kyoto; Spanish, Latin, and German.  She is an outspoken, self-confident woman who does not hesitate to speak her mind or stand up for what she believes is right, despite what it may cost her.
