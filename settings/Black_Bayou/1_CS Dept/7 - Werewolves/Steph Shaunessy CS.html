Don't screw up too many times though, or your protection might be your downfall.

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>A gutter born angel: copper curls are kept long and usually left to hang in place where they frame wide cobalt eyes. He was blessed with pale, freckling skin, that managed to retain its clarity through puberty. What clothes he owns of his own accord are simple T-shirts, blue jeans, sneakers and topped off with whatever coat he can get a hold of. He claims to be five foot even, but that's debatable. If he's lucky, he might tip the scales at a little over one hundred pounds. He keeps a switchblade on his person at all times; paranoia strikes deep.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Child Protective Services took him away from his birth parents after reports of healing bruises on his face and body. He was barely in elementary school at that time, and was having trouble both learning and getting along with others. His teacher's report included that he said his father was a werewolf, and just lost his temper. Drugs and alcohol were suspected. That's not what it was, of course, but Stephen was too young to be believed. He landed in a foster home that managed to unconvince him of what really happened in his old home. How? By providing examples of what they believed had happened, but this male figure did not stop at just physical abuse. When he was fourteen, he ran away to nearby Chicago. So his parents, who had finally managed to win rights to talk to him, never got to reeducate him.<BR>
<BR>
For seven years Stephen ran on the streets, selling his body, drugs, anything at all. Anything to keep himself alive. Innocence was burned out of him with drugs and pain. He met with Cade Domremy during those years and found a sometimes friend. He never questioned what made her introduce herself while his 'owner' was meeting with Gideon Fratchild. He didn't flatter himself it was the forlorn he kept turning on the door. Circumstances occasionally threw them together again. His sometimes friend maybe felt he would fight eventually; that he'd want out of the world he gotten trapped in. Before Cade left that world, she told him to ask Gideon if he needed to find her again.<BR>
<BR>
Not too long ago, he found that need. A john went too far, in the beating, and his frayed temper snapped. Fear, anger, and pain - they melded that full moon night, and he tore the motel room - and consequently the john - apart. Instinct alone got him out before the cops arrived. His father was indeed a werewolf; he just did not have a handle on it at first. How would one explain that to the authorities? His mother, who passed the virus to her husband, only came into controlling powers after their son was taken. The drugs had been interfering with his growth, thus delaying his first horus so the not-in-the-book rules could be obeyed.<BR>
<BR>
The hornet's nest of trouble forced him to hide for weeks, until the full moon struck again. Finally, he snuck around his old owner's attempts to find him and begged Gideon to tell him where Cade was. After questioning him, Gideon did tell him where she was. He hitchhiked his way down to Voletta then. A third full moon, and a third torn up body followed his wake. Maybe he prayed she would remember him enough to help.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
