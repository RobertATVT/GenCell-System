 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The werewolves' olfactory senses are very sensitive, sometimes to the point where they pick up on the presence of supernatural beings.  They will instantly know what the individual's breed is if they have Lore level 3 of that breed.  The individual must IM the werewolf's player with the truth if the werewolf wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the Demon.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Rhiannon was born and raised in Maryland, leaving to go to Penn State when she was 18 on a scholarship for her writing skills. She had an upper middle class upbringing, her parents; Aaron and Caroline both being teachers in a college prep high school, which she also attended. Always the one to get the straight A's, she never had many friends, and even though she didn't look it, was considered a geek among her peers. Not that it mattered much, her nose was always stuck in a book anyway...for the sheer enjoyment of gaining knowledge. Her favorite author from the time she was a teenager was Anne Rice. Her books, The Vampire Chronicles, fascinated Rhiannon to the point of this almost obsessive lust for finding out all there was to be found about vampires. It was one of her papers in high school on the origins of the legend of the vampire myth that won her the scholarship to Penn State. She graduated there with honors and went on the following year to write a novel about vampires that did fairly well in the bookstores. In the year after that, she sold a few short stories that were published in compilation books. <BR>
        Then something interesting happened. She was visiting a friend from college who now lived in Metarie when she saw an unusual story on a local news channel out of a place called Isle Voletta. Some kind of strange animal maulings. She asked her friend, Karen's, husband about it, as he had lived in the area almost from the time he was a child. And he told her some of the strange folklore surrounding the island and the people that lived there. Rhiannon couldn't believe it. It was almost too good to be true. Of course, Derek thought she was being absolutely silly to even pretend that she believed anything he had told her. But Rhiannon had read enough books and delved into enough history to know that vampires, in some form, did exist. Who knows, maybe she would be lucky enough to find her own Louis, a vampire who would tell their story, share their side with the world. A factual account of probably one of the most understood creatures in both ancient and modern mythology. It was almost too much to ask for.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
