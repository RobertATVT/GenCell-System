</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<BR>
	I tell ya, I don't think it could have worked out better than it has.  the day that Shadow guy found me out on da street, he saved my life.  I owe a lot to him.<BR>
	Ya see, I live in this weird town called Isle Voletta.  Weird name, eh?  Yea, well, it don't stop 'dere with 'da weirdness.  Ya notice I like da word 'weird?'  Hehe., OK, so maybe I am a little weird as well.  You'd be too, if you seen what I have.<BR>
	Check it, so like, my family and stuff, dey aren't poor or nothin.  we jest. .. . well . .had to work a lot.  So, like, why work harder, when you can work smarter, right?<BR>
	So, my pop, he's this gypsy guy, right.  Don't ask me, I say he just stole the clothes and decided, 'hey, I look like a gypsy.'  Anyhow, he taught me how to take care of myself.  "Always remember who you are" he'd say.  "you are a Damaio, a gypsy!"  I swear he was on crack.  Seesh.  Like I'd forget my own name.<BR>
	anyhow, pops taught me how to steal without getting caught.  Yea, I am a pickpocket. So what, you never stole before?  Whatever!  And it's not like I steal just to steal. We stole to survive.  Ya know, some rich guy, he not gonna miss a few dollars pilfered from his person.  An cops, dey can always get a new squad car, right?  I done managed to get one of dem patrollers Hehe., was crazy.   Damn Radio kept screaming at me.  The chop shop, they dismantled it in record time, found the little tracer dey put on dem things. Hehe., we attached it to a chevy and drove it into the ocean.  Den cops was out dere for days lookin for their car.<BR>
	Enough about dat. You ain't readin dis to hear 'bout my early years, are ya?<BR>
So, dere I was, checkin out this shady guy, right.  He looked like he was loaded, so I thought, why not?  He wouldn't mind contributing to the Poor Da Vinnie Fund. So I's just made a pass by, reach into his pocket, and bam, I had his wallet.<BR>
	 He never knew, or so I thought.  I went off on my way, and when I thought it was clear, checked this guy's wallet.  I don't pay no mind to da stuff except for cash.  I thought I had hit the jackpot!  Dis guy was loaded!  <BR>
	Course, it was too good to be true.  next ting I know, I am being hefted into the air.  Dis guy, he just tosses me against the wall like I am some kind of rag doll.  It was crazy!  I swear I'd danced my last that night. <BR>
	But you know what, dis guy, he's crazy.  He roughs me up, right, and offers me a job.  What a weirdo!  I am like, yea yea, sure sure.  What ever, just get off of me, right?<BR>
	Well, he drags me to dis hotel.  Says, "I need a front desk clerk."<BR>
<BR>
	so, that's where I am.  I work the front desk at this huge Hotel.  Da boss, he's a good guy, just a little hi strung.  I swear he's crazy, but hey, he's payin me some nice money.  Can't complain, could be worse.  Now, I just got to figure out how he has all dese women 'round him.  He's a babe magnet.  I got's to get some of that action going.  think he'd let me in on the circuit?</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
