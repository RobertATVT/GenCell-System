System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Having such an incredible bond between pack mates, werewolves have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during times of war.  The werewolf can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its pack mates, regardless of distance.  Each pack mate must have the mastery Call The Pack to be included in the Mindspeak.  The pack must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The pack member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their pack name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the pack member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Pack members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the werewolf possesses a natural animal quickness, which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the werewolf, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The werewolves' olfactory senses are very sensitive, sometimes to the point where they pick up on the presence of supernatural beings.  They will instantly know what the individual's breed is if they have Lore level 3 of that breed.  The individual must IM the werewolf's player with the truth if the werewolf wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the Demon.<BR>

<B>Generation Cost:</B> 5<B> </B>/<B> Experience Cost:</B> 25 <BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> To memorize a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs target 2d6+Mind (TN 16 for inanimate objects) / Perm; takes 1 round to activate. To track a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.(Rya Winter)(BlazeReid)<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><I>       Ping was the one that had altered her to the presence of the more official side of the law.  Officers were roaming the small Siagon bar for her.  Ping had stalled them for a time, sending Chia Lee to get her into the crawl space.  From the paniced tone in Lee's voice she had made it into time just in time.<BR>
       </I>Damn, <I>she swore to herself.  </I>They are getting closer.  There is a rat in Siagon and his blood will be mine before the night is out.<BR>
       <I>With the grace of a cat she pulled herself silently into the air ducts and slinked along until she got to the roof.  Pulling herself free of the shaft she stood on the building staring down at the Official Law below.  Her brown hair fluttered in the wind, violet eyes flashing to catch the tiniest traces of movement.  Her peripheral vision was sharp and wide in it's range, one of many aspects that gave her the traits of her nickname.  Stripping in the cool wind of the night Brigit began to pull on what she had dubbed her work clothes.  Stretching her arms high above her nakkid form, brown leopard spotted spine glistening in the lamp light, she pulled her tight black shirt on.  Her pants her pulled over her ankles, past the purple hand print tattoo that marked her part of the greatest underground dynasty that lived in Siagon, and up her muscles thieghs.  Thin black gloves bond the white skin of her heritage and an equally as thin mask was pulled over her face.  Her brown mane was pulled threw a hole in the top.  <BR>
          The Sable Cat perched above the roof top before flipping herself down to the emergency stairs; the hunt was beginning.<BR>
           Dawn nearly crested the eastern sky of the murder capital of the eastern kingdoms.  Men from the less approved walks of life made ready to hand thier dark shifts over to other brethren of this walk of life.  It was in the Warehouse of The Purple hand that the morning light finds us.  A rotund man, his eyes blood shot not from lack of sleep but from some inner ailment brought on by one or more of his obessions, stands amongst bodyguards peerings into the rafters.  There is an element of waiting and a staleness of anticipation that forments in the air as these men look about.<BR>
          The silence of this place is shattered as the wound much like that of a watermelon being squished echos through the air.  It's source a black sack dropped from the ceiling.  The sound has broken the thin strand of restraint these paranoid men held and with speed their guns fly to professional hands.  Four backs turn to the rotund man, four guns point to the ceiling.  But where is their target? They stare into the darkness each call upon a personal diety.<BR>
          Like liquid laughter peals through the tension thick air.  Like a wave relaxation ripples through the five men, guns are returned loosely to coats as The Sable Cat touches lightly to the ground before them.<BR>
          "</I>This is the head of Quan Go Ly," <I>her full red lips twist into a smile even as her violet eyes harden.  "</I>Somehow I think that the Ly family will not be ratting out any further of our check points." <BR>
             <I>Slowly standing she pulls her silken mask from her face, the four body guards averting their eyes.  <BR>
              "</I>Now, Nameless One," <I>she begins, her voice peerlessly close to threat. "</I>Honour me by getting me out of here."<BR>
               "Dis had all bin arrange for,"  <I>The Nameless One tells her, his voice showing none of his fear, even as a bead of sweat trickles down the bridge of his nose to his upper lip. "</I>You hab all dat you need.  Dere are passwork, money, and ticket to get you to da place dat you fadda used to hide in.  Dere is time.  You stay gone for tree- four month and when tings cool down you can return."<BR>
                  <I>Her moistened tongue slides out to seductively lick her lips as she takes the offered ticket into her hands.  "</I>Ah, Isle Volleta.  What a ripe fruit to pick."</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</U>After the death of his wife at the hands of an errant police officer, Mark Blake had decided that he had been in America enough this time around.  It was at the age of 29 that he and his 4 year old daughter returned to Siagon.  Business kept Mark from Home for the first 6 years of their stay in the dirty town.  So it was with great shock and even greater dissappointment that he made his way to the policing office when his sweet Brigit was arrest for petty thief.  He was the first to fall when The Purple Hand started their reign in Saigon.  <BR>
Brigit didn't mourn the death of her father, her then 11 year old theory being that it was hard to miss a man you didn't know.  She never knew that her father had died at the hands of the Nameless One, she may not care if she ever does find out.  Now she fell under that man's power and within the grasp of the hand blumed.  Diving into her new talents she learned from all the masters.  Lock Picking, Pick Pocketing, Tight Rope Walking, Roof Hopping, Throwing Knives, Marksmenship, Acrobatics, Disguise, and many others.  She began to take hit jobs for the Nameless One.  Her grace was legiondary and by 16 she was dubbed The Cat.  When she was 19 she crowned herself the Sable Cat.  She thought that it was perfect and found great humor in calling herself the Mourning Clothed Cat or better still The Weasal Cat.  Her close fitting costume only added to the rumours and adding the tattoo to her breast, shoulders and spine was the perfect touch.  When she turned 20 the black market tried to claim her as thier own.  She was taken in her sleep after eat drugged wontons.  Within 24 hours the world was lighter a bad of 20 slavers and heacier 13 freed slaves.  As a threat to all others that would bind her she wore a slave colar around her neck, the chained leash in her back pocket.  She was her own Master.<BR>
