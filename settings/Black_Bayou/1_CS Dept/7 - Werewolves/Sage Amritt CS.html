 These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director.)  <B>Horus Form - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B> <B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift. <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.  <B>Mindspeak -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B> <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.  <B>Wolf Form<I> </I>-  0 Soul to use.  (##WolfForm##)</B> <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift. <B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.  (Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)       <B><I>Masteries</B></I></U>            <B><I><U>Physical Description</B></I></U>    Tall and rake thin -- that is the first and lasting impression she leaves.  Like a raving sugarplum faery cavorting through the mind.  Pale skinned but not fashionable so; not the makeup and foundation pale of wanna be vampires but the pale of someone driven indoors by sickness. Skin stretched over bones and meat.  No feminine swells and curves, no sensual sex goddess here; the rakish form is almost always hidden in long pants of some sort and long sleeve shirts, covering as much skin as possible. She seems oblivious to the heat because quite often she will all but live in the battered leather trench coat.  Not a plain face by any means but not a beautiful one; this was the type of girl that could have been a pretty child once upon a time.  Razor blade sharp cheekbones and a thin, aristocratic nose, smirking lips and wide, demystifying eyes of the hardest sapphire.  A cruel scar dances across her left cheek, starting from the cheekbones just below the eye and hooking downward, going a bit along the jawline toward the ear.  There is a rather intense, raw quality about her, road-weary and paranoid almost.<B>  </B>      <B><I><U>Background</B></I></U>     They had one of those sickeningly perfect families in a sickeningly perfect world, the kind of life that makes any hardworking human want to vomit blood.  Rising from the debris of a war-torn Europe, the family set its roots in London and spread out.  The mother instantly became a social butterfly, warm and charming, a lady with fine enough attributes to be a queen.  The father was a jeweler, heartlessly stepping one those who had fallen in the aftermath of war to collect the money from their pockets.  It was the ideal family, with the ideal white-picket fence house.  An older brother was aspiring to be a doctor, surely going to make an already proud family even prouder, the middle child was a sulky young daughter with a bright mind and horrid social skills, and there were twins on the way.      They lived.  They prospered.  That was, until the other war came.  Until the loyal young men went into the battleground of death and blood and so few came back.  Those who win always lose, for victory is bittersweet with the lost souls of the young and the brave.  Being the middle child is never easy; there is the older, adored first child, then the babies of the family, cute and cuddled. Then there is the kid stuck in the middle.  Now, she was still the middle child, dominated by an omnipresent dead older brother, the revered solider.  They had fled when the blood came too close and now they returned to that place they had once called home, this ravaged place.  In the early spring of '52, while they still mourned their deceased first child, their daughter came to them and declared that she was pregnant.    It was really quite too much for the family to take.  They were still reeling from the death, the destruction, and had no room to look at a new life, a miracle among this waste.  Obscene, a child of fourteen to be pregnant!  It did not take too much debate to decide that she should be sent to a convent, hidden away from them, and so she was; bags were packed and into the farms of France she was isolated, leaving her with somber-faced women with accusing, God-fearing eyes.  It was the year that she lost her faith, her religion, any hope that a higher being might actually care for the human race.  In her seventh month, she went into premature labor and after thirteen difficult hours, gave birth to a small baby boy.  But joy was short-lived and little Alexander Pierce Verona was buried the next day in a silent grave in a silent land.  His mother, only fifteen, fled that night, still sick and barely recovering from the strenuous delivery.      She arrived in a foreign town with foreign faces with only one intention in mind -- to find the father of her son.  He had been the son of a prominent family and under any other circumstances, her family and his family would have been thrilled to have such a socially acceptable union.  But not at this age and certainly not because of a child.  It was a distant place from London; it was in fact the village her family had hidden in during the worst months of the war.  It was a sweet, tender reunion, with the innocence of first love.  He mourned the loss of a son he would never know, aged twenty years by his lover's grief, and hid her in a room above the stables while they plotted.      There, his brother.  A solider also but he had lived with body but without mind.  The Verona family kept their poor, diseased son in there with locks on the doors and trembling maids to leave food and drink.  Though no one else realized there was another housing herself beneath the roof, he did not fail to notice.  Through his madness, he was a fairly amiable creature and they befriended through thin walls and doors.  He comforted her when she wept over her lost childhood, she him when he raved about fallen brothers and a green-eyed princess he called Savannah.      But it is never sane to make friends with the devil.  In the dead of the night, he broke from his prison and the household was killed in a sadistic frenzy.  He swept her away, calling her his beloved Savannah, and forced her into the bowels of a prison in a town she did not know of.  Prisoner again; it seemed her whole life now was being locked away behind doors, hidden from people.  He came only to feed her and kept her on the brink of starvation; rain water dripping in gutters provided drink.  He would come and pet her and feed her little bits, tell her she loved him and soon, warped by physical torture and psychological manipulations, she half believed she was this Savannah that he demanded she was and loved him.  And like so many times before, there was a day that he did not come.  He left and never returned.  But someone did find her and she was soon in a hospital with clean sheets and food and water.  For not the first time, she ran, not fully recovered but unable to endure everyone.     Finally, she was rescued.  But not by someone who wanted a lover, but by someone who could be her brother, her father.  Austin Solomon, he who nursed her back to mental stability, gave her some self-respect back, taught her and educated her in all the ways she needed.  After time together, neither revealing their past to each other in great detail, he decided he would indeed take her on as his cub and on one not-very-detail-worthy day, did the ritual and bit her. Afterwards, he introduced her to the way of the wolf and they spent years together in companionship, never more.  Then she went on with her own life.    In the late sixties, she started writing.  Her articles and poems were published in small magazines under the name of Savannah Pierce and soon, that name was spread.  She was a famed novelist that suddenly disappeared into the folds of time.  In the seventies, another writer surfaced whose style vaguely resembled that of Ms. Pierce's, but her name was Bella St. Marquise and she wrote mystery and romances while Savannah Pierce had written historical fiction.  She, too, vanished in time.  As of the late eighties, one novel under the name of Sage B. Amritt came out in England and suddenly she hit America by storm.  A new sensational horror writer, her books greedily sucked up by the morbid nation who thrived on twisted tales such as hers.  The New York Times loved her; like any other writer who wanted to keep their audience strung along, her books came out in intervals of two or so years.  Thus far, after accumulating the wealth of three different novelists, the one called Sage Amritt would consider herself set for life.  Currently, or so the media is stating, the author is hitchhiking across America to seek inspiration.       <B><I><U>Experience Point Record </U>   </B></I>XP To Spend: 5   Remaining XP After Update: 5    <U>Type of Experience Earned                                         Date Earned:</U>   Posting (five) 1/21-1/27   <U>Date of Update          Where Spent              Level          Total Cost:</A><BR>
