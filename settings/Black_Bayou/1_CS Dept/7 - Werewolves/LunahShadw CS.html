    System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
    Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
    Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

    System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
    Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

    System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
    Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
    <BR>
    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

         <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the werewolf possesses a natural animal quickness , which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the werewolf, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.

     <B>Effect/Description:</B> Having such an incredible bond between pack mates, werewolves have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during times of war.  The werewolf can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its pack mates, regardless of distance.  Each pack mate must have the mastery Call The Pack to be included in the Mindspeak.  The pack must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once.<BR>

         Effect/Description:  The werewolf can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the werewolf takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the werewolf can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Eighteen long years ago when Bear was really autistic to the point of almost no return.  A doctor watched over him with a team of nurses and aides.  One young nurses aide took a real fancy to Bear.  The doctor wanting to run some illegal experiments concocted a plan which developed shortly after one night 18 years ago when Bear was totally sedated.  The Doctor getting a sperm sample then impregnated the nurses Aide.  Making her a virtual prisoner to his sadistic plot.<BR>
               A horrible one but a necessary one since the doctor seemed to believe God was telling him what his every action should be. After enseminating the nurses Aide he watched her produce two beautiful red headed girls.  The Doctor waiting to teach the young minds and bend them to his will.  He would then set them loose to seek revenge on Bear.  To totally mess up his life.  Things for Bear would be very different once the Bear twins entered his life.  Bear really having no clue as to anything that happened lived in his happy existance not having any clue as to what had happened to him. .    <BR>
               However, as the awaited moment drew closer and closer something happened.  The Doc could no longer control the twins.  They escaped out a window from his house and ran away at the age of 16.  To no avail he could not find the twins.  The twins being beautiful used there wiles to live on the streets.  Occasionally doing modeling and hoping to become successful.  They had been told about there biological father Bear.  Having a deep desire to be with their father they searched while traveling.  The travels then lead them to the South eastern part of the United states.  Falling apon Voletta.  Their dreams came true as they saw Bear for the first time.  And Bear's long peaceful life was now doomed for a much more adventurous one.  In otherwords Bear was doomed he now had 18 year old twin girls to look after.  And they sure didn't need to be looked after.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
