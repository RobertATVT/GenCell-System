</P><P ALIGN=CENTER> <B>Healing </B>-  0 Soul to use. (no room command needed)<BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>)<BR>

 <B>Horus Form</B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)<BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>
 <BR>
 <B>Mindspeak</B> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
 <BR>
 <B>Wolf Form</B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##WolfForm##)<BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>

 </B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

 <B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the werewolf possesses a natural animal quickness , which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the werewolf, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

 1 Soul to use.  </B>(no room command needed)<BR>
 <B>Generation Cost:</B> 5 /<B> Experience Cost:</B> 25 <BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The werewolf can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the werewolf takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the werewolf can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>1 Soul to use.  </B>(##Scent <target>## / ##Track <target>##)<BR>
 <B>Generation Cost:</B> 5<B> </B>/<B> Experience Cost:</B> 25 <BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B> To memorize a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs target 2d6+Mind (TN 16 for inanimate objects) / Perm; takes 1 round to activate. To track a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

           Javin grew up on the streets of Atlanta. His parents divorced when he was real young. He lived with his mother ( Nancy ) , but she worked all the time so Javin was left to his own devices. He rarely saw his father ( Thomas ) who had moved to New York. Money was tight so his mother was never able to afford to send him to see his dad nor did his father seem to care. Young and impressionable, he ran the streets with his friends smoking pot, drinking, living the night life. His one secret passion that he hid from everyone, was painting. He especially was good at comic book artistry. He was afraid his friends would call him a sissy if they ever found out. So he hid<BR>
 it deep down inside and dreamed of the day when he would be world known for his comic books.<BR>
      <BR>
           As he got older, his art knowledge expanded into music and taking up the guitar, taught himself how to play listening to old Dylan and Dead records. He then went on to learn Hendrix and The Who. After awhile there was nothing he couldnt play. When his senior year in high school began he <BR>
 noticed in the course schedules, a class on computer graphics. Now that sounded like something to help his dream along. His senior year came and went and graduating in the top 10 percent of his class he recieved a scholarship to Georgia Tech. There he recieved degrees in computer software design, and computer programming and engineering. He could work on anything from <BR>
 computers to arcade games.<BR>
           <BR>
              Two months before graduating while hanging out at The Masquerade, a beautiful girl named Susan walked into his life. She was from a place called Voletta in Louisiana. She had come to Atlanta 2 years before to check out the scene. She had liked it, so she had stayed, getting herself a job bartending at The Masquerade. After two weeks together, he moved in her little apartment with her. He really had found the girl of his dreams. Susan was thin with big blue eyes and long black hair and a southern drawl that made men go to their knees. And she was all his. His friends thought he had<BR>
 struck it rich. They were so jealous! <BR>
      <BR>
           A week after graduation, Javin was laying around the house thinking about getting a job and marrying Susan, settling down and having a  family. He thought maybe he would bring it up at dinner. He wouldve loved to have bought her an enagement ring, but having no job and living off of Susans<BR>
 tips that was virtually impossible. Plus Susan and him had to have their booze and smoke. Grabbing a Camel and his sketch book, an idea struck him. Why not draw comics? There was always a market for good comics. Lost in a rough sketch, he didnt hear the door open when Susan got home. She slammed the door and he jerked up at the sound. Susanâ_™s face was stained with mascara from crying. Susan explained to him that she was homesick and really wanted to go home to Voletta. She was packing her bags and leaving that night she said. So much for his plans. She said she was sorry, but she had to go. She said she would be back soon and they would be together forever.<BR>
      <BR>
           After a month had gone by and still no word from Susan, Javin came out of his depression and decided to go to Voletta to find her......<BR>
