They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Born into a banking family, Armand found himself drawn more to the psyche of people.  As a young boy and into his teens, he enjoyed watching other people and trying to figure out who and what made them tick.  This carried on into his adult years.  He led a normal childhood and was very atheletic in high school, even becoming a varsity quarterback in high school.  This physical prowess earned him a scholarship to play for the Tennesse Volunteers.  It was there he got his first taste in psychology and chose that as his major with physical education as the minor.<BR>
 <BR>
 Armand went on to earn a Master's is Forenisc Psychology and is currently working on his Doctorate.  He began working for the New Orleans Police Department.  He attended a seminar by John Douglas and with a little coaxing was able to study for a year under him.   He seemed to have a natural prederliction for this type of work and threw himself into it whole heartedly.  He still does consulting work on the side for various law enforcement agencies while working on his doctorate.  He has come to Voletta after hearing rumors of the violence and unsolved murders being comittted. What better way than to indulge his passion and work on his Thesis at the same time.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <BR>
