  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  <B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the werewolf possesses a natural animal quickness, which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the werewolf, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

  <B></I>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The cunning wolf can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near.  For all intents and purposes, the Werewolf is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the wolf -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The werewolf will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Werewolves under dispas cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  Werewolves also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous.  In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone.  No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc.  If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the werewolf change into Dispas, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the werewolf is, provided the werewolf has not yet left the area.<BR>

  <B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description: </B> Due to the werewolf's innate healing system and mind set, its body is able to handle the stress of physical attacks better than any other creature.  They are more resilient to the damage they can take before pain begins to affect their abilities.  A werewolf with Dulled Pain ignores changes to their modifiers that would normally take effect through the loss of Body for the first 3 points of damage. <BR>

  <B></I>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description: </B>The werewolf has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the werewolf to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the werewolf is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the werewolf must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Through mastery of their shape-changing abilities, the werewolf can lengthen and strengthen their fingers into claws resembling their Horus form, while retaining their mortal form. This allows an extra +1 to damage from physical hand-to-hand attacks.  This damage bonus only applies while the character is in their mortal form.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The werewolf can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the werewolf takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the werewolf can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description: </B> The werewolves' olfactory senses are very sensitive, sometimes to the point where they pick up on the presence of supernatural beings.  They will instantly know what the individual's breed is if they have Lore level 3 of that breed.  The individual must IM the werewolf's player with the truth if the werewolf wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the Demon.<BR>

  <B>Generation Cost:</B> 5<B> </B>/<B> Experience Cost:</B> 25 <BR>
  <B>System/Duration:</B> To memorize a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs target 2d6+Mind (TN 16 for inanimate objects) / Perm; takes 1 round to activate. To track a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.<BR>

  <B>Effect/Description: </B>By baring it's massive razor sharp teeth and issuing forth a frightening roar, the werewolf can paralyze its victim with fear.  If successful, the victim will be at -4 to Attack and Quickness for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in.<BR>
