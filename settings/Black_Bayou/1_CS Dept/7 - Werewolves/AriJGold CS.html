  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
  <B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
  <BR>

  <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B> NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B> Having such an incredible bond between pack mates, werewolves have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during times of war.  The werewolf can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its pack mates, regardless of distance.  Each pack mate must have the mastery Call The Pack to be included in the Mindspeak.  The pack must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The pack member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their pack name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the pack member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Pack members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  System/Duration:</B>  roll<B> </B>2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description: </B> A werewolf shares its acute sense of hearing with its wolf cousins.  A werewolf can overhear even the quietest conversation in the noisiest room, so long as they are paying attention.  When the werewolf player mentions to the room that their character is concentrating on a spoken conversation, they are assumed to be able to hear it perfectly.  This is only true when the conversationalists are within view.  If the conversing people begin to whisper (i.e. <w>), the werewolf then makes the roll above.  If the succeed, the conversation is heard, even if they say <wvvvvvvvvq> (whispers very, very, very, very, very (etc.), quiet).  If there is a loud noise nearby (ST discretion) while this mastery is in use, the werewolf is rendered deaf for 4 rounds / 2 minutes and the effects of this mastery end immediately.<BR>

  ::He stumbles, rather than walks, into the room, arms laden with books that quickly find their way to the nearest empty surface.  In this "office" there aren't many.  Most schools don't leave enough room in their janitor closets to convert them for faculty use.  This one is no exception.  However, the young man manages to do quite well in spite of himself, and the books find a new home, other than his arms.  He looks up, blinks in surprise at the intrusion, and grins widely:: Hey man!  You must be the new guy they're thrown' me outta here for!  Nice to meet you!  My name's Ari Goldberg. :: he extends a hand, which you take, though there is some hesitation in your movement.  The man is short enough that it's easy to mistake him for a boy.  If he's five foot even he's lucky, though well proportioned.  The shock of long golden-brown hair hanging to his collar and his semi-ragged look automatically make you think, "hippy."  Then again, so does the peace symbol hanging around his neck by a length of yarn.  But he's handsome, and he has an honest face that puts you somewhat at ease.  Somewhat::<BR>
  <BR>
  ::He has a perpetual smile on his face as he finishes the last of his packing.  They're giving him a bigger office.   In your opinion, it wouldn't matter if they gave him the Dean's office.  He'd find a way to clutter it.  You glance around, happening to spot a dust-bunny the size of your fist inside the bookshelf he hasn't quite gotten around to clearing out yet.  Goldberg shoves his ancient collection of <I>National Geographic</I> into a backpack when he spies you looking that direction, and mistakenly thinks you're admiring his collection of binders:: Oh, those are for my dissertation.  Been working on it forever, man.  :: He laughs, and you can't help but smile.::  Well, if you'll hand me those I can get 'em packed up and outta your way. ::You hand them over carefully, pausing while he's distracted with packing to check one of the binders out.  So, the young anthropology student is studying Native American tribes of North and South America, with an emphasis on those found here in Louisiana and in Texas.  A page flips open by accident and you fight back a chuckle.  "Studies of Witchcraft practices and Psychic Phenomena in Native American Culture.  A Monogram by Ari J. Goldberg."  He takes the binder from your hands cheerfully.::<BR>
  <BR>
  ::Your eyes come to rest on a picture of the young man when he was obviously a boy, in some kind of tribal setting.  You question him as casually as you can, and he grins brightly:: Oh, that?  My dad was an anthropologist.  I usually got stuck tagging along.  That time we were visiting the Tiwi in Australia.  And here... ::he hands you another picture to admire; this time, he is older:: ...we were with the Masai.  I think we lived with them for about a year.  That's where I got that from.  ::now he points to a Mancala board, a type of counting board game popular with the Masai::  Heck, we've spent time with dozens of tribes all over the world, among other places.  I also lived in Japan a while, in Greece, and, uh, Sweden.  Sounds weird, I know, but Dad loved to travel.  We traveled so much I don't even know for sure where I was born! ::You remark, as you see a photo of Goldberg with his father, how much alike the two of them look.  Indeed, only the beard and short hair his father sported separate the two of them in looks.::  Oh, yeah.  We were inseparable, y'know.  Dad was always active, right up until the end and all... ::he sees the look in your eyes and interrupts quickly:: Oh, no, he's not dead or anything.  There was an accident a couple of years back, and he lost his leg.  Made getting around places like that kinda hard, but, you know, it's given him a chance to sit down and write about what he did when he was younger.  Been published in dozens of journals and wrote a book and everything...<BR>
  <BR>
  ::the vocal young man pauses when he sees you looking at another picture, this one only of a young woman with blue eyes, golden-red hair, and a sad smile.  He snatches it from your fingers quickly, throwing out odd facts rapidly about his father's work.  You interrupt him gently to ask what that photo was.  He stops and looks at you with an expressionless gaze.:: My mom.  ::the photo is shoved away quickly, and the Mancala board is packed on top of it.::<BR>
  <BR>
  ::Deciding to play it safe, you redirect the line of conversation to neutral topics, like how long he's been here at Voletta University on the Island.  He grins now, back in safe territory.::  Lesse, I graduated high school at sixteen -- oh, it's no big deal.  I started Kindergarten when I was four.  They do that some places.  Plus, what's on-level for some schools is above-grade for others, so I got in some accellerated classes and all, with all our moving around...  I started coming here the next fall after graduation, attended for five years (work got in the way) and been a teaching fellow since I got my Masters.  Hopefully I'll get my dissertation done before I turn thirty!  ::he laughs and piles up the last of his stuff:: So, well, enjoy the broom closet!  They actually gave me a real office, man!  ::smile turns into a smirk:: That means they gave me a broom closet with a window.  Well, at least my spiders'll be getting sunlight this time around.  See ya.  Look me up upstairs if ya ever need anything!  ::he waves as he walks away, arms loaded down with books and bags and whatnot.::<BR>
  <BR>
  ::Too bad he didn't take the dust with him.::<BR>
