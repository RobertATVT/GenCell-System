<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANT BB Mail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

  <B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA/Scene; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description: </B> Due to the werewolf's innate healing system and mind set, its body is able to handle the stress of physical attacks better than any other creature.  They are more resilient to the damage they can take before pain begins to affect their abilities.  A werewolf with Dulled Pain ignores changes to their modifiers that would normally take effect through the loss of Body for the first 3 points of damage. <BR>

    <B>~APPEARANCE/EQUIPMENT<BR>
  </B><I>Standing at a perfect 6'2,and weighing at an even 202 lbs.,Cody is a wonder,a God in his own essence.With his usual evening attire being that of his white Nike collar-button shirt and Tommy Hilfiger khakis or Lugz jeans,he tops it all off with his four gleaming 14K gold rings on both hands on the last two fingers.His hair looks like it was kissed by the sun itself with its black shade and hint of light brown which complements his hazel eyes that give off an unsettling gaze of a predator watching<BR>
  his prey.In a strap wrapped around his left leg holsters his Tarus 9MM which is fully loaded since it is hardly ever used.An extra clip,which is designated with silver .45 caliber bullets,straps to the opposite side of his leg of the Tarus 9MM,in case such a serious attack would occur.The Tarus 9MM,which is unregistered,remains nearly unnoticable,being that his panse are casually baggy and the 9MM tends to blend in with its bulge.In his left back pocket sits a butterfly knife,always folded and sharpened for any attack,which also happens to be specially made of silver.The rest of his artilary remains in his black 1997 Saturn,which remains un-harmed from wreckage and is always kept clean.The trunk of the Saturn tends to be the number one place to conceal his weapons.Under a hard,wooden platform in his trunk which,to all,appears to be the bottom of the trunk,covers a compartment of shapes specially designed to hold other guns.Square in the middle of the compartment lays his AK 47 rifle,which has only been used once from the time of its arrival from a friend who now resides in a nearby town.A .12 Gauge shotgun with a scope sits at the top of the compartment,being the largest gun.His Glock 26 9MM stays in the center to the right of the mold.Last,but not least,a  ZF-3 taser remains at the left-hand bottom part of the compartment,taking up hardly any space save its battery pack.Having some illegal ammuntion in his collection,the wooden platform which is made to look as the bottom of the trunk,opens as a latch to the compartment and can only be opened with a key to unlock it.At the bottom of the latch is a small keyhole which is usually covered up by junk and other clutter.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>

        ~BACKGROUND<BR>
  </B><I>      Cody Vereda, son of Angela Vereda and James Vereda.  Cody was born in Lafayette, Loiusianna and spent half his life there.  His parents weren't very rich but had enough to provide for Cody.  Cody spent most of his days on the streets trying to make a dollar out of seventy-five cents.  When Cody was 16, he was offered a job tending business to a hermit who lived in the forest.  Cody surely excepted and went off to work the next day.  Cody went shopping, mailing, helping anything the hermit asked Cody would do.  Cody was very loyal to the man, if the hermit told him to hop he would ask how high....literally.  Cody was making much money for the man was fairly rich.  Working with the man for almost 2 years,  Cody began to trust the ole' man as a friend.Cody's new found "friend" had that darker secret that certain people have.The hermit had been gone one  day while Cody came to visit.The ole' man was out in a field,chanting Cody's name and concentrating on him the whole night.  One night, a Full Moon at that, Cody went to his house just to say hello and he brought a carved eagle.  Cody knocked on the door waiting for the man to answer, but no one came.  Since this already happened once,Cody got out his key that the man had given him and opened the door.  The place was torn to pieces, everything was a mess.  Cody went to the phone but the line was dead.  Cody shook his head and looked toward the door.  He heard something in the upper-room but was frightened.  Finally, he gained courage and went up.  He slightly pushed the door and out of nowhere a monster as huge as a bear attacked him tearing it's fsngs into his shoulder.  Cody dropped the carved eagle to the floor and reached around for anything with a bleeding hand.  Cody was fairly large himself at age 18,  and found and grabbed a small coffee table.  With both hands he broke it over the creature's head.  It got off,  shaking it's head.  Cody broke a lamp and grabbed a sharp piece.  Cody charged at the beast with it.  The glass tore into the creature's arm.  Cody literally almost flew down the stairs and slammed into the door.  Cody opened it and ran out.  The beast stepped forward,  crushing Cody's hand carved eagle.<BR>
