 <BR>
 Healing - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds from silver or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up<BR>
  before the hour is over, the healing process is disrupted and the hour starts over.  The damage from an attack which removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-playing the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the Forum Director.)<BR>
 <BR>
 Mindspeak - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
 <BR>
 Wolf Form - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (##WolfForm##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 Horus Form - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target<BR>
  of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to destroy the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been destroyed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic<BR>
  Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Night Vision, Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>
 <BR>
 *(Just a quick note about shapechanging (all forms.) While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, a minimum of 1 Body)<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> The werewolves' olfactory senses are very sensitive, sometimes to the point where they pick up on the presence of supernatural beings.  They will instantly know what the individual's breed is if they have the lore, if not, they will only know if the person is living or dead.  The individual must IM the werewolf's player with the truth if the werewolf wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the Demon.  Vampires, due to the stench of death they carry with them, do not require a roll to recognize them.  However, the 1 Soul must still be spent to bring the vision to light.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if any creatures are near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a quarter mile, a roll is required. For every quarter mile beyond the first,  add +5 to the target number.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description: </B>By baring it's massive, razor sharp teeth, and issuing forth a frightening roar, the werewolf can paralyze its victim with fear.  If successful, the victim will be at -4 to Attack and Quickness for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> Name:		Miracle Grayson<BR>
 Age:		17<BR>
 Height:	5'4" tall<BR>
 Weight:	115 lbs.<BR>
 Hair:		Golden Curls to her shoulders<BR>
 Eye Color:	Blue<BR>
 Special:	A tiny tattoo of a rose behind her left ear about the size of a dime<BR>
 Clothing:	Generally, a white jean skirt, white top and white Jean jacket and sneakers  But occasionally *borrows* other things to wear and has been caught on 	more than one occassion by someone as she was wearing their clothes.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER> History:<BR>
 <BR>
 Miracle Grayson was born in 1981 in the City of Los Angelos, California.  Her mother died during childbirth having Miracle and it was thought that she would not either.  She was kept in the hospital for 3 months as she was born prematurely.  Her father, a Traveling Salesman named her Miracle because it was a miracle she was born and lived in the first place.  They had tried to have other children, but each one ended in a still birth or miscarriage.  Miracle being the only child to survive, but at the expense of her mother's death.  <BR>
 <BR>
 She grew up in the care of her father, whom took her on the road with him.  Leaving her with the variety of women that he had picked up in each town.  She grew street smart and learned quickly what she needed to do in order to survive.  While in town, her father was killed in a mugging attempt in New York City, leaving Miracle alone at the age of 12.<BR>
 <BR>
 She was taken into foster care and bounced around to foster families, remaining with one for a period of a year.  She was abused physically and the demands on her were great.  Not being able to take it anymore, she packed what few belongings she had and the few possessions she had of her parents and hit the road.  Running was a way of life.  She was use to living on the road and took to living on the streets by the time she was 14.   She  made her way around the country, scraping, doing odd jobs but mostly talking her way to getting the basics that she needed.  Food and what little clothing she has.  <BR>
 <BR>
 Her life is in the back pack she carries and is rarely seen without it.  The New York authorities have her listed as a run away but not dangerous.  And because of their case load, she isn't a high priority to find.  No parents or other relatives to prod them into investigating her disappearance.  The file remains in the New York Police Department still open but not investigated.<BR>
 <BR>
 She made her way to Voletta, hearing news of the mardi Gras in New Orleans and the Louisianna culture.  She hitched rides down south and ended up there.  With no where to live, she has been staying in the park and recently decided to make her way into the establishments of the city.<BR>
 <BR>
 She has never been arrested but has been detained by police for juvenile delinguent behavior and public loitering in parks and other public places.  She has been caught shop lifting but not prosecuted.  However all information is stored in Police Records in the states that they occurred.<BR>
