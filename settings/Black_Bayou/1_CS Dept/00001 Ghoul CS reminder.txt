<B><I>Hello everybody!  I was asked a few questions by a player about Ghoul CSes tonight and it sparked my interest enough to send everyone a little reminder about them to make sure everybody's on the same level.<BR>
 <BR>
 First of all I make note of the expiration date of the ghouling effects somewhere in the approval stamp of a ghouled CS, and set that date as 1 week from the day you approve the CS.  They can't really use ghoul powers until you approve the CS so be fair and give them the whole week.  Also in that same notice inform them of the after effects of ghouling, -4 to all rolls for the week after the ghouling ends.  And remember, ghouled statistics and modifiers should be placed in parenthesis next to the Mortal numbers, not replace them.<BR>
 <BR>
 It is possible to update a CS that is being ghouled if the CS is in the normal range where it could be updated (between one and two months old).  When the CSes are being updated though keep in mind two things.<BR>
 <BR>
 1) The player should purchase statistic updates by the Mortal statistic level, not the ghouled level.  The Ghouled statistics are not a permanent CS change, updating is (at least until the next update), so they should purchase.<BR>
 <BR>
 2) Along the same reasoning a CS should not loose skill levels if ghouling temporarily lowers their Statistic below a related skills level.  Ghouling is not a permanent CS change so it shouldn't permanently change the ghouls statistics.<BR>
 <BR>
 There you have it folks, have a good day!<BR>
