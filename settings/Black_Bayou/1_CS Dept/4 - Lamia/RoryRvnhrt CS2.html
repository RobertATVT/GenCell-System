Effect/Description:  This spell enables the lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.<BR>

While a lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 hour to cast<BR>
Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a full hour to cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will for the lamia to start over a gain.  The lamia must role-play the hour long casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast<BR>
Effect/Description:  The lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> This is the truest measure of a Lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The Lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the Lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the Lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The Lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The Lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The Lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the Lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way, however.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is cast, the Lamia becomes immune to fire of any intensity.

<B>Effect/description:  </B>Through the use of this spell, the Lamia can electrically charge an item to deliver a shock upon touch.  This spell causes the static electricity in the air around the item to spark when another object comes into contact with it.  This spark causes -1 Body damage to anyone who touches the item.  This can be cast on weapons, causing knives to do 2 damage for instance.  Due to their explosive natures, bullets and shells cannot be charged.  The item must be touched when the charging is cast.<BR>

      Born in Scottland to Mary Cameron and English Professor John Underhill; Rory Janate  was the youngest and fistiest of Four children. Because she was the only girl-child in a house of men, she learned the way men think, and how to persuade them into thinking her way. <BR>
                 At 5, her mother ran off with a Iron welder and left the four children practicly parentless. Her father decided the best thing for everyone would be to send the children to America to live with his sister and her husband in Virginia. HIs sister died three days before the children arrived, leaving them in th care of her husband, Jarold McMarrory. Jarold was a mean man and resentful of having to take care of his brother-in-law's brats. As a result he treated them all badly, although the brothers took the brunt of the abuse and defended Rory from anything worse then a casual beating. They even went so far as to step in fron of Jarold and take the beatings for her. However she was not blind and when her youngest brother John junior was almost killed by a beating she took matters into her own hands and called the police and child's services. The children were put in foster care and soon seperated. But at least they were alive. Rory and the middle boy, Ashland, were to stay in foster homes for several years, Marck and John Junior however were soon adopted by a nice couple who loved and cared for them all but were not allowed to adopt all four. <BR>
                 Rory and Ashland ran away from foster care after one of the parents tried to rape Rory. They set off for New York, leaving word with Marck that they were gone and would hopefully see them again one day.By this time, Rory was 12 and Ashland 14. In New York, they lived on the streets, Ashland joining a local gang and using money he earned from that to feed and cloth his sister. Rory forged signatures and got her brother to help her get certificates so that she could attend school. At 17, Ashland was murdered while watching his commanders little sister play baseball at Central Park. Rory was givent he chance to join the gang to revenge Ashland's death and for security, but she decided to leave instead. <BR>
                 At 15, Rory made her way across the country, using the forged documents to go to school where she could and working at any job she could find.By the time she was 18, she had made her way to Chicago and there graduated from High School with honors. On the night of graduation she met Paul McCourtland, the older brother of a friend. They dated off and on through college and after she graduated with a bachlors in music, they were married. Rory was 22.<BR>
                Rory and Paul lived happily for about six months before his true self showed through. Paul started drinking and staying out late. One night Rory followed him and found him in bed with another woman. For her troubles she recieved a beating that left her in the hospital for a week and caused her to lose the child she unknowingly was carrying. The beating was too much and Rory filed and won a divorce. <BR>
                She decided it was time to return to her homeland of Scottland. There she met her father, the man who had basically abandoned her and her brothers. He was the typical absent minded professor who was sorry about what happend but gave himself solace in the fact that he did the best he knew how. Rory left, and since was there went to where she had heard her mother's family was from. There in the town of, Edinburgh, she met her mother's only living relative, her mother's aunt, Mary Agnas. Mary Agnes was the first to see the magic in Rory and patiently over the next two years taught her to awaken it and use it. Soon after, Rory went back home and to Voletta, a place she heard many of her fellow mortals were starting to congregate in <BR>
