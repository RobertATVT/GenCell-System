The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

Advantage: Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
Effect/Description:  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
Effect/Description:  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Generation Cost: 5 / Experience Cost: 25<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Scene; takes 0 rounds to cast.<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lamia is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Lamia attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time. <BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Charge</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 1 Soul to use.  (##Charge <item>##)<BR>
Generation Cost: 5 / Experience Cost: 25<BR>
System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
Effect/description:  Through the use of this spell, the Lamia can electrically charge an item to deliver a shock upon touch.  This spell causes the static electricity in the air around the item to spark when another object comes into contact with it.  This spark causes -1 Body damage to anyone who touches the item.  This can be cast on weapons, causing knives to do 2 damage for instance.  Due to their explosive natures, bullets and shells cannot be charged.  The item must be touched when the charging is cast.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Spirit Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 1 Soul to use.  (##Spirit Form##)<BR>
Generation Cost: 10 / Experience Cost: 50<BR>
System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
Effect/Description: This is the truest measure of a Lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The Lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the Lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the Lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The Lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The Lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The Lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the Lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way, however.<BR>

Generation Cost: 10 / Experience Cost: 50<BR>
System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs victims 2d6+Dodge / Instant; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
Effect/Description:  By concentrating on the electricity in the air, the Lamia can cause it to sizzle and pop, actually causing physical damage to the victim.  Additionally, this jolts the consciousness of the victim and this spell is used primarily to subdue.  The damage caused by this spell is -1 Body -2 Mind.  The victim must be within line of sight to be effected.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Tremors</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 1 Soul to use. (##Tremors##)<BR>
Generation Cost: 10 / Experience Cost: 50<BR>
System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 28 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
Effect/Description:  The Lamia can pinpoint some spot beneath the earth (within line of sight).  The Lamia can then focus their energy at the spot, forcing it to rise to the surface.  The rising of this energy spiritually rips through the earth causing it to shake violently.  Once this force reaches the surface, it dissipates.  This shaking causes people in the area to fall down, unless they succeed in a 2d6+Body+Athletics roll vs TN 28.  Things on shelves may fall down frightening children and animals.  No permanent damage to structures can be caused by this spell.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=1 PTSIZE=6>	Aara Dominique Kindel was born on November 1, 1973, in New Orleans.  She and her parents, Maria (American) and Tomas (Italian), lived in Monaco, France.  Maria and Tomas were wealthy and prominent, and they were involved in business and politics.<BR>
  	Aara grew up very down-to-earth, in a very loving environment.  Her parents provided her with everything, as in a story-book life: love, support, a castle, the best schooling and tutors, her own piano...even an arranged marriage that Aara was not aware of.  This arranged marriage, to her childhood friend and sweetheart, Christopher, was to form an alliance of political and financial power.  <BR>
  	Aara studied to be a musician and artist in Paris.  She also traveled around Europe.  <BR>
  Her dream was to open a shop where she could sell her drawings, paintings, and photographs, and to eventually become a concert pianist.  She hoped, after her marriage to Christopher, this dream would also come true.<BR>
  	After a weekend modeling trip to Milan with her friends, Aara came home to find her parents brutally murdered in their library and Christopher gone without a trace.  It was if he never lived there, never existed.  She buried her parents and tried to find Christopher and his family, but they had vanished.  Aara's great-grandmother, whom she called Gigi, sat her down and explained to her that she was inheriting everything- the castle, money, everything.  She also told Aara that she thought her parents were killed because of their connections and most likely it was Christopher and his family.  Gigi, being the eccentric woman that she was, started speaking of vampires and how she thought Christopher was one, and he probably killed Maria and Tomas.  Gigi told her to be weary of everybody.  All of this struck Aara hard and she chose to leave France.  She was going to keep the castle, but she needed to leave for a while.  Being a citizen of France, Italy, and the United States, Aara finally decided to travel to the US to see art and find her grandfather, whom still lived in New Orleans.  She packed up her portfolios, her laptop, a few pictures, some clothes, and headed off.<BR>
  	She arrived in DC and went to the museums.  She had never been to DC and the museums were a way to cope with everything that occurred.  With some of her money, she purchased a car, an Eclipse, along with new camera and art equipment, and a cell phone.  Aara took pictures wherever she went and while in DC, even did some drawings.  After spending some time there, she started driving to LA.  Finding her grandfather wasn't going to be easy, but she vowed to.  Aara knew that he, being eccentric himself, would be able to help her.  She found Voletta on accident...she wasn't paying attention while driving through LA, and drove past New Orleans, right into Voletta.  She was intrigued by the darkness and knew that this would be the place for her to stay for a while.  She would be able to draw and photograph very interesting things here...maybe she could get a job as an artist or photographer, work as a teacher, model like she had, work as a musician, or even open up the dream shop...the possibilities for her new life are endless.  Aara knows she needs to find herself, find her grandfather, and eventually find Christopher, but, this must be done one step at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
