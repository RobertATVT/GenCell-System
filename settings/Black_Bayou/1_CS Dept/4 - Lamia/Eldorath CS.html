System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Lamia Animal Form Request">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> and for a listing of the authorized animal forms: <A HREF="aol://4344:1192.lanimal.9394883.595601422">Lamia Animal Forms</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lamia is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Lamia attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>The Lamia has learned to seek others out by manipulating their spell: Mindspeak.  This allows the Lamia to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the Lamia is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the Lamia must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 24 / scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> One of the Lamia's greatest abilities is the power over gravity itself, allowing the Lamia the gift of flight.  There are two separate spells intertwined in this singular one.  <BR>
<BR>
   Solo flight:  This costs 1 Soul and allows the Lamia to fly unaided.  The Lamia can never fly faster than 25 miles an hour and cannot carry anything over ten pounds. <BR>
<BR>
   Enchanted Flight: This costs 2 Soul and allows the Lamia to transfer the power of flight into an inanimate object - some of the most common being brooms and carpets.  The Lamia cannot empower any object weighing more than ten pounds.  The empowered object will fly where the Lamia wishes, though the Lamia doesn't have to be in direct contact with the object, they must remain concentrating on it.  Conversation is possible, but not even walking will be allowed.  This empowered object is capable of carrying passengers, depending on the size of the object - as passenger weight doesn't effect the magic, space does.  Common sense prevails here, but if you aren't sure ask the Room Host or ST on how many passengers can fit.  The object also doesn't need to be in sight, as the Lamia can 'see' from the object itself.  If the Lamia loses concentration the object will lose the gift of flight and will gently fall to the ground, much like a feather.  This has been built into the spell due to past Lamia's dying horrible deaths as their objects crashed to the earth.  The object will retain some aspects of magic if dropped into water (it will float) or even fire (has protection as long as the passengers don't leave the object) as there is a small 'bubble' of protection around the passengers.  However, passengers can still be effected by blows, shot, stabbed and even hit with arrows.  In both versions of the mastery, the protective sphere prohibits items from exiting the bubble (These include but are not limited to physical objects and the effects of masteries)  Think - things can go in, but things can't go out.<BR>

His clothing, once purchased for style and comfort is now worn out of habit, he does not bother to police his decisions in apparel any longer and only his one time good fashion sense prevents him from looking like a bum in mismatched rags.

</B></I>	Gabe has to memory of where he was born, indeed no memory of life prior to the carnival.  When five years old he was found by a group of traveling performers, lost and alone, screaming of monsters in the night though he could not even recall his own name.  Rather than turn him over to the state and condemn him to a life of bouncing from one foster home to another, the travelers took him in and raised them as one of their own.<BR>
	For many years the boy grew and learned beneath the tutelage of these individuals, however, the wander lust such a life instilled caused him to leave for greener pastures, and while the carnival stopped on the outskirts of a town called Voletta, the boy left to find a life for himself.  For a long time he skipped from one coffee house to another, with no name and no legal permits, he had a difficult time getting anyone to acknowledge his life, but eventually he found his big break in the theatre.<BR>
	For many years the boy-man traveled with a fairly prestigious semiprofessional acting troupe, but eventually the call of the circus and his lost family brought him back to the tiny town.  But in the years of his departure, time had not been kind to the carnival and most had left or grown ill and departed from this world, only the boys adopted grandfather lived long enough to wish him a prosperous life, then he too died.  <BR>
	Determined to rebuild the carnival, the boy, man now, went about finding himself a job, while in the process, he discovered something more frightening ... love; and this love would reveal to him many of the secrets of Voletta and more importantly, the shadow world humans lived in, blissfully unaware.  <BR>
	The discovery was too much and the man's mind all but snapped, the fact that the focus of his attentions played horrible mind games with him did not help.  Eventually he got the woman pregnant and they had made plans to marry, but her treachery and his now weak psyche did not allow such to happen.  Instead he spent a short number of months in a mental hospital, attempting to come to terms with himself, when he left the thought he had.  Then the child was born.<BR>
	Lost and afraid, his one time fiance offered him the child, like a sacrifice to destroy old memories, but he could not bring himself to take it, and so spurned her and left town for the second time.  <BR>
	A few months have passed now, while he learned what he could of the supernatural, specifically his hated enemy, the vampire; and he is returned, looking for something.  On the first night of his return he met her again.  She was radiant and he knew he loved her still ... but when they were about to make love, he noticed the pinprick bite marks on her neck and went wild, leaping into his car and rushing into the night with every intention of killing the man, instead he collided with a tree.  <BR>
	For five minutes he was clinically dead.  In that time he experienced things most men and even supernaturals never do.  It opened his eyes to many things, among them, the world of spirits that exists beside our own. (think, 'Sixth Sense' if you saw that) These spirits are both kind and harmful, but they all want attention and in trade they have let it be understood that they will serve his needs, keep him whole, until such time as he follows them into the breach. (This is how he casts his spells, by having the spirits commit the actions or wrap them in their essence)  In the crash, however, he lost use of his legs, do to brain damage, and is left in a wheel chair for an indeterminate amount of time, left in the care of the women he loves.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
