  System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift<BR>
  Effect/Description:  This spell enables the lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
  animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">ANTEmail 2</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.<BR>
  Raven Form:  Body 2;  Quickness +8<BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
  System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 hour to cast<BR>
  Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a full hour to cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will for the lamia to start over a gain.  The lamia must role-play the hour long casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

  System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast<BR>
  Effect/Description:  The lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> This is the truest measure of a lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way however.<BR>

  <B>Equipment/weapons: </B>Rowan carries with her the indespensible modern     wonder that is a cell phone, and keeps a beeper near in case she is needed.  Since she wears no make up, she rarely has a purse with her, but instead has the odd habit of carrying her identification and money around in a man's type of wallet.  <BR>

  <B>Appearance(clothes, etc..):</B>  A cascade of golden ringlets, hanging just below her shoulders frames the flawless porcelain features of her face and makes the pale azure orbs of her eyes stand out even more.  Standing 5' 10'' Rowan is slightly tall for a woman's height, but her physique is far from it.  She sports full breasts and pouty ruby lips, as well as long legs and a slender waiste.  Had God not bestowed her with the incredible intellect he had, then she would have definitely been a supermodel, or close.  Completing Rowan's beauty is the eternally pale, creamy complexion.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>     Rowan was born in New Orleans and lived there until she was 11.  Her parents, Suzanna and Gerard LeBeaux, were affluent people who loved Rowan and her sister Emily dearly.  However this same affection was not shared between husband and wife.  These little spats turned into feuds which culminated in both openly having affairs to scorn the other.  While their parents fought and became the gossip of New Orlean socialites, Rowan and Emily were harassed at shool and finally Emily ended up running away.  She never returned or gave an inkling as to where she went.  She just ran. <BR>
       This caused Rowan's parents to reassess their priorities and to realize that a divorce was the best course of action.  As a result, the courts saw fit to give Rowan to her mother, who promptly moved the both of them to Manchester, England and assumed her maiden name of St. Worthington.<BR>
       While in England, Rowan blossomed.  She grew into the beautiful woman she is today, and excelled first in primary school, then in highschool and finally at Oxford, from where she graduated with honors and her medical degree.  A few years after she graduated, she received a phone call telling her that her father had been brutally murdered and that he was already buried.  The officer mumbled something about Rowan's name change making it hard to track down her and her mother.  Rowan just shrugged at the news, told her mother, and they collected their millions.<BR>
        When Rowan was about 27, she met a man named Marklin Smith and quickly fell in love.  After less than three months the two were engaged to be married and both families were exceedingly happy at the union.  A week before the marriage, Rowan was supposed to go to Paris with her mother for a week, but returned two days early because of a stomach virus.  When she returned to the flat she and Marklin shared, she saw a strange car parked outside and hurried in.<BR>
       As she threw open the door and heard the various sounds of lovemaking, she thought she was going to be sick.  When she thrust open the bedroom door and saw that it was Marklin and his best friend James, she knew she was.<BR>
       Marklin immediately apologized and said that he was just testing things to see if had done all he had wanted to before he was wed.  But...his excuses fell on ears which plotted.  On the outside, Rowan seemed the picture of placidness..but inside, she raged.  This anger found an outlet the night before the wedding when she injected Marklin with a lethal dose of potassium chloride and watched him as his heart exploded.<BR>
       The doctors ruled it a freak miral cardial infarction and after a long funeral, Rowan's mother decided to send her away from Manchester.  She asked Rowan where she wanted to go and all Rowan could think of was that tiny quiet little town in Louisianna where she and her family had vacationed while they lived in New Orleans and where no one would know her.<BR>
