They are called many things from Stage Hand, Entertainment Assistant, Makeup Artist, Best Boy, Grip, Lighting Director, what have you.  These are the people who actually make the magic happen during an entertainment event.  They apply the make-up, they make sure the lighting is just right and ensure the smoke pots will ignite right on cue.  They run the mixing boards and the laser light shows.  Without their creative talents, Metallica might look more like The Dixie Chicks on stage...and The Dixie Chicks more like the Grinch who Stole Christmas.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>Description: </B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Louise strikes his watcher as a tentative man, often very cautious, and almost suspiciously quick and shifty. Despite his obvious carefulness to the world around him, Du Lioncourte is a very humane man, caring, and often doomed by his own tendency to love with abandon for his usual captiousness. Though his presence is commonly fleeting, it is often helpful, and marked by a flash or any other amusing trick done to set a fellow lover at ease. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<I>"Europe is nice, yes...but it does so smell!"<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>This was the only bit of advice given to a small, well brought up and groomed woman who was preparing herself to emmerse herself in a new culture, shortly after graduation from an ivy league school with full honors and a degree in foreign affairs. America and its strict moral and social code was stifling, and she soon found herself staring longingly towards the sky every time her thoughts strayed from her work as a consultant to a large international company. Though the money she made was fantastic, and she had the opportunity to loose herself in dozens of romantic affairs, the day came when she could no longer hold on to her well being in the US <BR>
	The very day she decided to leave, a British class Concorde speedbird was hurtling towards Paris at 1130 miles per hour, both afterburners lit, nose up and locked as the passengers were pushed into their seats by the faster than sonic speeds; amongst the smiling Americans and foreigners alike being pummeled by the incredible Mach-1 capability engines was the small but rich woman who had set her heart on the narrow streets of France. <BR>
	She found love faster than anyone may have expected. His name was Khayman, and he had instantly dazzled her with tricks and illusions until he had gained enough of her attention with flattery to ask her to be his. They were married in the largest, most ancient chapel that the law would allow, among a private throng of her family and friends, and simply his friends. It was odd, but she had never met his family. It bothered her little at the time, and they embraced happily at the end of the ceremony, with both sides cheering loudly. A bang went off over the lovers' heads, and sparkling embers fell into each's hair. Another trick produced by the kind and loving Khayman du Lioncourte. <BR>
	More fireworks flew on the honeymoon.<BR>
	Enter Louise De Pointe Du Lioncourte. Born to his small, nameless mother who died during labor with him and the now bitter and hurt father, Khayman. With only his son to rely on, the crafty man spent all of his time teaching the boy to cause great flash-bangs to occur on his own will. As he grew, he was given the best education possible, care of his deceased mother's family and will, while, at the same time, Khayman taught him everything that a child could know about tricks at what he called "magic", often aided by his friends in the guidance of the boy. <BR>
	But as time wore on, Louise lost his childlike faith in all that his father said, and as the emotional bond strengthened and matured, the simple mental bond that only children can create crumbled, and a much disappointed Louise found himself unable to work the old spells of  bright flashes and unexpected booms. His father, unable to help, was hurt further by his son's lost ability. <BR>
	In an attempt to regain what was once his, Louise abandoned his medical studies to become a special effects artist. He found that as a stage assistant, he would be taught the very best tricks of the trade, and, in the 4 years between graduation from a private highschool in London and his studies in the magic of special effects, he had learned to be a master, and was capable, though not in the same fashion of old, to do many of the same tricks he had missed. <BR>
	It wasn't enough. He wanted the power that was his by birthright. Though he hardly understood the blood which coursed through his veins, he was intent upon strengthening it, no matter the cost at which this knowledge came. Through his computer, he spent hours tracking reports of unrealistically good tricksters, until he found one inparticular magician: Nitram Talhalshia. His circle of friends had indeed also been known to cast similar tricks, and, instantly interested, Louise packed his equipment and left Europe, headed for the City in which Talhalshia manor was located, and where Nitram was most often seen: Voletta. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
