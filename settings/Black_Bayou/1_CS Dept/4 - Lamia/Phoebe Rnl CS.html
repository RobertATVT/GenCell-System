 System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
 animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Lamia Animal Form Request">BBSTMail</A> and for a listing of the authorized animal forms: <A HREF="aol://4344:1192.lanimal.9394883.595601422">Lamia Animal Forms</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>  <BR>

While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
 System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

 System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

 System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> By casting this spell, negative forces fill the Lamia's limbs with eerie black electrical energies.  This allows the Lamia to cause damage simply by touch.  A loud popping sound is heard as contact is made.  If successful causes 1 damage to body.  If used with hand to hand attack: an extra 1 damage is added.  Also upon touching the victim, the Lamia causes intense pain, sickness, boils, seeping abscesses, etc., in the victim. For each round the target is held, the victim will suffer 1 Body damage. <BR>

 System/Duration:</B>  NA / Scene; takes 0 rounds to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lamia is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Lamia attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim 2d6+Will  / Instant; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to flawlessly detect the true nature of a target.  The Lamia will instantly know what the individual's breed is.  The individual must IM the Lamia with the truth if the Lamia wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the demon.  Lamia must possess Lore Level 3</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>for the breed they are attempting to detect, in order to recognize it for what it is.

 <B>Generation Cost: </B>10 /<B> Experience Cost: </B>50<BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> This is the truest measure of a Lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The Lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the Lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the Lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The Lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The Lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The Lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the Lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way, however.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 25 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> By concentrating, the Lamia can compress the air around itself, which forms a barrier, or shield - that softens whatever physical blow or attack is made.  Attacks cause -1 their normal damage.  Attacks causing 1 point of damage still cause 1 since the spell merely slows the attack, not stop it completely.<BR>

 System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs. victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> The Lamia's magic is a physical manifestation of the collected force of the *mind*.  Stasis is air constriction.  A Lamia molds it with their mind.  This spell causes the air around a victim to compress itself tightly.  The duration of the mastery is 4 rounds.  The first round, the victim is completely immobilized, the compressed air holding them tightly.  For the following three rounds, the victim can barely move.  Their Attack and Quickness modifiers are -8 for the duration.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 Phoebe Renelle is twenty-four years old, about 5'7", with a lean, athletic form that is underweight to the point of looking sickly, perhaps tipping the scales just over a hundred pounds. Her skin is smooth as porcelain, extremely pale. She has a rather Nordic look about her, with a narrow face and high, prominent cheekbones, her features almost sharp, classically aristocratic. She is truly beautiful, and yet as a result of her accident (documented in 11/96) she now sports a razor-thin scar that slopes from the corner of her right eye down to her chin. This most startling feature of her angular visage is her eyes, a solid, very deep blue, almost a lapis, and hooded by long lashes that are nearly white in color. Thick, white-blonde hair is cropped in a short boy-cut, worn casually tousled most of the time. Upon the back of her right hand is the black tattoo of a caduceus, and Greek letters of the same color are tattooed upon her left shoulderblade (reading "Hermes"), marking her as a necromancer for those who can read the signs.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=1 PTSIZE=6><B><BR>
  <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B>Phoebe's manner of dress is casual to the maximum- faded, fitted bluejeans, or cutoffs, scuffed combat boots, threadbare t-shirts and cropped tops, occasionally. Always around her neck is a thin gold chain with a delicate cross suspended from it. She owns a good deal of fine jewelry, inherited from her family, but rarely wears it. At the death of her parents in a car accident (11/96), she became rather wealthy, receiving a black Ferrari Testarossa and a grey Maserati in addition to her own black Chevy pickup. She has purchased a large antebellum mansion on the edge of the swamps, a dilapidated historical landmark called the Maison Griaux, for the family that used to own it. Restorations were completed in January 1997.<BR>

 Phoebe Renelle arrived in Isle Voletta in mid-October 1996. After about a month in town, she was released from a hospital stay, having had an accident where she fell from a rocky cliff by the lighthouse and was struck by a passing car. From this accident, she was comatose for nearly six days, having suffered internal injuries that were healed with the aid of surgery, several cracked ribs, a broken (right) shin, and a broken (left) wrist. A severe blow to the head caused her comatose state, and she was afflicted with almost complete amnesia, not being able to recall so much as her first name. Her origins were unknown, as should not recall them and had no form of indentification on her person when she was brought to the hospital, having been left for dead by the driver of the car that hit her and rescued by another motorist who passed later. The accident had profound effects on an already fragile mental state, to say nothing of the migraines she is now afflicted with on a regular basis, headaches which once caused her to lash out violently. She was left with an acute sense of paranoia, events in Voletta doing nothing to ease the fears which should have been irrational.<BR>
  <BR>
  She was healed while in the hospital by a visit from an angel in disguise (Angelou). Her amnesia and physical injuries were healed, and she returned to her new home on the edge of the swamps, in the company of her Doberman, Sethan, and boa constrictor, Venus.<BR>
  <BR>
  Phoebe was one of those present at the fire that destroyed the club Facade (12/96), and was a witness to Victor Dark and Mordithius' setting fire to the kitchen and building. After that experience, she suffered a relapse to intense paranoia and nervous fits, convinced that many people were "out to get her" over what she knew about the Facade fire. She voluntarily committed herself to the Volettan hospital for about a month and a half, going through the therapy that the psychiatrists had suggested after her amnesial episode. She came out of the hospital at the beginning of February 1997.<BR>
  <BR>
  She is a native of Pelham, New York, and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in May of 1996. Phoebe pursued a side career as an amateur Shakespearian actress, but is truly a scholar of language and studies of antiquities- she is familiar with ancient forms of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and several medieval European vernaculars, as well as the modern cousins of the old tongues. Her obsession is with studies of the older forms of necromancy, trying to revive them and remove the taint of "black magic" that she feels necromancy is always tagged with. <BR>
  <BR>
  In April of 1997, Phoebe suffered a mental break and a traumatic withdrawal over the circumstances surrounding Ariel Sera, her best friend and housemate, who had fallen from her angelic grace to descend to the state of a demon. She spent three months comatose in a sanitarium in upstate New York, recovering from the ravaging of her grasp on rationality and emotional devastation brought about by Ariel's fall. ** Background update...currently, Phoebe left the hospital and returned to Isle Voletta roundabouts 16 July 1997, and is back to residing at her home, brought there by Angelou, and living in the company of one Brennan Daniels, the angel Ariel who was brought back to grace. The winter of 1997 saw her completing her first semester toward her Master's degree and student-teaching an introductory course on religious history. 1998 finds her still in school, although traveling a good deal on a lecture internship, accompanying one of the university's professors from the Classics department. Even being engaged to an angel who was once her best friend...life goes on as usual. Her biological angelic father, Angelou, is absent from her life since revealing the truth of her birth to her, in July of 97.<BR>

 Below are the XPs you spent on the following masteries way back when.  Many of them will be returned to the game within 30 days, so you may not want to remove them from your sheet.  I'm copying the CS Department on this email so they are aware of what is going on.  I would like to recieve a copy of your last approved CS as soon as you can get it to me please.   :)<BR>

 Thank you,<BR>
