Generation Cost: 22 / Experience Cost: 66<BR>
The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

Advantage: Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lamia is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Lamia attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time. <BR>

This spell causes the static electricity in the air around the item to spark when another object comes into contact with it.  This spark causes -1 Body damage to anyone who touches the item.  This can be cast on weapons, causing knives to do 2 damage for instance.  Due to their explosive natures, bullets and shells cannot be charged.

Effect/Description: </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B>The Lamia has learned to seek others out by manipulating their spell: Mindspeak.  This allows the Lamia to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the Lamia is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the Lamia must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>                    Teamhair NicIomhair (Pronounced as TE-a-var N'giver)  was born in a small town in Ireland, on July 6th, 1975.  Her family were well-known traveling singers, and were rumored to have descended from an ancient Bard.  She was taught both English and Gaelic, and could sing in both languages by the time she was 4.<BR>
                 At age 7, Teamhair's grandfather Seumas MacIomhair, a famous Irish fiddler, began teaching her his craft.  Over the next 7 years, Teamhair learned every fiddler's trick Suemas knew, and could learn a new song after hearing it twice.  Also during this time, Suemas had other family members teach young Teamhair the pennywhistle and the basics of the harp.<BR>
                  When Teamhair turned 14, Suemas started taken her on the road with him for the summer holidays.  They traveled all over Ireland, from one festival to the next.  Spending 9 months in school, and 3 months on the road taught Teamhair a lot about the music business, including handling money, getting gigs, and also how to handle herself in the middle of a drunken brawl.  As a graduation present, Seumas added Teamhair's name to the posters and marquees where they performed, and turned over more and more of the show to her.<BR>
                  Suemas took sick when Teamhair was 20.  That was when Suemas told her the family secret:  the MacIomhairs were the last of the Great Bards.  All the things he'd been trying to teach her was so she could search out the Lost Songs of Mastery: the Song of Joy, the Song of Sadness, and the Song of Slumber.  With these Songs, she could take her place as a Full Bard, something which had not been seen in generations.  He also warned her that there were dangers in the world, unseen by most.  The stories of Shapeshifters were true.  He gave her what knowledge he could of these creatures, and encouraged her to find out more, for her own protection.   Suemas was dead within the month.<BR>
                  That year Teamhair toured as normal, because Suemas would have expected it, but there was new emotion and energy in her music.  A record company scout was at on of her shows, and after much convincing Teamhair went in and recorded an album.  It went gold in Europe on her 21st birthday.<BR>
                  Now: Teamhair has just finished her first US tour on her second album.  The last stop was in New Orleans, and she's looking for a place to relax before going back into the studio.  A friend of her US manager suggests she borrow a small fishing bungalow he owns in a little place an hour outside of New Orleans.  A small town called Ilse Voletta.  While she'd prefer to return to Ireland, it was getting a little too busy for her liking.<BR>
