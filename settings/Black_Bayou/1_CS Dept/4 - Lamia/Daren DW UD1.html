 <B>Advantage:</B>   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.

While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

          <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
          <B>Effect/Description:</B> This is the truest measure of a Lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The Lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the Lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the Lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The Lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The Lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The Lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the Lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way, however.<BR>

          <B>Effect/Description: </B> The Lamia's magic is a physical manifestation of the collected force of the *mind*.  Stasis is air constriction.  A Lamia molds it with their mind.  This spell causes the air around a victim to compress itself tightly.  The duration of the mastery is 4 rounds.  The first round, the victim is completely immobilized, the compressed air holding them tightly.  For the following three rounds, the victim can barely move.

          <B>Effect/description:  </B>Through the use of this spell, the Lamia can electrically charge an item to deliver a shock upon touch.  This spell causes the static electricity in the air around the item to spark when another object comes into contact with it.  This spark causes -1 Body damage to anyone who touches the item.  This can be cast on weapons, causing knives to do 2 damage for instance.  Due to their explosive natures, bullets and shells cannot be charged.  The item must be touched when the charging is cast.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description: </B> By concentrating on the electricity in the air, the Lamia can cause it to sizzle and pop, actually causing physical damage to the victim.  Additionally, this jolts the consciousness of the victim and this spell is used primarily to subdue.  The damage caused by this spell is -1 Body -2 Mind.  The victim must be within line of sight to be effected.<BR>

        Effect/Description: </B>The Lamia has learned to seek others out by manipulating their spell: Mindspeak.  This allows the Lamia to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the Lamia is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the Lamia must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

      <B>Effect/Description: </B> By concentrating, the Lamia can compress the air around itself, which forms a barrier, or shield - that softens whatever physical blow or attack is made.  Attacks cause -1 their normal damage.  Attacks causing 1 point of damage still cause 1 since the spell merely slows the attack, not stop it completely.<BR>

      <B>Effect/Description: </B> With a touch of their hand, the Lamia can cause the target's mental state to revert back to childhood, to the age of 2.  The target is able to speak, as any toddler can - but they will make little sense.  Temper tantrums when they do not get their way, blatant disobedience when told to do something ... mischief making ... all the traits of "the Terrible Twos" will be exhibited.  Whatever memories the target had for those years will surface.  The target's mind will be only 2 for the duration.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene + ; takes 1 round.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Even though a Lamia is essentially human, the forces of magick have given them powers beyond that of a mere mortal.  By tapping into their pure flow of magick, the Lamia will be able to increase all of their abilities.  When the Lamia taps into their internal magick source it causes changes to them physically; their eyes will shine an unnatural glow while the skin on their body will begin to wither and wrinkle from energy draining from their flesh to power their magick.  While this doesn't degrade them physically, it still can appear quite shocking.  Anyone with Lore Level 3 has an opportunity to recognize these changes in the Lamia (as per the Lore rules).  While under this mastery, the Lamia gains +2 Soul and +1 Mind for the duration.  If the Lamia spends an additional Soul point, they can keep this mastery tapped and change scenes without dropping it.  This Scene swapping can continue as long as the Lamia has Soul to spend.<BR>

A tanned complexion indicating he's still a daytime dweller is only ruined in a few places.  His most notable scar is on the back of his right hand where a bullet skimmed the top of the hand shattering a couple of bones when he was eighteen.  At close inspection a couple sets of small light pink lines can be seen on the side of his neck, a gift from the night crawlers of Voletta.

        </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>		A story, a story, the isle of veils seems a place to be full of many stories eh?  How about a story that starts farther to the North?  North west to be exact, in Oregon country.<BR>
        		There was once a politician running for office promoting good solid Christian values, and to rally the voters will to elect him he had taken a strong stand against his county's rising teenage pregnancy rate.  A good cause that any candidate would seek to use in their campaign, especially one promoting the ever popular Christian morals right?<BR>
        		But as is often the fact with politics and politicians he too had a secret he was keeping from the public, his fifteen year old daughter had become part of that rising statistic.  Instead of using it as an additional conviction for his standpoint he thought it would be better to keep it a secret.  The daughter was kept hidden from the masses and even from members of the extended family.  Unfortunately for the candidate his daughter would not agree to abortion and he could not find a doctor whose silence could be bought willing to perform an abortion on an unwilling patient.<BR>
        		However he did know someone willing to take the baby once it was born and a doctor to give it an under the counter adoption complete with a forged certificate of birth for the receiving family.  Conveniently the person was one of his supporters, who contributed a hefty amount of money to the campaign effort, to receive the child.  So while the daughter grew bigger with child the supporter's sterile wife grew fatter with the aide of pillows and other forms of stuffed clothing.<BR>
        		The wealthy supporter had made a number of enemies on his rise to power, however.  Included among them was the power hungry Jonin of a militarist encampment composed mainly of Oriental immigrants and their decedents who had been displaced during World War Two for national security.  Since then the group had expanded to include other non-oriental descended people who just generally disliked the current United States government.<BR>
        		But I'm drifting away from my story, the night the child was to be "born" to the investor's sterile wife also happened to be the night the angry Jonin moved for retribution for whatever wrongs he felt he'd been dealt.  The forgery of a birth certificate found at the scene of the crime by investigators and the wife's cadaver showing no sign of having been pregnant served to help confuse and distract the authorities.  With no child to be found in the bloodstained house their attentions focused on the belief that the murders took place because of the illicit baby dealing going on.<BR>
        		What happened to the child?  I never told you I was going to tell you a story with a happy ending now did I?  The authorities found the body of the doctor at the scene of the multiple homicide, but there was no newborn to be found.<BR>
        <BR>
        </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Post Voletta Background -<BR>
        </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>		Five years have past since I escaped what served as my childhood, five years since I believed the lies and half truths that came from the Jonin.  And in a couple of months it will have been two years since I created this life for myself in Isle Voletta.<BR>
        		Two years and no one here knows any better then to think I've been called 'Daren' all my life.  No one who's still alive anyway, not even Jade yet knows.  Though she knows the most out of anyone left of where I came from and where I was born I still never imparted to her the complete story.  Perhaps it is fear of rejection for my faults that I retain my silence, fear that it might get out to others.  Everyone has their confidant's, if I had told her would she have confided the secret to someone else?  How far would it have spread?<BR>
        		I keep this silence for fear of loosing everything, this identity has held up even through the background checks of local law enforcement agencies.  Perhaps I owe that more to the fact that the Chief of Police at the time I was hired was a good friend of mine and probably didn't look to hard.  And then my transfer to the Sheriff's Department after the Police Department closed also probably went through with only a light glance.  There might gaps or holes in the identity of Daren Dwoemer, but luckily none have yet discovered them.<BR>
        		I know there are plenty of other people here like me, running from some event in their past, hiding from it, and a small town on an island off the southern coast of Louisiana.  How many of them though are running from their entire past, their entire history, from everything they were and thought they were going to be when they were younger.  Compared to what the Jonin had intended for me and what the Chunin were preparing me for you might say I switched to the opposite side, and before I even really got started for one.<BR>
        		Little have I found out about my origins beyond what was kept in the Jonin's files.  But even if I knew it now I doubt it would have a serious profound effect on who I am, on who I have become.<BR>
        		As bleak and depressing as the present is now the only thing left to do is look forward towards the future, with the magic taught ought to me by Zion as the only steady thing in my life to fill the void.  An unfaithful wife leaving it empty once again the magical arts fortify the hole left in my soul by the years I spent filling it with alcohol.<BR>
        		Perhaps it is a bit ironic that I summon that strength through the same place where I have the hole.  And my eyes, windows to the source show the fire of magic in green flames upon their crystal blue irises turning themselves into the turquoise gaze that often stares out into the Voletta night.<BR>
        <BR>
