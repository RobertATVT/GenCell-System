System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  ((Approved by WestWd 7-10-99))<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  <BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>In the winter of 1977, Alexandra Erin Crenshaw was born in Chicago, IL, to Walter and Denise Crenshaw.  Denise stayed at home with Lexi while Walter built and managed a formidable publishing empire of half a dozen popular travel magazines.  Lexi was raised and shuffled in the three homes--and single Aspen cabin--the family owned.  <BR>
  <BR>
Being raised in a rather privileged environment, Lexi was allowed to taste test numerous hobbies and interests, but it wasn't until her teenage years that she discovered a talent all her own and her true passion...tennis.  Once bitten by the bug, she immersed herself in the sport and by the end of her high school career had been vaulted consistently into the top seats of state and national junior competitions.  There was much debate over whether to turn pro or enter college, but in Lexi's mind there was no question...tennis was her life.<BR>
  <BR>
The summer she turned pro, however, was a major turning point in her life.  Being an only child and consummate Daddy's girl, Lexi often spent time bouncing from office to office with her father.  She met a young photography intern by the name of Jakob Munro who was fresh from the farm in Montana.  The chemistry between the pampered little city girl and the rough & tumble cowboy was ignited instantly and flared like wildfire through the summer.  Figuring this was a teenage fling, her parents indulged the nonstop attention they gave one another once she finished practicing and he finished laying out pictures and material.  When Jakob left, however, Lexi's parents were heartily dismayed to find that Lexi pined after him daily and even allowed her game to suffer.  She went from earning the #18 seat after the Virginia Slims tournament to falling to an appalling #120 after she and Jakob were separated.<BR>
  <BR>
That, however, was only a slight disappointment in the face of what happened next.<BR>
  <BR>
During the Thanksgiving Holidays, Lexi was due to fly to Montana to meet Jakob's family for the first time.  As she was packing the night before, she began feeling dizzy and hot, and she collapsed before she could finish the first suitcase---the victim of a rare form of viral meningitis which ravaged her body and left her immune system severly weakened, her brain slightly damaged, and her hearing non-existent.<BR>
  <BR>
Jakob flew to her side immediately and remained with her and her family throughout the winter.  His presence and encouragement retrieved her from the brink of severe depression and steadied her through the transition of learning a whole new language and way to communicate--sign language.  Her parents were thankful for the inspiration he was to their daughter,  rewarding him with a generous position with one of the magazines to keep him close to Lexi.<BR>
  <BR>
Eventually Lexi returned to tennis with an increased fervor and passion for the sport.  Without the sound of the crowd to distract her, her focus was even more intense than before, and she was sure to match--if not exceed--her previous levels of performance.  With her weakened immune system, however, it was impossible for her to maintain the levels of endurance she needed to compete.  By the third tournament, she almost had to be carried from the court.  Not once, but twice, she had been forced to leave the sport she so loved.  Not once, but twice, Jakob served to give her cause to go on.  He had become her purpose in life.<BR>
  <BR>
Now, almost 2 years after her retirement, her father has decided to try to wean Lexi from her tremendous reliance on Jakob by giving him assignments and responsibilities that require travel.  The assignments started off small and infrequent but have become more regular with time.<BR>
  <BR>
Usually circumstance has prevented Lexi from joining Jakob.  Mother has suddenly needed her at home, or she has been asked to make appearances for various health and medical organizations.  But Lexi had never been to Louisiana before--had never even heard of Isle Voletta, so when Father asked Jakob to help oversee a small, southern magazine he was bailing out of trouble by buying it out and resurrecting it, Lexi couldn't help but tagalong, much to Daddy's chagrin.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
