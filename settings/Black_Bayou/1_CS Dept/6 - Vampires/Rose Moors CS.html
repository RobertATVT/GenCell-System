  System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
  Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
  Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I>System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
  Effect/Description:  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.<B><BR>

  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>System/Duration: roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 Rounds or 2 Minutes; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
  Effect/Description:  By establishing eye contact and speaking softly, a vampire can lull its victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  For example, the vampire can lull a victim into willingly allowing the vampire to feed from them.  The command should be carefully phrased as a witty target could twist the command around if there are any loopholes.  The victim will remember everything that happens, but will not be sure why they took those actions (unless they have Vampire Lore Level 2 or higher and succeed in their Lore roll).  If the victim takes any damage, they are instantly snapped out of this mind controlling effect.<BR>

  So like a child, made of sugar and spice and everything nice.  One would think those bright eyes were the result of innocent joy, that smile one of a pure soul.  So small.  Five-feet-zilch.  Small-boned, with a face made of feral beauty.  Aristocratic.  A river of onyx tumbling untamed down the musician's back, eyes of haunted silver beneath soot-stained lashes.  High cheekbones, pert Roman nose, pale pinked tiers in a rosebud smile.  Gaunt.  Tainted with maturity, curves where there should be curves, androgynous planes and angles elsewhere.  She moves with an oddly calm grace, quiet lazy, predetorial, and when she smiles, it is sweetly crooked, though hungry savage.  Those eyes- quicksilver.  Bright.  Gleaming.  Shards of broken sanity.  Drugged.  Forever in overly large poet's shirts and baggy jeans that cling to scrawny hips, ancient boots and Egyptian or Celtic styled jewelery.<BR>

 1976-- June 23, five minutes before midnight.  One Franklin Moors is passed out on the dirty couch crammed in the living room of a canary-yellow house that resides on the curb of the projects of Albany, New York, having fallen in love with creatures by the name of Vodka and Jack Daniel's, now drowning in the passions of their juices.  His wife is at home, the poor dear, barely twenty and living a life full of shattered dreams -- Sleeping Beauty was awaken by her Prince, but her Prince raped her of her innocence first.  Blue-eyed, peach-faced, with locks colored platnium gold and a body made of sticks and bones and little girl curves, belly swelled with the life of two when the mother could barely carry one.  There's blood painting the cracked tiles of the bathroom and the neighbors are only faintly roused by the screams.  Because she's hurting too much to actually breathe, much less screamed.  Her husband sleeps as their first baby is born.<BR>
 <BR>
 June 24, 12: 16 AM-- The abulance finally arrived, the wary and irritated neighbors finally roused by the feverishly pitched wails coming from the delapidated yellow building.  Only a few practical weeks in the hospital and a happy father brings a pale but smiling wife and two bouncing baby girls back home.  The floors are scrubbed and the pictures hung correctly; the grass mowed and the paint actually not as painful to the eyes.  In the living room cribs were set up and the children slept.  And Daddy drank.<BR>
 <BR>
 Some time in 1983-- They're seven years old.  Their mother is beyond help, her soul having utterly shattered, her body bruised and broken and housing only the fingerprint smudge remainders of what had been the bright and summery Southern Belle, with her golden words slow as honey and sweet, trusting eyes.  The twins understand wrath.  They know hopeless pain.  Already, tender child's skin turns black and blood is spilled, bones twisted beneath the hands roughened by years of drink and bitter disappointment.  And on one chilled autumn night, the anger and the pain went too far and the child called Rose was left screaming for heaven to tear apart and her sister lay, sprawled in blood that stained the ugly carpet, pretty blue eyes so like her mother's even more like her mother's -- glazed with the light of the dead.  Except the little one's chest did not move.  <BR>
 <BR>
 1990-- Marianne Moors reported dead from a suicide, having lept from the roof of her two-story house and bled to death while her fourteen-year-old daughter and her fifteen-year-old companion watched her lifebleed away in horror.  Or so they said.  Linna Wyler and Rose Moors reported no differently, the daughter too distraught by her mother's death and the teenage friend visiting from Japan too stunned by the events.  The father displayed th perfect amount of grief and Linna returned to Japan after the funeral.  No one ever said anything about a possible murder.  No one ever said anything about Franklin up on the roof with Marianne that night.<BR>
 <BR>
 June of '90-- The girl known as Rose takes her father's money and limps, bleeding from various wounds (a broken bottle over the back, a bruised rib, and vicious inflictions to the legs) and takes it down to West Virginia, where Byron LeBlanc lives.  Byron, called Blaise, her childhood gaurdian angel, eight years older and babysitter of the twins when Denise was alive. <BR>
 <BR>
 August, same year-- The secret can't be hidden any longer.  The Rose is pregnant and her guardian angel turns into a devil.  She leaves and hid herself in a hole-in-the-ground town of Covington, WV, and paid twenty dollars for an abortion.  And after that, she landed in the intensive care unit of a local hospital, suffering from severe blood lost.  Three months later, no one had come to claim this mysterious Jane Doe who was a mere baby of fifteen.  Foster home?  It wouldn't be safe.  They saw that quite clearly, she had no grasp upon sanity.  By '91, the girl was in a Maryland institution for the mentally ill. <BR>
 <BR>
 (years later)-- Flash forward.  She worked at a bar in New Orleans for about three years before he came and seduced her off her feet.  Richard Kings and he gave her a ring on her finger and promised her a world of dreams come true.  He tugged her from her sanctuary of Mississippi mud and voodoo spices and housed her in his palace in Isle Voletta.  There, he left her.  A childhood friend had been discovered and it was Linna's shoulder that Rose cried on when she found herself alone and for what she registered as the second time of her life, pregnant.  Ultimately, it came out: Linna was a vampire, Rose inherited a great big pile of stuff from her father's death, and they were off to see the wizard.<BR>
 <BR>
 Modern day-  Currently the owner of Voletta's own Lyndhurst Manor, a swamp-hidden boarding house.  Somehow, her sister was alive and Denise found her way to the Isle of Veils and sat her pretty self home with everyone else.  Linna was deceased, a persistant ghost that haunted and yelled at things, and Rose adopted a little copper-curled angel named Auréle.  All's well that end's well, so the saying goes. Or something like that.<BR>
