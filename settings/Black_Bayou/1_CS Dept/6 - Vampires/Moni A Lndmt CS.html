</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>Character Name:  </B>Monique Alexandra Landermont<BR>
Raised with a strong Catholic background, she has come to depise organized religions. <BR>
Raised in the world of International Banking, and the politics involved has left her jaded.  She sees politics as the only job where people get rich lying to others.<B> </B>Monique believes that what lays in the hearts of men is the only truth.Learning and seeking knowledge in the true path of survival.  It is what she believes in totally and is forever trying to discover what lies in the hearts of men. <cue theme music of "The Shadow"><BR>
<BR>
Her experiences of being pulled from one place to another and learning what those of wealth can learn has worked on focusing her psyche.  To be constantly learning is what she strives for.  A very reserved person who her feelings hidden deep inside.  She comes across as cold and unapproachable. A believer in the supernatural, she has some reservations though.... it is actual beings or the other side of a person's soul. <BR>
Through it all Monique maintains a cool and professional demeanor when in public.  The true depth of her compassion and feelings is reserved for very few.<BR>
<BR>
Wanting to know all there is to know..Monique has started doing research into her family's past.  Pouring over pictures and what is known, she keeps coming across an ancestor named Alexander Landermont.  While looking through her Uncle's possessions, she came across a will that listed an address in the United States.  The will belonged to one Alexander Landermont.  It named one Maia Huntresse Landermont as executor of his estate, with a small portion given to the rest of the Landermont family.  Wanting to know more about this mysterious relative, she has taken a leave of absence from the French Consulate and on her diplomatic passport, granting her diplomatic immunity, she has started on her journey to Isle Voletta, Louisana. The last known place of residence for Alexander Landermont.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
