  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
  Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
  Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 turn to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Vampire is a confident creature in most situations, almost to the point of arrogance.  This confidence, when firmly believed in can strengthen the Will of the vampire, granting it a bonus of +4 Will for the rest of the scene.  This confidence is removed the moment the vampire fails any die roll for the remainder of the night, as its confidence is now shaken. This confidence is so powerful that the vampire may allow others to hit him and still not shake their ego. (Not roll to dodge)  Initiative does not count toward 'losing a die roll' for this mastery.<BR>

Generation Cost: </B>15<B> </B>/<B> Experience Cost: </B>75<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  <B>Generation cost:</B> 5 / <B>Experience Cost:</B> 25<BR>
  <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B>NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between family members, vampires have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The vampire can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance.  Each family member must have the mastery Call The Family to be included in the Mindspeak.  The family must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  By making eye contact or touching the victim, the Vampire can stoke the fires of their soul, provoking an intense obsession within them.  Whether the obsession is a person, place, thing, emotion, etc. the victim will feel strongly compelled to do whatever they can to obtain the object of the obsession.<BR>

    <B>Background:</B> From the time I was very young, it was quite apparent that my father wanted a son for his first born.  I was raised like a son - learned to play football, baseball, basketball and a few card games.  I also learned everything you could possibly want to know about cars, from makes and models and basic maintenance, to how to repair any kind of engine trouble and body work.  My father also taught me how to properly use just about every tool imaginable along with a good working knowledge of a few guns.  All the while still reminding me that I was born the wrong sex.  <BR>
    <BR>
    I excelled in high school and was accepted into the college during the summer of my junior year.  There I met my ex who taught me my second lesson about men.  It is because of him that I will never trust another man.  After supporting him for a few years, while attending college myself, I left him shortly after I received my degree and passed the boards, and have been quite happy alone ever since.  I can always get what I want from men, but they (as a general rule) have nothing that I need.  Still, I find myself hoping to run into that perfect man (<B><I>if</B></I> <I>he even exists</I>), but I am by no means looking for him - I am quite self-sufficient.<BR>
    <BR>
    Upon the death of my aunt, I moved to Louisiana and began to work with a firm here, mainly to get away from everything that I knew and use to love while at the same time being close to the spirit of my aunt.  She was considered the "black sheep" of her family because of the unusual abilities she had, and she fit in quite well with the aura of Louisiana.  I had always loved this area when I visited mostly the because of the legends associated with the area, and the special connection my aunt and I shared.  I have always been obsessed with the witchcraft and occult beings in the history of this culture and always felt an unreasoning knowledge of the things most people cannot understand.  Unfortunately, the work at this firm is not very challenging.  I often find it to be quite boring.  The south is definitely still run by men - the old boys club, but oh how I do enjoy "rocking the boat" sometimes! <BR>
