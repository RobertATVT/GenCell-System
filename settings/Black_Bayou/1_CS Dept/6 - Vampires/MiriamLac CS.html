 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 1">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

  	Miriam stands at a diminutive five foot even and weighs in at around 99 pounds. The abundance of jetten locks is cut in jagged tendrils and usually drawn back into a common upsweep, escapee strands bumbling in obstruction of water colour eyes. Paled features are chisled and delicate, a pert nose setting off the wide eyes and drawing attention away from the stubborn line of her jaw.  The hollowed sculpt of her face hints at aristocracy that mocks the diminutive and soft spoken ambiance of this tainted little seraph. <BR>

 	It</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>was a dream. The scenes that had woven their prophetic and confusing threads behind the veil of sleep the night before were being unraveled before her eyes. The veil was being torn away, and ancient eyes painted the shade of cobalt and hinting at answers to ageless questions were all that remained to watch. It was still a dream.. right? Wrong. The man was still walking towards her, the heightened glare of the sun trickling around his tall figure and glinting gold in the afternoon humidity. The click of the man's loafers against the concrete beat a steady pace to match the thud of her heart, louder and louder with each fleeting second. Somewhere beyond the abandoned playground and deep within the recesses of memory flashed another scene. Same man, sparks of autumn and gray shimmering an indelible aura around the man and another with woman at his side. A hand extended, a smile offered.. and she was back in reality, frozen in an unnerving stare at the man who had control of the sun. <BR>
  <BR>
 	Her name was Miriam, so dubbed by the nurse who assisted the doctor in ripping the child from the womb. Miriam Anne is what was scrawled on the birth certificate, no father, identity of the mother unknown - birth date January 19, 1977. That had been five years before the day Miriam first saw Benedict Halika outside of a dream, and the five years before Christine and Jacob Lacado agreed to Halika's plan. <BR>
  <BR>
 	Christine and Jacob Lacado were of the "old family". Wealths of riches scattered over half the world and recluses by their own choice. Nobody knew much about the strange couple, and nobody dared to ask. Eccentric. Scientists. Insane. Look at the company they keep. Their friends are hardly what one might call normal. So the rumors spun and grew and eventually die out as human nature averts neighbors attention elsewhere. Unfortunately human nature would never be something the Lacado's would ever be able to claim as an excuse, for Christine and Jacob had not known the pangs and pleasures of mortal coils for too many years to numerate. They were vampires, and their prestigious companion, Benedict Halika, was the psychic who ran their experimental company of "Human Advancement". <BR>
  <BR>
 	Human Advancement. That was guise given to their most recent experiment into the mind. That was name given to the operation that called for the adoption of a mortal child. Even the devil can dress up in fancy words and appear an angel beneath a confusing garble of vocabulary, and so the misshapen Charleston coven dubbed their most recent venture in science. To be honest and cast off all the excuses of scientific experimentation and that rot, it was a dare. Benedict had bet Jacob that no human child could spend time in the presence of supernatural beings such as themselves and not be scarred. Jacob had begged to differ, to put it mildly. Christine had no objections. So the plans were laid.<BR>
  <BR>
 	They selected a solemn little girl with eyes as wide and endless as the sky they would never see illuminated by the light of day again and hair the shade of the shadowed sky beneath which they live. They gave her their name and raised Miriam Anne Lacado in a world few have ever been cursed to see for even a moment. Some might say that they even loved Miriam, this wayward and macabre family that raised her at their breasts without any illusions or attempts to shield her from what they were and their nature. Though the adoption papers labeled Christine and Jacob as the parents, Miriam was not raised by them, but by the whole clan of them in the Lacado's home. <BR>
  <BR>
 	Benedict was her teacher, schooling her the arts, mathematics, history, languages, and the secrets of the mind. Her education encompassed and strayed far beyond the lines of a normal keep of knowledge. Miriam learned the details of who and what her "family" was, shards of wicked but fascinating information from all of their illusive pasts, and perhaps even of the strangest kind of love. As the years flew by, and their quiet little angel grew both physically and mentally as the only "normal" resident of the Lacado household, the fact that her entire upbringing was formed from a bet and made an experiment was forgotten and Miriam turned into a delightful young woman - despite. <BR>
  <BR>
 	Needless to say, Miriam was not exactly a normal child or a normal adult for that matter; but she is as human and humane as they come, much to the dismay of Jacob who secretly dreamed of raising a serial killer. Christine, the mother figure, was the first one to realize that their experiment had turned out quite grandly even if Miriam did have a tendency to dream. Benny, as Miriam called him, claimed it to be normal and that it could only be expected due to the surroundings in which they raised her. You see, Miriam's oddly prophetic dream as a child was indeed true. For her, Benedict, the Lacado's, and the handful of others in the so-called clan, did have control of the sun; and the sun became Miriam's secret dream. <BR>
  <BR>
 	They let her go. Watching with the considering and protective eyes of birds seeing their fledgling take to flight, they kissed their seraph good-bye. With credit cards backed by company accounts and enough cash to last for several months, they watched their daughter walk away. With tainted tears and hopeful, wicked smiles, they gave their experiment time in the sun. And Miriam Lacado chose a small town with a whimsical name as the place in which to watch it rise. Isle Voletta, Louisiana. <BR>
