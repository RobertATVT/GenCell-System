  <B>Healing - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (no room command needed)</B><BR>
 <B> System/Duration:</B>  NA / NA<BR>
 <B> Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds from sunlight, holy water or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour only when the character sleeps.  If  the character is woken up before the hour is over, the healing process is disrupted and the hour starts over.  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the Forum Director.)<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Mindspeak - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
 <B> System/Duration</B>:  NA/NA<BR>
 <B> Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
  <BR>
 <B> Night Vision - 0 XP - 0 Soul  </B> (no room command needed)<BR>
  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B> Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Bat Form - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
 <B> System/Duration: </B> NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 <B> Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively can not see.  It uses active sonar<BR>
   to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form.<BR>
  <BR>
  *(Just a quick note about shapechanging (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, a minimum of 1 Body)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trance-like state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occured after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Duration:</B>  The vampire is a confident creature in most situations, almost to the point of arrogance.  This confidence, when firmly believed in, can strengthen the will of the vampire, granting them a +4 to their Will for the rest of the scene.  This confidence is removed the moment the vampire fails any die roll for the remainder of the night, as its confidence is now shaken. This confidence is so powerful that the vampire may allow others to hit him and still not shake their ego. (Not roll to dodge)  Initiative does not count toward 'losing a die roll' for this mastery.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; this mastery takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the vampire posses a supernatural quickness which allows it to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the vampire, as the beast within them has turned to its instincts, not human reaction.  This mastery adds +3 to all defensive rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

<B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.   They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Over time, the vampire can learn to expand and direct the nature of its inner beast during times of stress.  This monstrous energy can then be directed toward the vampire's physical form, causing the beast form of a vampire to emerge.  In vamporos form the vampire's body expands beyond the bounds of its human shape.  The vampire becomes massive, standing nearly eight feet tall.  Its body is skeletal, any clothes the vampire wore would be ripped and hanging loosely from its body.  The face elongates sharply from forehead to chin and cheek to cheek.  The vampire's eyes shrink to mere slits, the pupils glowing an eerie red.  Wicked gleaming fangs hang below the bottom lip and the nails harden into sharp claws.  The vampire's mind explodes with anger and passion, almost completely overriding rational thought.  It can formulate simple thoughts and speak crude, guttural English (or other language depending on its homeland).  Vampires can feed normally in this form.  While in this form, the vampire gains +2 Body. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Inheriting their fortune, millionaires of their own making, and the money which her maternal grandparents had left to her, also extreme wealth, (old money).  Angell, a scared lonely girl inside, a beautiful, intelligent woman outside, fled to the old country.
