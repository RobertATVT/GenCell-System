 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

  	Tristan Johansen- he was born in Arizona nearly fourty-two years ago, and does not look a day over thirty due to the wonderful discovery of make-up..    A man with a scottish background, his family moved to Scotland when he was very small, hence the accent.  For many years he lived there unabashed and unscathed.  He had a lover, Isa, who was to have his child Ryan when he was only 19.  His parents, Margarete and John, approved of Isabella to the fullest.  It was not expected when Isa disappeared with the knowlegde of being pregnant.   It was only then that Tristan lost the love he had.  He lost it the night the man came to him, the night Isa ran away with their child, the night his parents were slaughtered by something he does not understand..<BR>
   	Tristan went on.  He made it back to the Americasnearly ten years later, where he set to work as an asassin for a certain DeLuise, and Mina as well.  His work led him to Voletta many years later, as he was told to kill a certain Devorah Beuregarde, former DeLuise.  The job he never accomplished and the work was abandoned.  He began his work of odd jobs and such.  Tristan was taken, only to escape later... and find himself looking for the culprits who took his sanity.  He stands at a rough 6'4', his hair disheveled locks of sand, his eyes a steely gray, his build moderate.  His lips can always be found in a childish grin, except when he is angered(which is sometimes often) when it turns to a fatal smirk.  He chooses to wear casual khakis and a loose silken shirt, his normal hue obsidian.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
