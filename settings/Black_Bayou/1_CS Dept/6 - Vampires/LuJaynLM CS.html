<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>What a sight.  Small and inconsequential, so they tell her.  Barely below 5'4, always rounded up of course, with short hair of a chocolate brown, cut into a sleek few layers just above the line of thin shoulders, and blown straight.  Always tumbling into large, rounded eyes.  A streak of self-fabricated platinum lances through the murky locks of mud-puddle hue, only lightening a few strands that shadow the left side of her face.  Eyes are big, rimmed by thick, dark brown lashes; their hue is a muddled mixture of blue skies, green grass, and gray smog, always mistaken for some other color at any given moment.  And yes, she wears leather.  Gripping leather pants, a subtle boot-cut flaring to whisper cuffs against thick, steel-toed boots laced by thin chains that jingle and sing with each scraping step.  A plain white t-shirt clings to her upper body, sometimes hidden beneath a sweater when the weather calls for it. <BR>

  <BR>
       Misunderstood, of course.  Aren't they all.  Children of the streets, or something.  Gutter toys, and alley homes.. they always joke about the cardboard boxes.  Public school is free.  So she went.  What's worse.. public education, or having no parents to complain about it?  They say Susan and Edward Bishop were alive at one point, so it wasn't as if she fell out of the sky.  Or perhaps she did.  Maybe all her talk of flying without wings really meant more than just the magic she made.  And she did make magic.  Whithout parents, then, her magic was all she had.  Mary Bishop and Emil Bishop took over her life at age 3.  Irish Catholic grandparents who believed in whiskey, potatoes, and Notre Dame.<BR>
  <BR>
       So what happened next?  It's all a blurr, really.  You feed them, you water them, and like weeds, they grow up.  Grandmom Bishop always said so.  That, and she claimed that Liza was always too short, and dark.  She should have been blond like, well.. no Bishop had ever been blond.  Edward should have married a nice, tall blond lady.  The point is: he didn't.  And they got Elizabeth.  What a horrendous name, too.  Elizabeth Bishop.  How dreadfully dull and Irish and unflattering.  She always wanted to be named Melanie.  Or Maxine.  M names were nice.  But, no, she was Elizabeth.  But they called her Liza.  They.  Horrible kids, grandmom Bishop would say.  Rabble.  A motley crue of undesirables, and her granddaughter had been sucked into their world, their fantasy, their adventure.  It had always been an adventure for her.  Like flying and magic and Yoda and Ernest Hemmingway.  She wanted to be a drunk Jedi knight with wings in Paris.  Well, something along those lines, anyway.<BR>
  <BR>
       Grandmom Bishop never did find out about the robberies.  The theft.  The money.  And the death.  Who knew Liam would lose his cool this time, and who could've guessed that Joey the Jackle would take a cop's bullet.  Who knew.  She knew.  All the signs where there, all the warnings, all the red flags went up this time.  But damned if she'd had enough time to open her mouth.  They would have listened if she had, they always listened.  Everyone listened when she spoke, such a rareity that it was, and so elegantly put.  She thought first, though.  Thinking took up precious seconds and those seconds were all it took to pull the trigger.  She'd never actually pulled one of those triggers, it always just sat there and looked threatening against the palm of her hand.  Bank robbers aren't supposed to kill people, they just get their money.  She had been caught in one of those shoot-em-up hollywood blockbuster's... the bad guys always get their heads blown off at the end.  She was only 17, but life had slammed her behind the counter of that First Union, a sawed-off shotgun clenched in her trembling hands, and she had suddenly become the badguy.  Shoes she would never get off her feet.<BR>
  <BR>
       Where does one go from here.  Down, she supposed.  Grandmom Bishop didn't last past her 18th birthday, and Grandpop was playing golf when his pacemaker gave out.  Tough life.  Eh, who needs college.  The South was abandoned with a wink of one hazel-hued eye, and social securty checks payed her way to Paris.  Hemmingway wrote in Paris; she would steal.  He was a drunk, though, and she wasn't planning on commiting suicide any time soon.  <BR>
  <BR>
       It was another four years before she came back to the Western hemisphere.  Why bother.  She had mastered the arts of burglary and thievery, thanks to the careful tutilage of one Louis Merteuil (she met him while attempting to pick is pocket).  After Louis, she began working full-time for the Parisian crime lord Jaume Malavoy.. occasionally moonlighting with Louis, of course.  When she was 21 she reappeared in the states, a thief known simply as the Bishop.  Elizabeth Bishop had fallen off the face of the earth by now, or so she had thought.<BR>
  <BR>
       Now 22, and the Paris underworld's best kept secret, Liza has recieved a phone call from one Gary-called-Gannet.  Get your [  ] to Isle Voletta, Lousiana.  Now.  No time to think now, Bishop.  Just fly.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
