System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

Loosely coiled tendrils of autumnal silk spill arrent over cotton-draped shoulders, locks of a darkest wine streaked by the occasional thread of sunfire woven into their strands.  The musician's eyes collect the hues of a lush rainforest, deep and a darkening green save for the pupils' edges where a dust of dirty smoke has stained them gray.  Despite the wide, observative nature of her gaze, and the smile often curving full, rosie lips.. the woman seems to remain in a state of detached understanding.  Watch, please..and understand.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></I>       Emma Thayne was born on a January evening 21 years ago.  She was born deaf.  Her parents, Magdelena and Gregory Thayne didn't learn of her affliction until she was two years old.  They considered themselves blessed with a child who never cried.. yet, oddly enough, never cooed or laughed.  When the doctor proclaimed her deaf, it sent them into shock.  They tried every way possibly to prove that she could hear their voices, the sounds they made.. but nothing worked.  Instead of having to live with a child so detached from all they knew, they sent her to a live-in school for the deaf/mute.  She grew up in a place not her home, she skipped down halls painted a stale gray instead of the violet she dreamed of, and she went on smiling despite the silence inherent to her gaze.  She learned to draw pictures in the air as a means of communication, sign language, as they called it.  She learned like any other student, through reading and writing and understanding.  She learned to read lips quickly, and when she got older, received a hearing aide.  The hearing aide enabled her to learn the simplest vowels an consonants, providing her with a semblence of broken speech.  But she hated this tool, she hated the look in people's eyes as they attempted to understand her words.  And found that drawing her air pictures was much easier.  She became an interpreter for deaf children when she turned 18, and she'd only seen her parents a total of ten times her entire life.  She assumed that all families were this way.  Afterall, the stories were all the same in the school where she lived.  <BR>
        After her 18th birthday, she moved out of the school and found an apartment.  She had learned to play the piano at The School, but it had never occured to her that she could play anywhere else.  The apartment she'd rented came furnished, complete with an old, worn piano who's chords were slightly out of tune.  But it was a piano.  Her fingers descended upon the ivory of its keys, following the vibrations delt by the strumming chords as the checkerboard of its notes fell beneath her imagination.  She could not hear the beauty of its song, but she could feel it; she could imagine it, and make it a reality.<BR>
       She moved through life in this way.  She maintained work at the school as an interpreter, and played concerts in the evenings for a crowd who left shivering from the lingering sounds of her music.  An each time they approached to relay a compliment, the pianist's hands would lift, crooking and twisting in a dance of humble acceptance. "Don't thank me, just enjoy my gift", she would sign.  And someone who had been to more than one concert would arrive by her side, and translate as best they could to the newcomer.  That is how she taught the ignorant.  Through generosity, and patience.  She knew that every sign made sense when people bothered to watch.  So, please, watch.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

       A small school for disabled children recently opened in a small town off the coast of Louisiana.  They need helpers badly, and the now 21 Emma has decided to stop in and offer her services to those who need it.<BR>
