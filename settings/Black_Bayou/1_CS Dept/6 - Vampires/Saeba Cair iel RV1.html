</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#030000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

Clothed in the typical faded jeans and black, fitted leather jacket.  She just sat in the booth, green eyes roaming over the crowd, a long finger tapping lightly upon her glass, and I wanted to approach her, but I thought I might be intruding.  She seemed to be studying people.  I allowed my own eyes to drift over her.  She was attractive, though nothing I would have oggled for too long, had I not seen her eyes.  There was definitely something behind those jade pools, hooded by the smoky lashes.  Serene was the word that first popped into my head, but as I watched her something sparked behind them.  I was sure there was a storm somewhere behind those eyes.  Her hair was caught up in a loose ponytail.  Blonde.  And she seemed to shove lose strands back with an annoyed ferocity.  They were interrupting her studying.  I took a lazy sip of the beer I had been nursing for near an hour and looked back up to see another gentleman approach her table, bending down to whisper something into her ear.  As he straightened, she just stared at him, elongated, almost delicate features turned up toward him, expressionless.  And then she smiled.  I almost dropped my beer.  Just a moment ago I was sitting there watching a fairly ordinary looking woman, and now? Now, she was beautiful, the transformation her smile brought spreading across her face like a sunrise peeking slowly over the horizon.  I watched her shake her head at the man and him shrug and turn away.  I scrambled to my feet, struggling to pull my jaw off the floor and headed in her direction.  At that moment I didn't care if I was interrupting, nor did I care that she had just rejected someone else.  After that smile, I had to meet this woman."<BR>

	I suppose you could say I had a normal childhood, whatever we deem normal to be.  I remember someone telling me once that normal was only in our own minds-our own secret worlds.  I don't know much about that, but I do know that there was never anything monumental in my upbringing.<BR>
	I was born in Kildare, Ireland in October of 76, not an exceptionally exciting year, in and of itself, but then again nothing, since that moment I shoved my little wrinkled face into the world screaming, has ever been what you could call exciting.  I lived in Ireland until I was 16.  Upon the arrival of puberty, I watched everything change around me.  My parents made the decision to drag me from Ireland to the US so they could pursue their non-existent careers, and I, young, wide-eyed and scared, packed all of their belongings and hauled them into the station wagon, looking back the whole time, mourning my departure from my homeland.<BR>
	My parents?  Well, let's just say that they were star crazy.  Maybe crazy isn't quite the word.  No, obsessed is more like it.  Both of them were, and still are as far as I know, struggling thespians.  I watched them, from the time I could walk, on stage.  Watched them sing, dance, and try, in vain mind you, to act.  I was taught at an early age that you never interrupted mummy and papa's rehearsal time, not if you needed a hug, not if you needed medical attention.  I, of course, was taught the basics of stage movement, acting, singing and dancing, but I soon found myself helping with sets, costumes, make up, what have you, and before long was in charge of it all.  My parents always told me I added so much to the background.<BR>
	So on to the US we traveled, moving frequently for the years to come.  Memories from that point are scattered and shady.  I found myself constantly in the shadows of my parents who still did small shows together, and tried to make enough money to support the three of us.  At the age of 20, seeing that my life was doomed to carry on this way until the end of time, I left-left everything that was comfortable and went to find something that up until that point had eluded me, still unsure as to what that "something" might be.<BR>
	Of course, as young, impressionable people tend to do, I fell in with a bad crowd immediately, had a few runs in with the law and finally, after about a year and a half, moved on.  I ended up in Isle Voletta, somehow, someway.  I couldn't tell you, really, why I am here.  I have tried to analyze it endlessly, but I suppose I am still looking for that "something".  That something that will make my heart race and my tongue tie itself into tiny knots.  I am tired of being normal.  I think I may be ready for some excitement.<BR>
