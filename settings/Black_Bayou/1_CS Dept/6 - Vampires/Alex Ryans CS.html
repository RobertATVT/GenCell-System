</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

	Alexander Andrew Ryan is a 26 year old computer programmer.  Born to Jonathan and Amy, on November 14, 1972, in Dallas Texas.  Alex spent much of his childhood living in Dallas and then later Houston.  As a child growing up Alex already had a thing for computers.  From the first Main Frame at the Military base that his father was stationed at, to the first personal computer made by Apple that his parents bought him for one of his birthdays, all the way to the numerous laptops, desktops, palmtops that he has acquired.  <BR>
	Most of his childhood consisted of sitting in front of his computer and writing small programs to do various things, everything from bringing up a message when he started up his computer to a full security system for his computer that would lock the computer up and cause the computer's hard drive to fill up with useless information then reformat itself should someone try to access what was on it.  Once he entered high school things changed a bit.  He got into hacking and breaking into secure systems.  He managed to acquired well over two million dollars from various funds.  He took as many computer classes as was offered and quickly excelled in what he could do with programming.  From there he moved up to Rochester, New York for college and attended the Rochester Institute of Technology.  There he acquired a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Masters in Computer Programming.  <BR>
	Soon after his college years, at the age of 23, Alex found himself working for the LA Police Department as a computer programmer for the various computer systems they had there.  Having written almost half the code himself he knew almost every back door and code there was to the system.  With his previous experience as a hacker back in high school he managed to hide those back doors from almost any hacker that might have wanted to try with exception to a few of the big guys.  <BR>
	After his year with the LA Police Department the FBI snatched him out to work on updating their systems and to tighten security.  Working with a much larger team now he had less access to the systems and only knew of a few minor back doors that wouldn't take him very far.  Slowly moving up the ranks he finally achieved the position of Security Programming Director in April of 1999.  Shortly after he was given this position he had to leave the Bureau for personal reasons.<BR>
	Alex has been living in New Orleans since May 19, 1999.  He arrived in New Orleans at that time when his Father and Mother had been in a car accident.  His father died shortly after arriving at the hospital, his mother however remains still in a coma in New Orleans.  Having found a job in New Orleans at the moment he resides there.  With the recommendation of a friend he has come to Voletta to scope it out and possibly find himself a home down here away from the big city, but still within driving distance so he can still be there when his mother comes out of her coma.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
