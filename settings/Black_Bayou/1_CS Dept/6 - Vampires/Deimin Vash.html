 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trance-like state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occured after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Deimin was born in San Antonio Texas.  His father, Shane, is the Executive Lawyer for TLM Assoc.  His mother, Sofai, is a mother of 5 and a full time house wife.  Deimin has 1 brother and 3 sisters.  His sister Breana is the eldest.  Last time he knew she was an entrance level engineer at a local firm.  Next in line is Ian, his brother.  He was not one who took to school much.  After high school Ian got a job as a supervisor at a local department store.  Deimin is the 3rd eldest.  He was very interested in education his whole life.  All through out high school he made high honors.  He graduated 4th in his class.  His sister Alenia is 2 years younger then he is.  She to was a fine student and has done well in school.  His other sister Serba has been a "rebel", she like many other teenagers these days has clung onto the wrong track.<BR>
   	After high school Deimin moved ou tot California, where he attended Berkley.  He was majoring in Law.  Durring his sophmore year he met a young woman by the name of Gabrielle Sutcliffe ((Gabrlls)).  She too was enrolled in the Law program there at Berkly.  They became very close and started dating.  They were going out for well over a year when things started to change.  He began to see less of her and spend more times away.  He was seldom home and was doing poorly in school.  Then near the end of is junior year he left a note for Gaaby that he was going away and wouldn't be back for a while.  He had disapeared and she was confused, hurt and lonely.  No one knew where he was...all his belongings were still in his apartment and he had not told anyone where he was going.<BR>
   	He had met up with a young woman that went by the name Alexa Sabathie.  They had met and had been seeing a lot of each other...She had controll over and him...something her couldn't help.  He had a bond with her...a blood bond.  She was a vampire that had ghouled him and casue a blood bond to be formed.  He was under her controll and was forced to do what she said.  She had decided to go to Russia for a while and bring him along.  He spent many years there with her and continued to be under her controll.  While there he began to learn about the vampire and how they lived.  He got to see first hand how they were.  He also became addicted to her blood and could not leave even if he wanted to anymore...he needed her blood to survive.  Soon she became aggitated with him and sent him back to the United States alone.  <BR>
   	Without anyone to turn to, and no where to go he became a citizen of the streets.  He found work were he can and sought out vampires to give him the blood that he desired.  After living on the streets for well over a year he heard from a young man that Knew Gabby that she was living down in Isle Voletta, Louisiana.  Without anywere else to go, and no one to turn to, he decided to travel there and try to find her......</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
