 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B><I>Lore Level 1:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>  </B></I>You have watched many horror movies.  You believe ordinary crosses and cloves of garlic will ward a vampire off.  You think they can not cross running water and they will cast no reflection.  A stake through the heart or the rays of the sun is all you need to kill them.  They have super strength and unnatural quickness.  Some can fly like a bird while others can shape change into a variety of animals.  All a vampire needs to do is bite you to turn you into one of them.  They never get sick, they never grow old and they can never die... naturally.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B><I>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></I> You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of vampires.  Having read everything at the local booksellers, to the more arcane legends, you believe you know the truth.  You know that regular, unblessed stakes merely paralyze a vampire.  Sunlight seriously injures a vampire, as well as fire.  You know which myths from level 1 are, in fact, myths and which are not.  Having studied vampires for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a vampire uses a mastery within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 18.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you +3 to any resistance rolls (masteries requiring Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; can not be used while in direct combat).<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A>.)<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 turn to activate<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   <BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround<BR>
    itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeting for attacks.  They may not be seen, but they may be smelled or heard.  Casting light directly at the vampire will destroy its shadows.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 Rounds or 2 Minutes; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and speaking softly, a vampire can lull its victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  For example, the vampire can lull a victim into willingly allowing the vampire to feed from them.  The command should be carefully phrased as a witty target could twist the<BR>
    command around if there are any loopholes.  The victim will remember everything that happens, but will not be sure why they took those actions (unless they have Vampire Lore Level 2 or higher and succeed in their Lore roll).  If the victim takes any damage, they are instantly snapped out of this mind controlling effect.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire can not feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.<BR>

  Born on 26 June, 1971 in Paris, France to the famille du Lac.  She was the youngest in the family, the only daughter.  Adored by her father, loved deeply by her mother, and over time would come to treasure the relationship between Pierre, her brother, and herself.  In 1978, her mother and father died.  Both had been vampire hunters, and on one night, a fire raged through their summer home.  The last sight she had of her parents was their smoldering corpses as her brother tugged her from the flames.  Having no other family left, she and Pierre were placed in the care of their only remaining relative, their father's brother; Renee' du Lac.  It was in this moment that she knew that the life her father led was to be the one that she would also carry out.  Her life from that point was one that molded her into the person she was when she first stepped onto the isle.  She graduated from Sorbonne, obtaining a degree in psychology, then moved on to the final step of her evolution as a hunter.   Years passed, and in late 1990 she met the man that she would marry in late 1994; William Baird.  Their marriage was short lived, as it often is when those that share the lifestyle they did commit.  The death of her husband caused her only to become more cold, more distant than she had ever been.  Wrapped in arrogance, she strode onward with her head held high, and moved to Italy where she join a circle that had worked closely with her family.<BR>
  In late September of last year (96) she was sent on holiday to Louisiana and to Ile Voletta.  Much to her dismay, she was found by one Remy Thorne, and in her mind damned with the worst curse she could ever hope to endure by being made into his childe.<BR>
