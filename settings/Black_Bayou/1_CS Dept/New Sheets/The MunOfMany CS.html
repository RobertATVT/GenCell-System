  System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
  Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
  Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
  Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Generation cost: </B>5 /<B> Experience Cost:</B> 25<B><BR>
System/Duration:</B>  roll<B> </B>2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> A werewolf shares its acute sense of hearing with its wolf cousins.  A werewolf can overhear even the quietest conversation in the noisiest room, so long as they are paying attention.  When the werewolf player mentions to the room that their character is concentrating on a spoken conversation, they are assumed to be able to hear it perfectly.  This is only true when the conversationalists are within view.  If the conversing people begin to whisper (i.e. <w>), the werewolf then makes the roll above.  If the succeed, the conversation is heard, even if they say <wvvvvvvvvq> (whispers very, very, very, very, very (etc.), quiet).  If there is a loud noise nearby (ST discretion) while this mastery is in use, the werewolf is rendered deaf for 4 rounds / 2 minutes and the effects of this mastery end immediately.<BR>
