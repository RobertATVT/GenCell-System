<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

You've learned all that is truth about these "gifted" individuals.  When a psychic uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  It matters not if you know the characters breed - your mind will still attempt to defend itself from attack, even though your physical self had no realization of the process.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the psychic use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><I><U>Sight Recognition</B></I></U>: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>There are two methods of identifying a Psychic by sight.  Not the identity of the person, but the identity of the breed.  Only through long hours of study (and the prerequisite Lore level 3) are these methods possible.  The first is by physically seeing the true form of the Psychic, which happens to be Psychical.  If you wish to identify the Psychical as a breed, roll 2d6 + Mind vs. TN 14.  If the roll is successful, you have gathered enough knowledge to understand that you are actually looking at a Psychic, and not some illusion of the eyes.  The second method is by observing the Psychic transform either to or from Psychical.  If this is physically witnessed and there is a Room Host, ST or GM, the observer automatically recognizes what others may think of as 'swamp gas' or 'light flashes' as a Psychic.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><I><U>Crystal Water:</B></I></U> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> Crystal water is little more than water mixed with a finely crushed rose quartz crystal and black rose petals.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough crystal water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the psychic with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of crystal water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the psychic are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the psychic suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The psychic must heal the damage as any normal mortal would, except at twice the normal rate.  That would mean each point of damage would take 6 days to heal rather than 3.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the psychic heal faster at the maximum rate of normal healing speed.  Crystal water wounds cause disfiguring scars that will eventually heal after a months time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

You may believe that lamia are evil, lapdogs of Satan.  You may believe they are evil, shrewd old ladies who ride brooms off into the night.  Perhaps you understand the difference between white and black magic.  Thoughts of zombies and voodoo dolls come to mind as well as potions and cauldrons.  Lamia are known to be able to shift into the forms or Ravens and Black Cats.  According to legend, lamia can't abide the touch of salt.  They work their magic secretly and sometimes almost too obviously.  Lamia tend to stick together in Covens, if they aren't off by themselves.  One thing is for sure.  With the right combination of words and ingredients, there is nothing a Lamia can't do.<BR>

You believe ordinary crosses and cloves of garlic will ward a vampire off.  You think they can not cross running water and they will cast no reflection.  A stake through the heart or the rays of the sun is all you need to kill them.  They have super strength and unnatural quickness.  Some can fly like a bird while others can shape change into a variety of animals.  All a vampire needs to do is bite you to turn you into one of them.  They never get sick, they never grow old and they can never die... naturally.<BR>

You believe silver bullets are needed to kill a werewolf. You believe them to be creatures of the night who change into a horrific beast by the light of a full moon. You believe there are physical signs of the werewolf (unibrow, fingers of the same length, etc.) You believe they cannot touch silver objects. You are wary of the dreaded bite of the werewolf, as you still believe a random bite will do to curse you as well.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> A few Psychics have found another way to use mindspeak.  By increasing the telepathic flow toward a subject, they can over load their mind.  If this is kept up, or if it is powerful enough, then the target may eventually fall unconscious.  This buildup causes intense feedback, like white noise dealing 5 points of Mind damage.  Due to the great mental force and Psychic energy put into the attack, a Psychic may not perform any masteries the round following a Mental Blast.  The victim must be within line of sight.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By concentrating on an object for a few moments, the psychic is able to focus his inner strength, lifting and moving the object.  The difficulty of such feats depends on the object being lifted.  Objects may only be lifted and moved.  Guns cannot be made to fire with only the mind, however, you could "summon" the gun to your hand, and then fire.  The player may move any object about.  There is not enough control to use this to attack someone.  For example, with a knife.  The distance moved per round is 10 yards.  TN's are:  For every ten pounds (rounded up) the object weighs, increase the difficulty by two from a base of 20.  Thus a 15 pound object would require a TN of 22, while a 64 pound object would require a TN of 34.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> The Psychic has learned to create a small burst of force with their power.  This is harnessed and directed at a victim.  Once the roll succeeds, an invisible force slams into the victim causing 1 point of damage to the victim's Body.  The victim must be within line of sight.  If the psychic wins the roll contest by more than 5 points, the victim is knocked to the ground.  Any character on the ground suffers -4 to all physical rolls unless they have the Wrestling fighting skill.  This mastery may not be used on inanimate objects.<I><BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> What is it about psychics that seem to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, not highest.  The mortal can only enact this mastery once per scene.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Josephine is a 6 foot brunette/blonde with enchanting eyes that change colors with the seasons.  Her flirtatious appearance goes well with her lifestyle. She is very casual and shows it by mostly wearing some jeans and a tank top. She is always quite layed back and calm that helps her write songs and music. She wears her golden brown hair down in long flowing curls or in a simple ponytail. In her spare time she hangs at the beach to work on her tan, swims laps at the YMCA, writes songs, hangs out at the Symposium Night club, performs at the Lunar Bluez cafe, or hangs out with her friends. She models for an MMI company called Model THIS and goes to shoots every other week. She has been priviledged to model Gap wear, and even modeled some for Fredericks. She never takes off her necklace that has a silver star on it, which is the source of her Psychic powers. She has a small tatoo on her femininly perfect body, on her lower back with the design of a small blue moon and a golden yellow shooting star.<BR>
