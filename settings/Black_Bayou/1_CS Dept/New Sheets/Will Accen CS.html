The prophets of our generation, some mean well, while some don't.  But they have a unique power over us, the gift to sway us, to tell us anything they want to and somehow make us actually believe it.  It's a good thing they're on our side.  They are on our side...right?<BR>

<B>Advantage:</B>  Religious Leaders hold an incredible sway over the community.  Many people hold a solid belief that Religious Leaders can do no wrong.  Obviously this reputation can be tarnished, but until it does, a Religious Leader is almost always believed over someone who is accusing them.  The religious leader receives a +3 to any roll involving their Theology skill.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human soul is known to manifest itself during desperate times of need.  During times of intense fear or when faith is the only thing they have left, mortals tend to reach deep down into places they didn't even know existed and harnessing this energy from everything that makes them mortal.  As a result, the player may add +8 to the next Faith roll their character makes (only applies when a the Faith skill is used).  This mastery may only be used once per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Appearance (clothes, etc.):  His "preaching clothes" are a suit and tie.  The suits vary in range from a dark woolen one for winter in the unheated church to a white one for summers in the un-cooled church.  His congregation consists mainly of blacks, though he is white.  A pair of suspenders are always on under the suit and tie.  His hair is kept short, and in nice shape, combed back in good style.  He stays clean-shaven 24 hours a day, and keeps himself in good hygiene.<BR>
	<BR>
	When not helping the congregation, his dress consists of an old t-shirt and one of many pairs of old jeans.   This shows off three things that he normally likes to hide...<BR>
		A "Hell's Fire, 31st Air Cav" Tattoo featuring a skull and helicopter on his upper right arm.<BR>
<BR>
		A long pink scar on his left forearm.<BR>
<BR>
		And a name, carved into his upper-right bicep.  It's his own name.  Accen.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>He was born in Louisianna.  More specifically, he was born in New Orleans.  His father was a Marine and his mother was a SeaBee.  The military family lived happily, except that young Will was growing up to be a problem.  Despite the fact that the family normally attended the non-denominational church on the base, Will was without guidance or remorse for almost all of his actions.  It wasn't exactly easy to be a military teen either.  When he hit 16 in 1962, his father more or less shipped him off to his grandmother's.<BR>
<BR>
	Even this failed to help the troubled youth.  He became a well known trouble-maker in small Tennessee community.  He spent more time in lock-up in those two years tghan in school...but somehow he graduated.<BR>
<BR>
	By this time, his father had made a name for himself in AirCav.  And there was no choice....Will enlisted.  With prodding and beatings from his Full Colonel father, he made 2nd Lt. and was assigned to the 31st...shortly before America became involved in the Vietnam War.  It was shortly before he shipped off that he met and married the woman that would be his future wife.<BR>
<BR>
	His record during the war was exemplary.  He even managed to make Captain.  However, his recorded land kills came not from enemies, but rather from small rice-paddy villages.  He was a maniacal pilot, willing to shoot anything and everything that moved in front of his twin guns.  His crew soon became known as "Hell's Fire", a quote used by the regiment chaplan when describing the destination of these 4 men.<BR>
<BR>
	It all came back to him.<BR>
<BR>
	The Chopper was shot down by a small Vietcong force over a village one day.  The bad luck was that they had just torn up the small village, and when he was fished out of the paddy, they attacked.  Over 50 of the people he had just shot at beat the flight crew mercilessly.  One managed to crudely carve the letters on his flight patch into his bicep.  Another unsuccessfully slit his wrists.  By the time the NVA got there, two of his three other flight members were dead at the hands of the villagers.  His machine-gunner, an enlisted man, was dragged off to a prison.  Will was taken to a seperate camp.<BR>
<BR>
	He was released shortly afterwards, when the NVA found out his father was now heading up many of the AirCav Regiments in the area.  It was part of a deal cut.  He was brought quietly home, and nursed back to health. Not by his wife, but rather by a local minister.  His wife had left him, filing for divorce the same day he set foot on American soil.<BR>
<BR>
	So the natural solution was to turn to the bottle.  At this point, it was 1974, and he was approaching 30.  The images flooded back to him, the looks on the faces that he gunned down as he made low passes.  Until one night when he made a suicide attempt.  In a dingy Los Angeles hotel room, he slit one of his wrists.  He later managed to drive himself to the ER.  And was referred to a help group.  The help group was located in a church.<BR>
<BR>
	He went for one group..and one sermon...and at the age of 35, he went to the seminary.  <BR>
<BR>
	And at the age of 50, he found himself at the Voletta Southern Baptist Church.  Assigned by the Southern Baptist Convention, he's spent the last four years raising membership.  Now it was time to try his luck...<BR>
