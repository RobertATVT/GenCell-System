Your Occupation is different, so I Updated it. Also, your Mind Stat is a 6, and your Music Skill was a 7. Since Music is based off of Mind, it can't be higher than the Stat. So I took it back down to 6 and refunded you the XP in your XP Record. Sorry for the changes . . . you should be good to go now.<BR>

</B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

<B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration: 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate <BR>
Effect/Description:  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  For the Psychic to keep this mastery in effect, they must continue to concentrate.  This means no movement quicker than a slow walk, and no other masteries may be performed.  The Psychic can speak, but if physically attacked, the concentration is broken.  <BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Body+Basic Medical Skill vs TN 18 / Ends play for the night; takes the rest of the night to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some Psychics learn to control their bodies through extensive training of the mind by entering a trance like state.  They have learned how to increase the body's metabolism, thus causing them to heal at a quicker rate.  For every point above 18, 1 point of body is regained.  This cannot exceed the psychics max body score.  Due to the draining effect of this mastery, and the state the Psychic must enter, this must be the last thing the Psychic does for the night.  If the Psychic is interrupted in ANY way, then the effects for the night are lost, and the mastery cannot be performed again until the following night.  A room host must be present for this mastery.  The TN is 18 if used in conjunction with the Major Medical Skill.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between friends, psychics have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The psychic can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its psychic friends <g> as one, regardless of distance.  Each psychic friend must have the mastery Call The Circle to be included in the Mindspeak.  The circle must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will+Basic Medical Skill vs TN 24 / Instant; takes 2 rounds per point healed to use this mastery.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The Psychic ability to heal through the placement of hands over the injured part of the body.  The hands usually grow very warm.  In some instances, the healer exhibits the wounds or symptoms of the disease or wound, until they sleep it off.  This mastery can be used to heal wounds during combat, however, the player's actions for the necessary number of rounds (see above) is the "laying on hands".  If successful, the target will regain 1 Body point per point over 24.  For every 2 points the target receives, the Psychic will receive 1 Mind damage as the healing drains his mental faculties.  This mastery can only be used on another person, the Psychic cannot perform it on themselves.  If the Psychic takes another action during combat, before duration is over, healing has stopped.  The TN is 20 if used with the Major Medical Skill.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Gives the psychic the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The psychic may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The psychic may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  They are only a spectator.  The psychic may ask 3 questions in an instant message of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.   This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed, unless they are thinking about their breed at the time.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Obvious physical depletion greets you: cheeks have paled, abandoning the former blush, though it's still found in places. Hair, in slack autumn toned waves, has been cut off, but not recently; by now, it hangs almost to the slim shoulders, which are thinner now than ever. The figure, however tried, still moves with her old delicate grace; a sometimes-naive enthusiasm for life exudes, sticking a sparkle in hazel eyes. (Ht/Wt: 4'10 1/2"/ 87 lbs)<BR>
Generally, she dresses simply, with little jewelery (a gull-shaped pendant and Irish wedding band). Denim jeans cling and sag around the hinted curve of hip; long sleeves are almost a constant, if, in warmer weather, over a t-shirt. Birkenstocks, with worn soles, are worn barefoot even in cooler weather.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Laih was born December 31, 1979 in Killallee, Northern Ireland, to a family of political activists. Her mother, Renny, who was mentally ill, left the family in 1984, later committing suicide. A woman, elderly, by the name of Aileen Sine, took it upon herself as a God-given duty to watch after the kids. It was this lady who taught Laih about all aspects of psychicness, many of which are now forgotten, but were, at one point, strong. Her younger brother, Timothy, was killed during a protest; Shawn, the eldest, escaped with a bullet in his knee. Shawn and the father still reside in the fishing port. She went to college early (sixteen) for psych and music, but later decided that neither of these would do much good (rather, that she didn't really want to be a psychiatrist), and dropped out. Laih worked as a musician and, more surreptitiously, an assassin, in Ireland (Piano, guitar, and vocal) before immigrating, with her sister, to the United States in March of 1998. In early April of the same year, she moved to Isle Voletta and began mentoring "students" in anticipation of eventually forming a linked group -- unfortunately, this became an impossibility. After a miscarriage of the baby she was carrying, Laih's sanity slipped a little. Careless, she allowed herself to be "caught." Almost completely drained by the vampire (of course, she doesn't know he was a vampire), she was mistaken as being dead at an extremely cursory examination performed by a coroner who also happened to be the local funeral director. As she wasn't yet a naturalized citizen, and looked very dead, it wasn't questioned. Later on, the accelerated healing kicked in, and, obviously, she didn't get embalmed. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <BR>
