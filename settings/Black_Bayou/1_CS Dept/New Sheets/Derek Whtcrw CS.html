They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<BR>
Breed:  Wolf <BR>
Wolf Sire:  Evan Walker <EvnWalker><BR>
Born:  July 17, 1976<BR>
Occupation:  Texas Ranger<BR>
Derek Whitecrow was born in Sundance, Wyoming to George Whitecrow and his wife Mary Little Bear Whitecrow.  One of seven children, George worked in Pine Bluffs, Wyoming at the local grainary.  His wife was a housekeeper for the more afflunent citizens of Sundance and Pine Bluffs.  Derek grew up with the hateful remarks that childern can inflict upon each other.  He formed an opinion early on of the cruelty of the white man and although he didn't let it show how much it affected him on the outside.  On the inside it just made him bitter.  He had a standard upbringing, but the influence of his grandfather, Jason BlackFox, he was extremely well educated in his ancenstral history.  <BR>
<BR>
When he went on a Vision Quest in the Black Hills to find his spirit guide, he was happened upon by a pack of weres, where one Evan Walker was running with them.  Though, Derek thought he was being communicated to by the Spirit of the Wolf.. it was actually Evan, who was testing out the Lakota's heart.  Evan sensed the oneness that Derek felt with Nature, and though he was jaded in his opinion about the white man, there was a strong sense of justice.<BR>
It was this sense of honor and justice that Evan found appealing and brought him into the pack.<BR>
<BR>
As he learned more about the ways of the wolf.. both natural and unnatural, he found himself being drawn to the wolf side of his personality.   He tended to become more and more of a loner, and eventually drifted from the pack to start out on his own.  He kept in contact with Evan, but needing to travel, he kept moving south, his need for justice allowing him to eventually train and join the Texas Rangers.  He found his nitch in the world of the whte man.<BR>
<BR>
Needing a vacation from his job, Derek, having still been in contact with Evan, makes his way to Voletta.. to visit or to stay... who can say.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
