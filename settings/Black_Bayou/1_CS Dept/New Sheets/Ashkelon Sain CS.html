<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

He wears the color black almost uniformly--mostly silk and leather--with the very rare touch of either scarlet or white (scarves, etc.).  His hair falls to just past his shoulders, mostly straight, though the ends tend to curl around his neck; it tangles easily in the wind, giving him a deliciously rumpled look.  Shoes are usually Doc Martins; he wears no visible jewelry save for a single silver stud in his right earlobe.  His nails are painted black, and he smokes clove cigarettes and vanilla bidis.  He could be considered to look goth, except that he seems to project an aura of being above that.  His skin is pale, and he has no scars or tattoos as distinguishing marks.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	In these jaded times, Ashkelon Sain could be considered a throwback to the days of the Renaissance Man, centuries ago.  A dabbler, his formal education is not quite complete, and stretches over numerous different fields--medicine, botany, law, literature, art, cooking, psychology.  But his interests lay specifically in two fields; medicine--surgery, to be precise--and criminal justice.<BR>
	Not at all unusual, since Ash is a serial killer.<BR>
	Ashkelon Sain was born to a wealthy family in Seattle--stomping grounds to the likes of Ted Bundy, the Green River Killer, and Kenneth Bianchi (of the Hillside Strangler duo) for a time--and lived there throughout his childhood.  A charming, intelligent child, Ash was good at impressing his peers and adults with his sharp mind, quick wit, and good looks; however, once the original, surface impression had faded, it became obvious that deeper down, he was quiet and somewhat insecure, though masking it well.  He had no close friends, and no long-term romantic relationships in his teens and early twenties.  His parents were worried about a number of problems that had manifested themselves as far back as his toddler years, including bed-wetting and setting small fires; hidden from them by Ash was also catching, torturing, mutilating, and killing small animals from the age of six.<BR>
	His first killing took place while he was still in high school.  Cruising the strip one night in the car his father had given him for his 16th birthday, a black 1960 Corvette, he picked up a girl on a street corner for some cheap sex, thinking her a prostitute.  She turned out to be a runaway instead, and after having sex in an abandoned and condemned house in one of the poorer neighborhoods in Seattle, the same urges he had felt when torturing the animals overtook him.  He strangled her, then cut up the body and dumped the pieces down an old well in the house's basement.  The body wasn't discovered for over three years, by which time he had gone on to more of the same.<BR>
	Ashkelon has attended various colleges, earning most of a medical degree; he lacks just 6 credits to be ready to practice.  Most of his knowledge is put to use for his true passion, murder; he has become quite proficient at seducing women, drugging them with his large collection of stolen drugs, then carving them apart like a master surgeon.  His interests in criminology and forensic pathology have given him valuable information on how to make certain that he leaves nothing on the bodies to be traced back to him--fibers, body fluids, fingerprints, etc.--and indeed, most of the time the bodies are completely destroyed.  He carves certain portions of the muscles--the 'meat'--to eat, and the rest is ground up in meat grinders, incinerated, or fed to the gators.<BR>
	A true wanderer, Ash has moved from Seattle to San Diego, and from there to Chicago, then New Orleans--as well as many small towns in between--before finally ending up in Isle Voletta.  Like the aforementioned Ted Bundy, he is charming and intelligent, and has left a trail of bodies in his wake: 11 in Seattle, 7 in San Diego, 9 in Chicago, 6 in New Orleans--and now two already in Voletta, making him one of the more prolific killers of modern times, at a total of 35 and counting.  His preferred victims are women--though he will, of course, kill anyone unlucky enough to catch his eye.<BR>
