While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Through the use of powerful magic and ages of practicing, Lamia have the ability to magick their clothing to change with them.  When they return to their human form, they will once again be wearing clothing.  Only cloth will work with this mastery as other materials will not blend with the shape changer and fall to the ground.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  NA / Scene; takes 0 rounds to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lamia is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Lamia attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to flawlessly detect the true nature of a target.  The Lamia will instantly know what the individual's breed is.  The individual must IM the Lamia with the truth if the Lamia wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the demon.

	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Born April 1, 1898, Chikara Winterhawk has followed the path of Raven and Coyote--the trickster, who marked her as his own when she was born on the day of the Fool, or April Fool's Day, as the White Man calls it--all her life.  Chikara's father was the shaman for his tribe from the age of 16 until he died at age 70.  He had no son to follow in his footsteps, only a daughter--Chikara, who was 23 when he died.  Chikara was first in so many things--first member of the tribe to go to high school, much less first woman to do so--that they didn't bother to protest when she took over as the shaman for the tribe.  Things at the time were changing for women, including the right to vote, and she had learned at her father's knee all he knew--the tribe's legends, mythology, history, culture, healing ways, rites of blessing, rituals and medicine man training.  She is 102 now...and has come to Isle Voletta in search of her grand-daughter and only remaining relative, Rya Winter.<BR>
	Chikara is patient and pragmatic, willing to go to insane lengths to learn new things--as evidenced by her attending a white school in the first place, an unheard-of thing for an Indian woman in the 1910's.  Her upbringing was sufficiently harsh that she does indeed carry grudges and/or a prejudice against whites in general, but she is also open-minded enough not to let it interfere with her getting new information when she seeks it, or any goal she might pursue.  She is honest to a fault, blunt (but can be tactful when the occasion calls for it), quiet around strangers, curious about everything going on in the world around her, and intensely devoted to the few friends she has.  She is slow to trust, especially outsiders, but once trust is given, it lasts forever unless one does something to shatter it.  Finally, knowing all her tribe's legends about Indian demons and monsters, she is curious about finding out about corresponding myths the whites have...and so studies the white tales of the 'devil' and his ilk--vampires, werewolves, etc...whenever a chance arises.<BR>
	Chikara can speak to the spirits, and they speak back to her, having granted her many of the gifts of the ancient wonder-workers of the Native American people--the ability to change her shape, the ability to see in the dark like an animal, the ability to heal her wounds as if they were smoke, and speak in the minds of others.  At the age of 102, Chikara Winterhawk is -ancient-...but that makes her no less formidable an opponent, for she has had decades in which to gather the information to use against any foes that might harm her or the ones she loves.<BR>
