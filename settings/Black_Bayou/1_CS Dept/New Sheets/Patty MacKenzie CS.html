System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Every once and awhile, someone comes along who is so exceptionally gifted at something that their ability far exceeds anyone else's.  This mastery allows the player to temporarily add +3 to the skill that was selected for their Gift.  The player must roll 2d6 + the stat of the skill being increased.  The target number for the roll is 16.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill makes the character a Phenom.  This skill may only be used once per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Leggy, well groomed, dazzling... at 5'10 with a voluptuous figure, her Dior, Chanel, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton suits and dresses are selected to set off her golden blonde hair, (which under certain lighting has the merest hint of red), her fair complexion and sea-mist green eyes.  Deep in the summer, a hint of freckles might be found on her cherubic features.<BR>

Born on New Year's Day, 1970 to Charles and Delores MacKenzie, of the New Hampshire MacKenzies, she was the middle of 5 children.  Her other siblings, all brothers (Charles Jr., Phillip, Henry and Louis in order by age) were raised to go into various political/banking careers.  Boys were essential to Charles MacKenzie continuing the family dynasty of banking and politics in the New England arena.  Girls were decorative and useful only if good marriages could be made for them.  Patricia was shuttled off to boarding school early on and later to the better colleges, Radcliffe, Vassar and eventually graduated with a law degree from Harvard.  After graduation, she shunned her parents attempts at matchmaking her with the elitists and preferred the company of taxi drivers and bartenders... basically for the stories they could tell her... they had intrinsic entertainment value.<BR>
<BR>
Upon graduation from law school, she came into her inheritance as set up by her grandmother and decided to set up a practice in a small town so that she could actually learn her trade by doing.  If she screwed up, it would be by her own mistakes, and not those of large firms that wanted to work her 20 hours a day while they took 90% of the money she earned for them.<BR>
<BR>
She moved to Belize, Maine where she made countless mistakes but learned a great deal about a lot of things... lawyering being one of them.  It was in Belize that she discovered a woman that showed her how to earn millions of dollars tax free annually.  She represented the woman in a number of lawsuits, winning a few, losing a few, and learning a lot.<BR>
<BR>
After a while of this, she decided to try the woman's trade... and discovered she was quite good at it.  And wouldn't Daddy just be surprised to find out just how good his little girl could be when she really applied herself.  Deciding that the winters of New England were just too much for a person of her new stock and trade, she moved to a sleepy little town in the bayou area of Louisiana where she could set up a network similar to what her friend in Belize, Maine ran... and with Patricia's drive, she would only settle for being the best.  And when you're an expensive call girl, it's a definite plus to be the best.<BR>
