 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I>Background: </B></I>Matt remembers nothing of his past. His family had all been killed in an automobile accident when he was 20. In the same accident that resulted in his family's death he lost all memory. His parent's body and the car and vanished by the time he woke from the injury. His head was hit and bleeding pretty badly. All Matt was able to remember prior to the accident was only his age and his name. He recalls nothing from the events before the accident other than those two things. For 5 years Matt has been searching for any shred of his past that he could find and has gotten very little of what he seeks. He's held down countless jobs, many of which contained hairnets and nametags. He did live with a guy name John Kyle who was a retired Bartender. Sense Kyle had dubbed Matt as "Bartender Material" and claimed that the field might help provide him with ways to get the answers he seeks, Kyle taught Matt the "ropes" of bartening. When Matt had woken from his injury 5 years ago he had found a small metal box. Until recently it had been rusted shut until one week ago when Matt finally got it opened. Inside was a crumpled piece of paper. The paper read "Isle Voletta, Louisiana" Matt hopes to find something about his past there. At least a tiny shred that could lead him to find out just what happened to his family after the accident, had there been "foul play" to cause the accident, information about his family and himself, and other such things. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>  <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER> <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Background Update 12-9-99: Many things have happened to Matt in the past month to make him into what he is now. First, he has had many flashbacks from his past as saw the deaths of his parents and siblings. They were killed by Vampires. Matt immediately recognized them and has held a grudge sense. This grudge against this race has lead to the establishment of URMOVH (Underground Resistance Movement Of Vampire Hunters). URMOVH has suitable staff of secretaries and hunters and should be a great movement. Also, Matt's cousins Chad and Clay are now in Voletta. Chad is a Current FBI Agent and Clay is an Ex-bartender. Matt also remembers that his last name was changed to Holder and was first Bishop. His name was changed to protect his family from Vampires. Matt's dad was a Vampire hunter. His grandfather was a Vampire hunter. His great-grandfather was a Vampire hunter, and the legacy goes further back. Matthew was given the middle name of Bishop when his name was changed, but his last name was changed to Bishop. During the month, he has grown in love with his roommate, Safyre Kelly. The two have had an edgy relationship from the beginning, but things are beginning to smooth out...almost.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> <BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Update 2-20-99: Now a Vampire, Matthew attempts to find good left in the world by helping others whenever possible. He greatly resembles the "big brother" type of character now, taking on the role of friend, companion, and all around decent guy, even in this dark town. His lone mission in life is to help others and stop evil Vampires from ripping the world to shreds. As his Vampire powers grow, his heart does as well. A majority of his memory has returned to him, the past of his Vampire hunting family known to him all too well. His blood runs thick with the blood of brave, powerful men, though the darkness is always out to get him, especially the European Vampires. The last name of Bishop has proved to be a gift as well as a curse. Lord only knows what fate awaits a man with that name. The darkness is constantly on his back in hopes of consuming his very soul to get revenge for the death of the many slewn Vamps. Only time will tell Matthew's fate.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> <BR>
