 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
 <B><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Jean is American, but was born in France on September 16, 1971 At 11:11 am.<BR>
 His mother, died while birthing him, was raised by his father Marcus. His Family moved to France on business 6 years prior to his birth, his father being caught up in the rising computer era for business. He was a programmer, rare in his profession, he was stationed in Paris.<BR>
 <BR>
 It was 11:16 am when his mother was pronounced dead, his father destroyed, and overjoyed, and Jean opening his lungs for only the 60th time. Over months Marcus grew more able to cope with his loss, with the aid of course of Jean. He had no time to cry with a new baby.<BR>
 <BR>
 At about 7 Jean started to get into computers. At 10, he wrote his first program, a virus. He father giggled at the weak virus that would display "poop face" on the screen and eventually delete a database or two before it override itself in the process.<BR>
 <BR>
 Marcus thought the boy should start training for manhood now. So he made Jean do 10 pushups a day, and 20 sit-ups. This went on for a year. On his 11th birthday, Jean received a BB gun, and some primitive programming books.<BR>
 <BR>
 Jean would either be doing homework, shooting birds, or playing on his fathers computer. This grew, Jean received his first riffle at 13 a .22. His dad taught his the value safety around guns, "Treat it as a precious computer Jean, and don't let anyone touch it". Jean did as his father wished. Now moving on to small rodents in the woods and birds. (of course)<BR>
 <BR>
 At 15 Jean received his first PC. Ahh the day has come, victory. It was an apple. Day and night. He was on his precious little prize, clinging to it like a baby to a nipple. Jean was writing programs now, to test himself. Some good, to enhance his computer game pleasures, compression, and all around use. Some bad, to crash systems, hard drives. <BR>
 <BR>
 At 17, Jean went to America, fluent in French and American he was ready for the battle of college. He majored in computer electronics, and a minor in law. He started to becoming in interested into this new thing. The Internet. Ahh his gateway!<BR>
 <BR>
 Uploading! Downloading! Information! Power! Money! All at his finger tips, a computer prodigy, he was good at what he did.<BR>
 <BR>
 23 Now, he went back to visit his father for two months before he headed to Tokyo and their vast technological society to learn more.<BR>
 <BR>
 He went, there at his third week in his apartment, working for a computer company part time and going to night school, he was robbed. He didn't have any of his weapons with him "Damn!" he left that in France so he wouldn't have to deal with customs. He was beaten to an inch of his life.<BR>
 <BR>
 After three weeks in the hospital, his dad hovered above him, as he slipped out of his coma. "He's awake!"<BR>
 <BR>
 His dad was almost crying thinking he had lost his son along with his love. After about an hour of off and on conversation, trying not to push Jean too hard Marcus introduced the man next to him. A short oriental man.<BR>
 <BR>
 This is Cho Sin, and old friend, we were room mates in college. The short man bowed. <BR>
 <BR>
 After six months of non stop working, going to school, and being with Cho on the weekends Jean was exhausted. He had gotten his second degree technical application of computer hardware. Now there was this man, who was teaching him how to fight. This Cho character appearing out of no where. He was tough, he kicked Jean's butt every spar. Jean got better though. Learned to know what to expect.<BR>
 <BR>
 After five years in Asia, and constant night classes, and one too many martial arts classes Jean came back to the America he knew and felt best in, after a brief stop to say hi to dad. Jean went to DC, got a temporary job with a respectable software company. He then logged on his computer, with a sardonic grin on his face. To be taken away......<BR>
 <BR>
 He wanted to move to a no where place, ah what's this? Voletta, an island. Oooh, apartments for sale. Yes, here we go.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
