They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 Background: Conviction was born as a good, healthy baby. With very religious parents and family members. He attended regular school, turning out as a higher than average student. Though never wanted to take any real action. He enjoy the more barbaric qualities of life. Mostly sports. But he read up on major wars and battles withen the battle or faith related. This affected him psychologicly. Believing a fist was the way to convert, to teach the ways of god. Though his parents denied of his violent and almost psychotic behavior as a teenager, and never took any action. He graduated with high honors and his GED in highschool and took away immediatly toward college. If not by choice, by force of his parents. When he was done, he returned home with his bachelors degree. His consiousness was growing more active and violent.. he eventually killed his father. Which, as he thought, was a message from God to pursue this action. He fled from his sin, toward the Isle of Sleepiness. Isle Volleta. "His destiny lies in this island", he dreamed. He is still searched of the murder, though he keeps low. During his stay at Volleta, he had strange occurancences with the "supernatural". One incident for example, he was on his way home at night when he heard of a old man in need. He thought he saw the old man despertly run his way into the woods, following him a large "bear". He didn't mind about this at first. But he got into closer situations, until he himself was close to death by one of these wolf/bears. He did not fully understand these creatures that he had the incredible luck of commonly seeing.  He had a dream, to slay these creatures who stalk the innocent. To "lay them in blood on their own soil". He followed this dream, as by command of God himself. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
