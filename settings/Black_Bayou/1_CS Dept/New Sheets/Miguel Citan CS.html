 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
 <B><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 Appearance (clothes, etc.):</B> A dancer's build is swathed in dark clothes of various colours. Boots cover his legs up to mid-calf, hiding a small knife in a boot sheath on the right side. Sleeves are full length and close fitting as are the jeans portion of his outfit. The blue-touched black of his thick hair falls in waves to a few inches below his shoulders, pulled back into a tail, at times, for convenience. Eyes of blackfire peer out from beneath thick lashes on the flawed world with a kind of hope. The pale skin of his Northern European grandmother shows in the revealed hands and face. The hands move in animated gestures displaying musician's length and grace. The face is composed of strong, high formed lines, oval eyeset, and a distinctly Roman nose over a lush mouth. Below this delicately strong face, rests a locket most often resting even beneath his shirt. A black and silver Harley hauls him and his acoustic guitar everywhere.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Let's begin this with love. After all, that is where he would start. During Spain's civil war, preceding WW II, both sets of his Spanish Gypsy grandparents fled to America, managing, for the sake of friendship, to stick together and settle on the Texas Coast. It was luck that managed to get a good portion of their families there also. His parents, though born here, spoke better Spanish than English, and even Miguel's speech carries a Castilian flavor. Family life for Miguel, or Miko his nickname, was loving and despite the sometimes harsh bigotry of the border states towards 'Mexicans', Miko's education was thorough - up until high school. Now is where we fast forward until that high school venture.<BR>
 <BR>
 It was until his senior year before he actually understood what his parents meant when they said they only had to look in the other's eyes. It was not until the end of that year that he understood his maternal grandmother's advice that young love often does not survive. Of course, her prediction this time had not a betrayel at its end. It had death. But that is too fast, eh?<BR>
 <BR>
 He met Amanda in his physics class - and had to wonder how he missed her over the three prior years of high school. It was almost his birthday, months after they had privately agreed to marry, when she told him, smiling nervously, that she was pregnant. She was just two months gone - not even showing yet when the lovely graduation pictures were taken. Miko had been welcomed to one of her clique's graduation party where the alcohol flowed freely. The tale can be guessed from here, no? Miko got into a fight with a jealous jock, breaking a vase over his head and was cooling his heels in the back of a police cruiser while the jock's parents swore at their son - apparently holding more respect for humanity than their child. And Amanda's parents had come to escort her home, thinking time away from both boys would do her good. The small Nissan was unrecognizable after the drunken driver of the suburban missed a red light.<BR>
 <BR>
 The next five years were a haze to him really. It was blur of playing his guitar in one place or another, for one struggling band or another. It was scraping the bottom of sanity, struggling with the God his parents taught him over her death. It is within the last year that in his travels he has found the terms and peace he sought. The sound of her voice that had haunted him throughout, began promising him a way to feel her touch again - a way to understand, at least partially why she had died. This is where his travels on his paternal grandparents' graduation gift leave him at Isle Voletta's edge, seeking that higher understanding.<BR>
