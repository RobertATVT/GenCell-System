 They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a non-believer.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  	Born on August sixteen he was the first of three children, and Marcus Hill devoted his life to making the all-mighty dollar. He had a plan in place, and was ready to execute it. He was going to play football, he was good at it after all. He played his way through high school, and into LSU. He gained the reputation of a tough, gritty back with speed and control. He was also damaged goods.<BR>
  <BR>
  	By the age of sixteen, Marcus had fallen to the world of violence and drugs that inhabit the projects. He made it abundantly clear that he enjoyed that world, and that hurt his chances of going to college. He drifted from interview to interview, school to school, not really caring what happened.<BR>
  <BR>
  	He ended up at LSU, and played his heart out to prove his doubters wrong. He lasted three years, and then, in what he thought would be his last game, disaster struck. He was running up the sideline with roughly five minutes remaining on the clock in an LSU rout. He planted his foot, just as a safety came in with a bone-crushing tackle. His football career was over.<BR>
  <BR>
  	Forced to walk, or rather limp, around the campus, he quickly sank into depression. He wandered the streets at night like a spector, and one night came upon a rather interesting display. It was a vampire, hard at work on a girl's throat.<BR>
  <BR>
  	He watched with a sense of morbid fascination as the vampire sucked the body dry. Instantly he felt a burning urge awake inside of him. He had to learn about them, not to kill them, but because they interested him. He was obsessed, and with his obsession came a new purpose. He immediately began to check out odd books at the library so he could learn all there was to know about vampires. Armed with his knowledge, he left Baton Rouge, and made his way to Voletta.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
