 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

From her father she stole the kelly green eyes. <BR>
       Shes usually seen in a pair of jeans and a shirt that reveals the spider web tattoo covering a crescent moon that wraps around her pierced navel.  She also has a tattoo of a snake on her left shoulder,curled around a water jug, and a black rose with a spider web and a hanging black wido on her hip.  Her accent is the compilation of her fathers irish tongue, her mothers jamaican,and growing up in varous places along the east coast of the united states.<BR>

          What would happen, if you took a man bred and born in Ireland, in an environment strictly enforced with the laws rules and regulations of the catholic church and sent him to New Orleans one year so he could fully experience Mardi Gras??<BR>
         And then........<BR>
           You take a woman of African American descent, born and bred on the island of Jamiaca, under the traditions of Voodun, from a line extending far longer then the length of an arm in Voodoo priestesses,and sent her to visit her grandmother during this wonderful season of Mardi Gras. <BR>
     And then allowed them to meet?<BR>
        In this particular instance it turned out to be a wild  week long copulation event,due to the lack of will power on both parts. So against everyones wishes they decide to get married, she moves with him to Ireland..and diligently begins trying to hide the fact that the seed really was planted a bit earlier than the wedding date..but who was counting (<starts rambling> besides his parents,her parents, the doctor,the priest, the priestess...eh what the heck eh? <g> ). But of course the fatal mistake had to be made..and they decided to discuss their religions.<BR>
        Your end result is a confused child who elieves whole heartedly,that you use a cross to make a chicken sacrifice its life to the loa.And then in ritual you allow the holy water to rise to the sky to drown the angels of the ancestors.<BR>
        However in this case we will call her Tikara.<BR>
     At age five frequent comments were made to her constantly bickering parets how adorable the child was. By the time she was eight they began whispering prayers as she passed, and by ten..all hope was lost. At 16 her parents knew that unless some spectacular miracle was to occur, they might as well give up the dreams of ever hearing their names and grandparents in the same sentence. <BR>
       From the first time she watched the Karate Kid, Tikara became entranced with the Japanese fightin styles, Tai Chi Chuan being her favorite, she quickly became an expert at it.<BR>
      In high school she became fan of wrestling,using her older brother as a practice target,since the school she attended spoke very clearly that they didnt have any room for fem,ale wrestlers, she decided to demote herself to cheerleading. This allowing her to attend every game and many practices..... Also earning several awards in Volleyball,Basketball soccer and Track and field.<BR>
       At 18 she joined the Army, using her years in the military to gain strength speed and agility, luckily she already had the speed. It also served as a place to expand her relationships with others. She aced every physical fitness test at male standards,went to Airborne school, Air assault courses and in general kept her drill sargeants in bootcamp and the rest of chain of command in awe. After four years she left,learning all she felt she needed to and pretty much becoming bored.<BR>
        After a three year sabbatical shes now in Voletta. Her grandmother (mothers side) leaving her a house and a fortune to pretty much do as she wished with upon her death.<BR>
       She revels in anything that involves pain,whether giving or recieving, though giving generally results in a brighter smile falling from her lips. She's gone as far as to turn one of the rooms in her grandmothers house to accompany all of her fetishes, zeroing in on the more....demented ones.<BR>
        Several cabinets in the room also sport a lare knife collection, all under lock and key, ranging from the smallest of pocket knives to various sized swords. These remain put up at all times...except for those special times when one or more will venture with her to the bedroom, on especially lonesome nights <eg></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> <BR>
