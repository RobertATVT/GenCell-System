<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

5'7", average weight, with short-cropped golden-brown hair, tan complexion, and strong muscles.  She has a slightly mousy appearance, pointed nose, slanted eyes, and a pretty smile.  Kay is slightly near-sighted and wears perscription glasses or contact lenses.  She's definately of no particular ethnic group, but looks like a very thick mixture.  Clothing-wise she dresses rather casually when not working, limiting herself to jeans, blouses and sneakrs.  If she's working directly with the animals, she sticks to the basics, a tightly-woven long-sleaved, ankle-length jumpsuit and gloves, with goggles to protect her eyes.  She leaves off the glasses and wears contact lenses instead.  Doing accounting work she dresses in dress-suits, pants-suits, and casual outfits, and will usually wear her glasses.<BR>

      Kay Landers is the middle child in a large, close-knit family that owns and opperates its own animal training company in Isle Voletta.  She, like her parents and her sibs, has a licence in animal training, as well as a 2-year degree in accounting.  Because the business is family owned and opperated, she handled the financial matters for the group.  Her specialization is working with canines, particularly wolves and wolf-hounds.  She has also handled bears, tigers, and horses, though she's not as good at handling them as she is wolves.<BR>
       Moriah is an angel who brushed with evil at the beginning and the war in Heaven.  Although she had fought on the side of the light, when the fallen angels were banished from Heaven she chose to go with them, feeling that the punishment was too harsh and that they were treated unjustly.  For some centuries she lived her life as a demon.  However, she grew sick of the Darkness, and begged forgiveness and to be allowed to return to ranks of her brethren in Heaven.  It was granted, but since she was "tainted" (at least in her own eyes), Moriah requested not to work with mortal humans, but rather with animals, working as their overseer and protector until she had completed her penetance and could be trusted around humans again.  She answers directly to St. Francis of Asisi.  Her assignments were large carniverous animals, particularly wolves.<BR>
       One day while in the middle of shooting a clip for a TV comercial, Kay was working with some of the wolf-hounds her family ownes when an electrical malfunction set the stage she and her animals were on on fire.  Kay and her family managed to get out, along with all but two of the hounds.  When the fire was under control and extinguished, Kay went back inside to find one of the animals alive but dying.  She prayed for assistance.  Enter Moriah.<BR>
       Moriah, meanwhile, had been reassigned.  She was to begin work, not directly with humans yet, for she had not totally complteted her required penatance, but rather with the group known as lycanthropes.  Werewolves.  She was in the vicinity of Isle Voletta when she felt Kay's prayer and went to assist.  Kay, being rather devout, was the perfect subject for hostdom for Moriah, and she was in total agreement to it so long as her pets were cared for.  Thus, Moriah joined with Kay Landers and healed the wolf-hound with Gift of Life.  <BR>
       Kay still works as an animal trainer and accountant for her family's practice.  However, as Moriah Kay, she's also become devoted to the dual task of caring for both Werewolves and their potential victims.  First, she's something of a "guardian angel" to weres, and second, it's her responsibility to tend to the victims of were attacks and prevent the attacks from occurring.  She's still somewhat timid around other humans, but is an excellent angel.<BR>

 Angel > Mortal was approved on 3/6. IC she fell somewhat before that, but you know how that goes.<BR>

 As far as the RP went, Sebastian bit her on 3/7. The full moon is officially on 3/20.<BR>

 Lycaon said it shouldn't matter, Cloud said check, and Savant is the one that said no. So, I'm asking. <grumbles></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Bookman Old Style" LANG="0"> >><BR>
You came to the right person, as this is most definitely a 'vague rule' sort of question.<BR>

Okay - Approved CS for more than 30 days, check. May not change breeds more than once per update... no check. Since you cannot update more than once in a 30 day period (a strange rule perhaps, but a rule nonetheless),  you're just going to have your friend not submit an update. What can they submit, you ask?<BR>
