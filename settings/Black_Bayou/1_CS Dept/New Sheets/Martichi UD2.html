  System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift<BR>
  Effect/Description:  This spell enables the lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
  animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">ANTEmail 2</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 hour to cast<BR>
  Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a full hour to cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will for the lamia to start over a gain.  The lamia must role-play the hour long casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

  System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast<BR>
  Effect/Description:  The lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the lamia to flawlessly detect the true nature of a target.  The lamia will instantly know what the individual's breed is.  The individual must IM the lamia with the truth if the lamia wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the demon.  Lamia must possess Lore Level 2 for the breed they are attempting to detect, in order to recognize it for what it is.  If the lore is not possessed, the lamia will only know there is something odd about the target.<BR>

   <B>System/Duration:</B>  2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B> This is the truest measure of a lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The lamia can solidify at will, although once they do, they must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in this form, the lamia is immune to physical attacks of all kinds and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they can not be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>What breeds independent humans also breeds corruption.  At times, the Mentor may need to reprimand one of their students.  The worst punishment that could befall a lamia is the loss of their spell casting abilities.  This mastery goes a step further.  When the coven joins together, they encircle the victim.  The coven recites an ancient phrase repeatedly throughout the casting.  The Mentor then identifies the victim and calls their crimes out over the chanting of the coven.  The ritual is complete after a period of 5 minutes when the victim is completely stripped of all magical ability for the next 24 hours.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> One of the Lamia's greatest abilities is the power over gravity itself, allowing the Lamia the gift of flight.  There are two separate spells intertwined in this singular one.  <BR>
<BR>
   Solo flight:  This costs 1 Soul and allows the Lamia to fly unaided.  The Lamia can never fly faster than 25 miles an hour and cannot carry anything over ten pounds. <BR>
<BR>
   Enchanted Flight: This costs 2 Soul and allows the Lamia to transfer the power of flight into an inanimate object - some of the most common being brooms and carpets.  The Lamia cannot empower any object weighing more than ten pounds.  The empowered object will fly where the Lamia wishes, though the Lamia doesn't have to be in direct contact with the object, they must remain concentrating on it.  Conversation is possible, but not even walking will be allowed.  This empowered object is capable of carrying passengers, depending on the size of the object - as passenger weight doesn't effect the magic, space does.  Common sense prevails here, but if you aren't sure ask the Room Host or ST on how many passengers can fit.  The object also doesn't need to be in sight, as the Lamia can 'see' from the object itself.  If the Lamia loses concentration the object will lose the gift of flight and will gently fall to the ground, much like a feather.  This has been built into the spell due to past Lamia's dying horrible deaths as their objects crashed to the earth.  The object will retain some aspects of magic if dropped into water (it will float) or even fire (has protection as long as the passengers don't leave the object) as there is a small 'bubble' of protection around the passengers.  However, passengers can still be effected by blows, shot, stabbed and even hit with arrows.  In both versions of the mastery, the protective sphere prohibits items from exiting the bubble (These include but are not limited to physical objects and the effects of masteries)  Think - things can go in, but things can't go out.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 30 / 6 rounds or 3 minutes; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  On our Earth there are many dimensions of spirits that are just outside our realm of existence. The Lamia are one of the few who can actually harness the cosmic power of these spirits. Just as in life there are two major spheres of spirits.  Those who are for the light, and those who serve on the dark side.  By practicing their arts for lost ages, Lamia have learned the ability to call upon the powers of either the light or the dark.  Before the Lamia casts this mastery, they will notify the ST of which they are trying to invoke.  If the Lamia invokes a spirit from the light realm, they will receive +2 to their Will, +2 to their Inits, +2 to their Dodge and -4 to their Attack for the duration of the spell as the good spirit empowers the caster.  If the Lamia invokes a spirit from the dark realm, they will receive a +2 to their Attack, +2 to Inits, +2 to Dodge and a -4 to their will for the duration of the spell.  However, if the Lamia does not successfully call the spirit, the failed attempt will leave them stunned for two rounds.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>The Lamia has learned to seek others out by manipulating their spell: Mindspeak.  This allows the Lamia to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the Lamia is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the Lamia must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>
