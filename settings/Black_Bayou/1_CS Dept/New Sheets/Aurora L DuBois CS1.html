 </B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

 <B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)<B><I><U><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the werewolf possesses a natural animal quickness, which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the werewolf, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B>By baring it's massive razor sharp teeth and issuing forth a frightening roar, the werewolf can paralyze its victim with fear.  If successful, the victim will be at -4 to Attack and Quickness for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>       <I>Aurora is 18 years old, and looks like a 13 year old boy, almost.  She is 4'8", 75 pounds, has long brown hair, to her waist that she braids and pulls beneath her baseball cap.  Her eyes are hazel, and have amazingly long lashes, she has a tiny line of freckles that march across a pug nose that seems to fit her tiny features.  She usually wears oversized jeans, a chain connecting her pocket watch to them, and layers design sweatshirts and t-shirts.  She wears no jewelry but a small pendent with the Hebrew symbol for "Alive" around her neck.  She is Isreali, Jewish by birth and proud of her heritage.  She shows no inhibitions, and her parents always warned her that someday her lack of tact would get her in major trouble.  She plays the 'cello very profiently and has just recieved her degree from the Julliard School of Music.  Also, due to a strange happening, she died in a car accident, but remained.

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>       <I>Aurora grew up in Jerusalem.  There at the age of six she had already had two performances broadcasted on Israeli Radio.. She was accepted to the Julliard School of Music at the age of eight and studied in their pre-college program until she had passed all that needed to be done in order to recieve her degree.  Now at the age of 18, she has heard of a Doc. Sinclair that has been directing the orchestra in Ilse Voletta and curious, she has made her way their, with her Stradivarius Cello at her side.</I><BR>
       <BR>
       As of May, 1998, the angel that inhabited the form of Aurora left her, fled the body that was quickly crumbling beneath the responsibility of her position.  She has been restored her mortal form as a punisment from The Light.  Cursed now to walk the earth she blessed before, unable to aid those she turned her back on.<BR>

       In June, 1998, Aurora was bit by BBCH Bear, and made the change to Werewolf, June 10th, 1998<BR>

 </B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

 <B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
