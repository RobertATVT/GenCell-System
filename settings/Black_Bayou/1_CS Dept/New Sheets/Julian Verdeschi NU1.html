<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

Physical Description:<BR>
     Julian Verdeschi is a man surround by a cloak of mystery of death.  A man who prefers his privacy, the intense hazel eyes seem to pierce a person's soul.  Those same eyes, however, also carry the tortures of his soul as well.  The sliken mane frames the classic features and fall to just below the broad shoulders.  The olive- complexion is enhanced by the smober hues of his clothing.  The athletic-built man carries himself with a confidence and as a man who had Death as a constant companion.  He rarely engages in conversation and will answer to questions about his past.  He refrains from drugs of any kind, including alcohol and nicotine.  His eyes are always watching and his back is always facing the wall.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Julian Anthony Verdeschi was born in Caltanissetta, Sicily, to Anthony and Sophia Verdeschi.  The middle child with an older brother, Anthony, Jr. and a younger sister, Ceciley.  They lived the life of the privilaged as the family was well-known for their red wines.  Julian, however, found something missing in his life and searched for something to fill it.  He was a wild child, and as he moved into his teen years, he began to drift away from the family.  To curb his wild ways, his father enrolled him into a military academy in Italy.<BR>
<BR>
Julian chaffed under the enforced military discipline, but did learn how to focus and keep his concentration admidst any type of distraction.  He found himself a natural with firearms and quickly became a master marksman.  The academy, however, was owned by an international underground organization known only as the Shadow World Organization.  This organization searches the world wide for possible future members.  Julian came to their attention, and his course of study was slowly changed.  They slowly desensitized him to the tradegy of mankind.  He became less and less concerned with human rights and that targets were just that, targets.<BR>
<BR>
The Shadow World Organziation maintained several branches, one being Homicide International Trust into which Julian was inductued into.  He quickly rose through the ranks, attaining Rank 1.  No contract was ever left unfullfilled, and even within TSWO, some were starting to fear him.  It was this fear that caused a plan to be put into action.  A plan that was to discredit Julian, but carried a more longer- lasting aftermath for the man.  A new contract was written up.<BR>
     Julian found himself being sent to the Middle East.  His target was a shiek that was the power behind OPEC.  All his intel reports would be waiting his arrival.  A man who was a master of four languages: English, Italian, Russian, and Arabic, this was another routine assassination, or so Julian thought.  Once he had landed and through a careful contact, he began to study the habits of his target.  Two weeks went by, until the time was right.  Careful aim was taken and at just the right moment, the trigger was gently squeezed.  That bullet changed Julian Verdeschi for good.<BR>
The bullet passed cleanly through the target's body, to become lodged in the skull of a young girl of seven years of age.  Julian's concentration was so intense, that he never saw the child come up to his target.  Both were killed instantly and Julain felt his entire being to start crumbling.  It was at that moment that he laid down his rifle.  Not wanting to loose him, or even to liquidate him, TSWO moved him into training recruits.  His nights were tormented by the death of that child, that sleep became an unknown act to him.<BR>
     While reviewing some documents, Julian stumbled upon a commique that related to that fateful hit.  As he dug deeper, and uncovered his set up.  Not only had he killed an innocent child, but also an innocent target.  He found those responsible and dispersed his own brand of dark justice.  One slipped his wrath, and he traced the man to Isle Voletta, Louisana.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
