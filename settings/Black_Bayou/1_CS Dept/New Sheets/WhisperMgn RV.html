  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  Effect/Description:   </B>Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).<BR>

  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Background: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>Whisper led a relatively normal life, even for the daughter of the wealthy stock broker, Richard Morgan III.  Growing up in the posh Times Square district of New York City, she spent the first half of her life suckling the proverbial silver spoon.  Her mother, Danielle Morgan, worked in Richard's brokerage as well; therefore, Whisper was well provided for.  She wore the most fashionable clothing and attended the best schools.  She was fairly popular and a model student.  Surprisingly, she kept her feet planted firmly on the ground and refused to play the part of the spoiled little rich girl--at least in personality.  During her sophomore year in high school, she became infatuated with a classmate with whom she eventually fell hopelessly in love.  Then, everything fell apart.  Richard's brokerage went under due to a poor business decision on his part.  Luckily, he had enough money stashed away to pay off his debts, and he owned their home, but he was a ruined man.  Danielle was among the unemployed after the fiasco, but she soon found a job working both at home and overseas in Japan.  Richard, however, was suffering from severe depression which prevented him from working.  Danielle's prolonged absences from home coupled with the anxiety of his lost business played a heavy tune on his heart until one day he just...snapped.  One night, in a drunken stupor, he stole into Whisper's room and raped her.  Just like that.  She was too embarrassed and frightened to leave home, so she crawled behind the mask instead.  Two weeks later, she discovered that she was pregnant.  Desperate, she ran to her boyfriend for help, but when she arrived, she couldn't bring herself to tell him that the child was her father's...so she lied.  Believing it was his, her boyfriend proclaimed his undying devotion to her and pledged his support for whatever decision she chose to make.  Unable to bear the thought of a life so beautiful and yet so monstrous growing inside her, Whisper chose to have an abortion.  So accompanied by her boyfriend, she stepped through the clinic doors.  In spite of this tragedy, he asked for her hand in marriage, and she accepted.  She called her mother overseas to tell her the news, and in response, Danielle decided to come home to celebrate.  Late on the evening of her arrival, Whisper forgot to be strong and broke down in her mother's arms, blurting out the entire twisted story.  Enraged, tears streaming down her cheeks, Danielle lost control.  She dashed into the bedroom where Richard's sleeping from lay curled beneath the sheets.  She pulled a loaded gun--for protection--from the drawer on her nightstand and unloaded two rounds into his head.  Whisper chased after her mother and screamed as the shots were fired, crumpling into a sobbing heap on the floor, where she remained even as the local PD dragged Danielle away in handcuffs.  In the aftermath, Danielle was locked away for life, and with Richard pushing up daisies, she left the entire estate to Whisper.  Destroyed by the life she was living, Whisper decided that her only hope of survival was to begin a new life, free of the darkness that ate at her soul.  So, she sold the house, returned the diamond, basically abandoned her mother in jail, and disappeared into the one place where she thought the past would never follow...the bayou.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
