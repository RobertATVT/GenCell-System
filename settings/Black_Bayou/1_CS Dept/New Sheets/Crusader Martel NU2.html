<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Having such an incredible bond between pack mates, werewolves have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during times of war.  The werewolf can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its pack mates, regardless of distance.  Each pack mate must have the mastery Call The Pack to be included in the Mindspeak.  The pack must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The pack member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their pack name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the pack member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Pack members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf's sense of smell is so strong and acute, that their sense of smell can sometimes compensate for their sense of sight.  Werewolves that utilize their sense of smell can effectively "see" in complete darkness.  It can distinguish between the many different scents around him and can pinpoint their exact location.  This allows the werewolf to ignore any penalties due to vision.  Strong winds or powerful smells can throw the werewolf off.  The nuances are up to the room host, ST or GM.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> 	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>James was born in 1970 (Spain), to Robert and Susan Martel.  At the early age of 4, his parents became missionaries in Brazil, taking their one and only child with them, so he may have a lifetime of learning ahead of him.  Soon after arriving in Brazil, James soon became known to the local elders, who took the young child under their wings, teaching him of the mysteries of this world.  From their<BR>
 teaching, James soon came to learn of the darker parts of the world, thanks to the teaching of the elders.  These teachings led him down the road to his future...a man ment to learn of the dark creatures, the arts of his adopted people, namely the martial art form of Capoeira, as well as the Wrestling techniques of the native people.  Through his dealings with the dark creatures, his faith was established, and his goals settled.<BR>
 At 27, he became homesick, and returned home to his family.  After spending months with his parents, his uncle asked him to search out his cousin, on Victor Martel, and make sure he was "breathing."  Given an address of his cousin, he soon left for America, in search of his blood.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
