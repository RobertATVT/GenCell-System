</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.<BR>

	Melían was a spoiled child. His every whim was quickly granted by doting parents. If he did not do well in something, it was never his fault. It was the fault of someone "lesser" person. The right schools, the right clothes, the right attitude, the right everything- this was Mel's life. His innocent face and demeanor won him the trust of most of the people who knew him. He did not seem spoiled to the core. A bit eccentric and demanding perhaps, but nothing evil. No, never evil. When the family cat died suffocating in plastic garbage bag set outside one hot summer day, it couldn't have been the scratched up Melían. The dog stopped letting people touch him as Mel grew older. The household staff never said a word about what they saw lest they lose their jobs.<BR>
	Melían showed no interest in either gender until his late teens, when an older gentlemen in a "swingers" club convinced a drunk Mel that a one night stand would be very, very enjoyable. The next morning, with a cat's smug smile and a knife, he killed the smaller, frailer man, enjoying one final kiss as the man died. Melían took to hiring hookers of either sex to get the thrill he'd had that night- cutting them to watch the blood, wanting to drink it. But the source was usually too disgusting to entertain the idea for long. If the prostitute protested, he would merely smile and ask them who would believe them.<BR>
	Early in his third year of college, he met someone he thought would be a perfect new toy. He gave her his most charming manners, luring her in like a spider with a fly. Finally came the night late in the Spring semester when he had her...oh, the blood was beautiful. Poor, stupid child was convinced she'd earned it...done wrong and he punished her. One night he hurt her too much- cut too deep. He got lucky during the trail. His parents' rich lawyer and his own sterling reputation got him off the hook. He managed to graduate without more mistakes. When he moved to Seattle...that's where his life began...or so he'd tell you. He met a vampire. The creature had watched him from the shadows as he took victims for his knife. A laugh from behind as he carved a particularly stubborn one, caused him to turn. There <I>she</I> stood...his mother, his sister, his lover.<BR>
	This dark angel took him under her wing, first ghouling him for her pleasure. Using him, feeding him the blood he desired. Punishing him occasionally by disappearing, denying him her lifeblood until he begged in addicted agony for it. Finally with a wicked smirk she drained him of his blood. She then pinned him against the wall of his apartment and slowly carefully told him what it would be like...if he drank her blood now. Live in the shadows...no longer touched by the golden sun. With his last mortal strength, his teeth clamped down on her neck, digging into tender flesh for the blood. She laughed as he died. His racking pains amused her as she said little else had in her time. Whatever twisted love Melían had felt for her, died slowly with each tinkling laugh. Finally on the fourth night when he rose with the sunset, a vampire. He was twenty-one.<BR>
	Melían's resentment of her treatment during his change lead him to study their kind. Enough to hurt <I>her</I> for her laughter. Finally, slowly he laid a plan. He found a cheap hooker, one who would not be missed. The hooker's face almost pretty it's youth, caught his sire's eye. She smiled at her only son devilishly before tearing the soft throat out. Carefully he caught her in the rope around her as she was overcome with the blood. He laughed as she struggled...as he told her what he would do. Now she would wither in the sun. He left her in the park, bound and gagged. Walked away as she hurled obscenities into his mind. The fire she made in the park got a cameo in the local paper. After that, he decided to travel on his own...get away from the taint she left on him. Which brings him to the Isle of Veils...<BR>
