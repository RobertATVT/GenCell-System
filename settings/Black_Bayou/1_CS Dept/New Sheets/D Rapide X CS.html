You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#030000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  <B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

      </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Tall and lanky, made of tanned porcelain and black thorns, street musician and seducer in all extremes of the names.  A wild shock of ebon hair, liquid velvet, falling in a tangled curtain around the handsome visage, brushing the collar in the back.  Though wiry and thin, there are muscles and formidable strength in that gangly frame, and enough feline grace to leave the impression of an angel walking on water.  But no savior, this one, with black-hole eyes, so intensely black that if one were to gaze into them, they would be gazing into the very heart of oblivion.  Strong cheekbones and well-defined nose that turns up slightly, full lips of a dusky shade that curve to form the most perfectly wicked smile; the bone structure placed together to form a Cajun prince, clad in ragged deniem and unelegant cotton.  Tousled, vaguely disheveled, almost always with a five o'clock shadow and boyishly unkept.  Long, agile fingers, calloused by years of guitar play, a few digits decked in simple silver bands.  A stud pierces the left orb, black ink in the skin and blood along the biceps, a fire dragon of Oriental origins.  <B><BR>

      </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>It was written in the stars.  Inked in the black-and-white tapestry of the heavens, in those diamond stars of flickering fire worlds beyond the ruined reality of the thing called Earth.  Think Saturn and Uranus, the cusp of Capricorn-Aquarius.  The genuis that was Poe was born on this day, the day of Dreams and Visions, of the Sun tarot, of genuis and imagination.  <BR>
      No one could really fall under the assumption that Violet cared about her little boy.  On an outward appearance, she appeared a demure and lovely little thing, breakable almost; obviously from very strong Cajun roots, her dark and sultry appearance bosted.  And that she was- her family was native to the smoky world of New Orleans and her lineage could be traced back to the times where the city were a mere child of Paris, newborn, filled with plantation and slaves, horses and carriages.  Her parents and her grandparents lived in New Orleans, her great-grandparents and all the ones before them were buried there.  But yet, ever since the tender age of sixteen (going on seventeen) she had never laid eyes on a single member of her family.<BR>
      Single parent, teenager mother.  Darcy was never told who he actual father was but he never really asked. Violet always had a string of men parading in and out of the three-room house that they barely managed to live in.  Located in one of the more poverty-stricken sections of the French Quater, yard neglected and paint peeling, windows and shutters cracked.  The stereotypical white-trash home.<BR>
      He went to school only because he had to.  His child mother never made him, merely flitted about in her own world, with her own passions, uninterested in what her son did.  His grades were decent, above average but not excellent; he didn't put his heart into the work. <BR>
      He grew, a gangly and pale teenager, skipping classes regularly as he advanced into his adolesence.  Violet was a mere shadow in his life, sometimes there when he came home to the cracked and rotting structure that could be called a house, always ready to yell and scream at him.  Many times he would stumble upon his mother with one of her countless, faceless lovers, here today, gone in moments.  But the majority of the time he arrived at the house, it would be empty, at days on end really.  The only things in the fridge were beer and the occasional lump of fruit or molding bread, for no one was home enough to actually dine there.  But in all truth, Darcy stayed away from the house and the lingering presence of the bitter Violet.  <BR>
      Still young in his teenage years, he only saw one indication of a bright future: his music.  Not exactly the next  Mozart, but there was a genuis in the making.  He could make it happen, in the notes, in the octaves, meshing sounds and thoughts together to an emotional uproar of chaotic thoughts.  A loner, though with such an amiable attitude that friendships came easy. With a group of neighborhood boys, a band was formed and Darcy got the perfect position as the guitar player.  <BR>
      Like all teenage garage bands, it soon dispersed and by then, he had become a quiet recluse, a nonexistent presence at the thing called school.<BR>
      Around the age of seventeen, one day he noticed that his mother had failed to come home.  Not an event that was even the slightest bit surprising but Darcy noted that her last appearance or hint of life was about three weeks ago and even that was a long time for Violet to be gone from the horrid home.  After a half-hearted investigation he discovered that all her personal items and every trace of her presence had been eliminated.  Figuring that she had been romanced off by another one of her drunkard boyfriends, Darcy failed to care.<BR>
      Halfway through his senior year and she still hadn't returned to the house and Darcy still didn't care.<BR>
      He stayed at the house after he graduated, with no intention of going to a college he couldn't afford.  He stayed until they came for the house and left, haunting the streets and clubs of New Orleans like a dark stranger, with only a battered tote bag of personal items and the ruined and ancient guitar case which held the lightening black Gibson Les Paul. (How he obtained the instrument.. long story. Not exactly legal though)<BR>
      Flash forward.  Street musician, with a opium smoke drawl and magick on his fingertips, hanging around the corners and playing wherever it would pay.  Twenty years of age with forever stretched forward. Enter the Parisian, French-breed and with shock blue eyes, who wielded the flute like a God his crown.  Louis Merteuil and what a team they made.  Where there had been polite indifference and genteel apathy,  there was a friendship that grew intense.  Like brothers, kindred spirits, and how they soared.  Streets of poverty left behind and the world was taken by storm.  Well, not really, but it sound better when that's said.<BR>
      One day, they stumbled upon a hap-hazard little street child, a thief, and they formed an entertaining trio.  The musicians played and the girl snuck about, stealing wallets and money.  About half a year after their union, Louis carted all of them to Paris, where they got a job for a mob king who wore ugly suits and smiled too much. Their little friend worked for him, moonlighting in thievery every now on them.  The act from the club pulled in money but it was obviously not that that the trio prospered on- the artifacts stolen and cashed by the little thief nicknamed Peach was what they depended on.<BR>
      Peach went off to America and the trio was now a duet, like the original.  The two prospered, lived, until their crime lord and club employeer discovered that he had been ripped off by them; them hiring his thief to work for them in her off hours, that was.  So Louis got the end of a bullet and Darcy set out to America to find his little thief and to save her before another one of his friends could be taken out. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
