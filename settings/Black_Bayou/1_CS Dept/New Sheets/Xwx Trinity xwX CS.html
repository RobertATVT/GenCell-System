<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Picture blonde hair; natural brown streaking through artistically, cut in such a fashion to draw the eyes of men away from their everyday business.  Blunt ends brush between her shoulderblades and are cropped in a sutble line upward to aid the framing of her face.  Her forehead is too small to allow the presence of bangs; her face demands that nothing draw attention away from it.  Trinity is not quite so beautiful as she is arresting - the sort of girl you would walk past on the street without a second thought; and then do a double-take, wondering how you missed her in the first place.  Her figure is small and wiry; muscles well-defined in the carefully tanned arms. Small implants have firmed her breasts;plastic surgery masked the few stretch marks indicating that she has gone through childbirth.She works out regularly and maintains a strict diet. Her eyes are blue; deep and fathomless.  Secrets held within have been held for years, and looks as if they'll never be broken out.  Eyebrows are unplucked, but naturally shaped to give her a look of questioning.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 Background:<BR>
	Jan. 2, 1972<BR>
		</B>"Natalie, after my mother.  Is that all right, John?" The woman on the bed was flushed; her hair soaked and clinging to her cheeks as she looked up from the squalling bundle in her arms.  Hours of hard work had taken a toll on her, and it was apparent that she was struggling to keep her eyes open.<BR>
		"And Grace.  Name her for God's grace that allowed you to remain with me," came the response, the man's voice gentle as he leaned down to press a kiss to her damp brow.<BR>
		The nurses nearby paused in their duties to watch the exchange of love between the couple.  It was obvious that this baby was born into something special.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Dec. 25, 1990<BR>
		</B>"Jonathon!  <B>Jonathon!</B> Don't you dare run away from me!"<BR>
		Her cheeks were flushed as she darted out of the living room, sneakers squealing against the wooden floors with the sudden turn she made.  Her bookbag had been abandoned near the door, and she nearly did a nose-dive, once the toe of her shoe snagged a wayward strap.<BR>
		Anger was livid in the blue eyes; and the lanky figure was hard-pressed to keep up with her brother, one of them.  There were five total.<BR>
		"Oh boy, Natty.  Are mom and dad gonna be -pissed- when they find out," he taunted her as he came to a sudden halt in the bedroom.  On the bed, Timothy looked up from where he was studying for a test they knew was tomorrow.  His look of confusion lasted only a moment before Jon dropped the bomb.<BR>
		"Natty's stripping!"<BR>
<BR>
	<B>March 8, 1994<BR>
		</B>"Are you really going to marry him, Trinity," a voice behind her asked.  Her hand paused from applying the kohl to her eyes, then began again.  The effect a dramatic look; her shrink said she was trying to hide from her parents still.<BR>
		"Why shouldn't I? I mean, he's rich and he likes me," Natalie responded with a shrug of her shoulders and dropped the pencil down into a large, red case in front of her.<BR>
		"You really think he likes you? God, Trin.. You're so naive."<BR>
		Natalie remained still untli she heard the slam of the door behind her.  Only then, did she relax and draw a deep breath in.  The morning sickness had passed, and time was running out.  The only way to get out of marrying Kyle was to abort the baby - to make him hate her.  And she couldn't do it.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Oct. 12, 1994<BR>
		</B>"Natty.. Natty, wake up," the voice urged her to return to life.  With a muffled groan she stirred, and lightly pressed her hand to her stomach, her flat stomach.  Only then did she open her eyes, to look at the face above her.  Kyle. And he was sobbing.<BR>
		"She was stillborn, Natty.. The baby was stillborn! How could you Natty.."<BR>
		She remained quiet as the nurses escorted him out.  They urged him to calm down, to take a drink of water.<BR>
		He refused, and she received word two hours later that he had been hit, head-on, by a drunk driver.  The driver walked away, but Kyle died on impact.<BR>
		Natalie left two days later and began to make plans.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>July 3, 1998<BR>
		</B>"All right, Jake.  I've got half a million stowed away in the account. I didn't spend a dime of that insurance money from Kyle.  The hospital bills from the baby and my surgeries, both the implants and the plastic have been taken care of. I've been living on practically nothing, and I want to cash in on that building Kyle bought in this little town called Isle Voletta.  You went bust.  Deal with it.  What I'm wanting from you is to buy some of your equipment."<BR>
		The voice on the other end shouted angrily, causing her to put the receiver out into the air beside her before she began again.<BR>
		"Jake, you better take the offer.  Think about it. I'll call you later."<BR>
<BR>
	<B>June 6, 1999<BR>
		</B>"Heh. Can you believe the moron kept the door unlocked?  He was practically asking for us to take the stuff."<BR>
		The guys with Tinity glanced around what had once been a prosperous club.  The shake of their heads showed their sorrow at it being shut down.  But they were being paid well to load up the old tables and stools, and get the hell out of Dodge.<BR>
		And to top it all off, their boss had great legs.<BR>
<BR>
	<B>Jan. 1, 2000<BR>
		</B>Trinity stopped and looked around her with satisfaction.  The last of the vans had left, the items aquired lay scattered about her.  Her tools were nearby, and the bed upstairs set up.<BR>
		It was time for the business to get started.  Over the past few years, she had gone back to college and aquired a business degree.  With her experience, and the new knowledge gained from school, she felt she was ready to tackle her biggest challenge of all.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

3) Summary (what you want to happen)<BR>
</I>	The entrance is simple.  Double-doors; wooden and a little worse for wear, framed by solid oak posts and a plan exterior.  Once the handles are grasped, you step into this small paradise.<BR>
	To the left, there is a polished bar.  The nicks and scratches have been painsakingly filled in and polished - in the dim light, they are barely noticable.  Besides, no one is here to study these sort of things, are they?  Barstools (hijacked from a horribly named place called 'Al's') line the enter row. Backless, with no ledges to rest your feet on.  If you want to be comfortable, it will have to be at one of the twenty or so tables scattered around the floor.<BR>
	The stage is a creation thought of, and built, by Trinity herself.  Designed for easy access by the dancers, but quelling the idea of interaction by the men sure to visit. Smooth wooden panels make up the floor of the curvy stage.  Not polished so heavily that a dancer might slip; but covered with a unique laquer that is gritty in nature.  The edge of this winding stage is trimmed with a small, spiked fence, about four inches tall.  The tips are blunted; so as not to cause serious harm, and the material it is made of glitters menacingly; a reminder that only the girls are allowed on stage.  There are three places where this fence is not placed.  The middle entrance of the stage (dead center of the room; the stage extending from there to the back wall, where there is a curtained entrance) and the two side steps.  One snug against the left wall (steps leading right into the bartenders area); the other against the right wall (steps ending next to a small hall that holds two doors - one to the office, the other to a same sex bathroom.)<BR>
	The bar consists only of domestic and imported beers.  Two bartenders are budgeted for - and two bouncers.  Under the bar, in three different places, are red buttons, designed to be used if and when the police are needed.  When pressed, a computer located in the office will dial 911 and issue a plea for help giving all information to the operator.<BR>
	Behind the bar, there is a large mirror, behind which there is a pane of bulletproof glass, allowing those in the small dressing room there to watch the action of the main club.  From this small room, there is a narrow winding hallway, leading into the 'green room' (originally planned to be a stockroom).  In the green room, there is a cabinet, readied with several bottles of Mace to be used if a customer gets.. overly rowdy.<BR>
	In the office, a plain, wooden desk is set about five feet from the back wall.  On it, there is a computer (internet ready), a phone and an answering machine.  Two plants spice up the room a little; and it is in here that the only clear window is located; the others placed throughout the building having been covered with dark shades.<I><BR>
<BR>
4) Generalized Direction (how it is going to happen)<BR>
</I>Trinity has been saving for the past six years, preparing to open Civitas Dei.  In a bank account, gathering interest, is nearly five hundred thousand dollars, half of which she earned, and the other half the insurance money collected from her husbands (of two months) death.  It is with this money, the building already owned, and some help from other friends (partners if they wish) she hopes to get Civitas opened.  Once it starts looking as there might be a date set for opening, Trinity will start hiring her dancers and other workers.<I><BR>
