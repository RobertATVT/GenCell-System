</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
Luck<I> </I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Gift</B> - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	6'4", 210 pounds, Marck stands extremely tall.  By no means a handsome man, he does, however, have a roughness about him which women seem to find appealing, and a sense of self which makes people take notice. By no means a skinny man, he's very agile, muscles easily seen beneath the tawny golden skin of his highland ancestry.  A master in bed, business, and defence, he has an almost buddist point of view, enjoying life, though not in excess, and trying to find a higher self. However, his root still show above ground occasionally, and he has a ruthlessness of someone who had to fight to succeed in life.  His will to succeed and prosper is evident in the tawny eyes.<BR>
	Usually dresses in chinos and t-shirt, unless doing his business deals, in which case he'll dress as the need determines, is rarely if ever seen in jeans.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>	So, yeah, i was born in Scottland. What of it? Com'ere. Lemme tell ya a li'll somethin somethin. Ah might be a scot, but that means i can beat the livin [ ] outta ya if'n ah wanna. Don' forget that ya' welp. <BR>
	So, where was i? Oh, yeah. I was born in Scottland. Got me two brothers and a sister, somewhere. Well, no, i know where J.J. lives, he's some high and mighty hot shot up in Rodchester, some kinda practi'sh'n-er o' the arts. Fancy name for artist if ya ask me. Oh, and he's married to a hot shot lawyer with a nice set o' jugs, if ya know wha' ah mean. Eh. Me? I jus' sit back and let the money make itself. Got a nice li'le company that buys and sells goods. Started it up back when ma' da' was alive. Not my real da' mind ya, that [ ] is in Scottland somewhere, or least, that's wha' ah reckon, if he ain't dead that is.  <BR>
	So yea, i make a good livin, don' live high on the hog or nothin' but... Eh. No. i ain' poor ya rotten pup! Fact is, i own a bunch of nice shares in some good companies, department stores, computer jives, certain phone companies. I own some here and there, couple million worth maybe. Ah'lahk mah roots though, earnin money, so i keep mos' of it tied up 'less i need it. Bu' i ain' one fah braggin. Anywah' ah got me a sister somewhere, her name's Rory Underhill, and a brothah too, Ashland Underhill. See, it's like this. We lived with a rotten son of a [ ] [ ] [] back when we's were young. Real mean [ ]. He liked hitt'n on us, specially J.J. And he had this thing for Rory. Almost got us all killed, the [ ] did. Luckily though, we got outta there, into foster homes. Not that those are great places or anythin' but J.J. and i found a nice home, they adopted us soon after. Rory and Ash, those two got put in a couple of real bruisers. Finally, they ran away. Mah paren's, only ones i've ever really known anyway, they wen' an tried to adopt um, but the county said two was almost too much anyway. So much for fam'ly values eh? <BR>
	So, Ro and Ash, they finally got smart and left, can't say's ah blaime um much... But, thing is, i know they went New York way, jus' don' know anythin' after that. It's been, well, lemme' recole't. Near sixteen yeah's since ah done seen um or even heard from um.  Tried to find um up in New York, bu' did'n get nowhere much. Found out through some channels they'd been in the city, and that Ash was dead. Shame, he was a good brother. Rory, she kinda dissapeared, real easy to do in a city that size. Found a man, bad sort too, that knew her, said she went back west ways. So, i figured, hay'll, might as well look for her, ain't got much else to do right? So that's why ahm here, searchin for mah sistah. <BR>
