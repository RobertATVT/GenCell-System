    <B>Description:</B>  The savior of drunk drivers and tool of salespeople everywhere.  A silver tongued individual finds it easy to convince others of nearly anything, depending on how well they beat their opponent's roll.  A character cannot be convinced to do something that they'd never do, like give up a family heirloom, dance naked on a table, drop their gun after being shot.  Talking a cop out of giving a character a ticket is a prime example of this skill.  It is not mind control.  It is verbally talking someone into something.  Only a Storyteller can decide how convinced a person is that the explosion of words is truth. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

    <B>Description:</B>  Our capitalistic society insists we accumulate green colored paper with which to purchase goods and services.  Each level of Income represents the amount of money ($15k per level) your character earns in a year.  This money is not an exact figure the character owns.  Rather, it is the symbolic representation of what your character can and cannot afford.  Any time your character wishes to purchase something costing $500 or more, an Income roll is required.  A failed attempt only means your character did not have the means to purchase the item or service at that moment.  The target number increases depending on the cost of the item or services as listed below.  If an income roll is failed, it may be attempted again the next day.  <BR>

    <B>Description:</B> The ability to compose and play music is not the easiest form of employment, but can certainly be satisfying to the individual.  The music skill itself is a rather broad skill.  Therefore, you must select one instrument for your character to be experienced with.  Whether this be a bass, clarinet, oboe, drums or singing, the choice is yours.Success of a writing roll allows the character to write a musical piece that others enjoy and want to listen to.  Successfully making a play roll represents the characters ability to perform a musical composition well, not making mistake, and generally impressing those who listen.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

    <B>System: </B>roll 2d6+Mind+Law Skill Level vs TN (see below)<B><BR>
    Description: </B> Some people know the law and other know how to bend it.  A character that knows the law can attempt to weasel their way out of the situation.  This takes place in the courts since cops don't usually listen to slick talk of law.  "Tell it to the judge," they say.  If arrested and the character goes to court (in email), a Storyteller will be made available to witness the roll above.  If this roll is needed against more than one charge at a time, the player must roll for each charge.  Each charge after the first takes a cumulative -5 penalty.   Listed below is the level of each charge a character can be brought up on (their descriptions are listed in the Law Enforcement Chapter), with it's respective TN.  For every three points the player beats the TN by, the charge is dropped a level.  For instance, EricJohnsn is brought up on charge of attempted murder which is a 2nd degree felony (TN: 22).  Rolling 2d6+Mind+Law, he scores a total of 29.  He beat the target number by 7, which drops the charges by two.  He is instead found guilty of a Class A Misdemeanor.<BR>

Should you purchase Reflexes level 8, you will be able to grab and use one item during combat.  Normally, you have to grab and then use taking two separate actions.  This "quick draw" effect does not require a roll.   You must have enough hands free to wield the weapon in order to quickly ready it.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#030000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

She sspent most of her time as a young child at her Aunt Ama's home when her mother was working.  When she was 8, she started staying at home by herself after school.  She led a normal kid's life, really, other than being considered somewhat strange.<BR>
     She was always gifted in the arts.  She focused mainly on her painting and by the time she was in high school she was able to paint in photo-realisim like a master.  She took classes at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.<BR>
     She started learning guitar as a junior year of high school.  She graduated with a C+ average and began to go to college at SAIC, because she got in for free.<BR>
     She made a little bit of money playing guitar on the streets to pay for art supplies.  She graduated from SAIC with a BFA last year in May.  Her mother gave her a car for a present, a red Volvo.  With this she picked up and decided to go to New Orleans and see what she could do there.  Her car broke down in Isle Voletta one evening.  She decided that the place was interesting and people friendly enough for her to stay a little while.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
