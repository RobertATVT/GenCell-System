These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

		</B>Virginia Andree` Waya was born in a cabin deep within the forest of Washington. Her mother was  Isabelle Vanhorn a french actress that came down from Canada because she fell in love with her father  BlueSky Waya. They builts the cabin to hide away from the world, plus it brought her father peace to be in the world his ancestors once lived. They were married two years before Virginia was born, but during childbirth a few problems occured.  By the time Virginia was presented to the world her mother was already dead  because during the child birth her mother tore something and she died from blood lose. Her mother was buried near the beautiful cherry blossom tree- that her father planted when the house was first built. The tree was still terribly small , but that was the perfect place for her to rest in peace.  So Virginia was left with her father, the only living relative left in her life. He showed her everything about her Native American background and taught her how to listen to nature.  He showed me how to hunt for food, though I should only take what I need to survive with. With each passing day she began to grow and look more and more beautiful. When she finally reached the age of 21 her father became very ill, due to a certain kind of cancer. She tired everything to make him go to a hosptial, but her father told her that she must not worry about him, that he shall soon be with her mother. Within a week he died and was placed near the huge cherry blossom that he planted over 21 years ago. She lived in the cabin for most the following year and continued the nature walks that she used to do all the time with her father.  But one day as she was walking through the forest a man came into view- one she had never seen before. She moved through the woods following him like a mountain lion as he seemed to move to her place. She moved into the path just ahead of the house as the man comes to a dead hault infront of him. <BR>
<BR>
	She soon found out that the man that came to her house was a near by neighbor coming to give his sympathy to her. As the days passed they seemed to be seeing one another more and more. By the end of spring he was going to leave and the feelings that were between them were extremely strong. He had to go away to a college in New Orleans, there he would start to work with his father and go to college. So the day before he was suppose to leave they had a beautiful dinner out in the forest near lake indawin. When he brought her to the clearing a huge fire was a blaze and the blanket was set off to one corner but had no food upon it.  She was so utterly confused as to why the blanket was set out upon the ground and where the dinner was. But soon she heard chanting as she glanced back over at her love- his shirt flung to the side as he started to paint symbols along his chest. He danced around the camp fire the pantings smeared upon his body as I just watch him, moving back from the area. A howl is heard from his lips as his body started to change in a man wolf- something my father use to tell me, but I always thought were myths. His clothes shredded infront of me as a scream echoes from my lips. I start to run but before I get too far  the beast was upon me tearing up my back. I soon passed out into a a deep hole not knowing exactly what happen.<BR>
<BR>
		The next morning I awoke to the rays of light flitering through the trees, with his body next to mine  curled naked in a ball. I touch my back coming away with blood as I try to hold back the tears. I stand slowly trying to get as far away from him as possible afraid of what he was or yet what he did to me. When I got home I got what few objects that I held dear and wrapped my back up so that I could manage not to go to the hospital. Then with the few objects I headed off to the main highway to hitch hike myself out of this place. <BR>
	 	I hitched my way across the many states holding dearly to what little money I had, as  I finally arrived in a small town. I read the sign reading Isle Voletta as we entered the small town. I shrugged to myself my back almost healed as I entered the town - this town is as good as any...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
