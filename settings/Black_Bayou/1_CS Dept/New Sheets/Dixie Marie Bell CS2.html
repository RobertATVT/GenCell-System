</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Whether it is a Lamia's spell, a werewolf's scent or even an angel's true sight.  The demon chooses the breed it wants to be detected as, as long as it has Lore level 1 of that breed.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Born a little before the time of the Civil War, to a family of very rich, or I should say were rather rich, souther white racist planters, her child hood was one of constant segregation toward blacks and Northerners.  This is what fueled her to go down the path she decided to go down.  She had grown up in a family where her father and mother always blammed northern whites and blacks for their families fiscal troubles.  She grew up listening to her parents bad mouth those people.  She was about 19 when the Federal Government decided to remove the troops from the South.  She was close to 20 when she heard about the Ku Klux Klan, and The Redeemers.  She wanted to help, but was unable to because all the people involved in those Social groups were white supremices and thought that a woman was of inequalness to be even considered a member of such a thing.  So she said fine, and went off on her own to try and stop the "black menace" as she put it.    She soon figured out a way to do that, she was going to have to rely upon a source of greater power then even the Redeemers or the Ku Klux Klan, a source that had been around since the beginning of time.  It took her about a year to steal the books she needed, but she was able to do it.   She then began to implement her plan to try and regain the honor of her family.  She though had been an impatient person and had often found ways of cutting corners, and that is what she had done with this ritual as well...She had not completely done the fullness that it had required, she had skimmed over the text and read lightly and so performed the ritual not correctly.  She had little relized that now she was the vessel that the demon would inheriently be conjured into.  She didn't relize this until it manifested itself before her and gave her a proposition, either she be the host..or Lilith, as the demon liked to be known as, would take her soul down to hell with her as a solution for taking her away from her husband when she had.  Dixie agreed to such a thing and soon inherited the power she wanted.  It was perfect.  She then moved away from the South and decided to try and find a suitable place that was better.  It didn't take her long though, maybe about..100 years or so she had wandered until finding Isle Volletta.  She then decided yes..this was the place she would go and stay for a good time, to at least stir up some trouble.<BR>
