<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Gives the psychic the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The psychic may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The psychic may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  They are only a spectator.  The psychic may ask 3 questions in an instant message of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> Name:  Hannah Emory<BR>
 Breed: Psychic<BR>
 Age and/or birth date:  August 18, 1978<BR>
 Eye Color:  Brown<BR>
 Hair:  Chocolate cherry, shoulder-length.<BR>
 Height/weight: 5 foot even<BR>
 Occupation: Writer/Student<BR>
 Equipment/weapons: A necklace with three crystals bound together by sterling silver. A leather-bound journal. <BR>
 Appearance (clothes, etc.):  Slender build; ivory complexion. Sterling silver jewelry. Favors an assorted wardrobe.<BR>
<BR>
 Background:  <BR>
Hannah was born and raised in Biloxi, Mississippi, and was the only child of Charles and Veronica. She was their pride and joy, which is why it nearly broke their heart's to learn that their daughter was born with a severe hearing impairment, which also resulted in a speech impairment. Hoping to make their lives as easy as possible, Veronica decided to teach Hannah how to use telepathy, taking advantage of the Psychic nature which thrived in the maternal side of the family. They wanted to shelter Hannah as much as possible from the harsh world around, which included home-schooling and strict rules.<BR>
<BR>
The life Hannah led was considered "normal" for her, but was not normal in the least. Since she used telepathy to communicate; her knowledge of lip-reading and sign language were poor. She desired to learn more about the psychic ability which dated back to the days of the witch trials, but the family refused to teach her anymore. They only provided her with enough information to "get by" in life. This was not acceptable to Hannah.<BR>
<BR>
When Hannah turned 18, she decided to leave home and go search and experience what the world had to offer. More specifically, she wanted to know more about psychics and her family's involvement. Her travels landed her in New Orleans, which had an abundance of information on folklore and the occult. Intense study on Psychic ability led her to information on lamia, vampires, and werewolves. Hannah found something she was interested in. <BR>
<BR>
Sometimes she uses her disability to her advantage; listening to conversations when people think you cannot hear can provide one with many interesting tidbits of info. Since she left home, she has learned how to communicate and cope with her disability, which she sometimes refers to as her "ability." Hannah can partially hear, but that depends on the environment and her emotional state; she can also speak, but it is muffled and difficult to understand, in addition to which, she does not like the way she sounds. <BR>
<BR>
All of her knowledge is documented in her journal, which she hopes to turn into a book one day. The focus of her energy is her necklace, which she is never seen without. It was given to her by a wise old woman that instructed Hannah about the occult and directed her towards Voletta. Seek and ye shall find.<BR>
