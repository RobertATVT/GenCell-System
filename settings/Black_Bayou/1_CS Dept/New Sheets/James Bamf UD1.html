These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

<B>Advantage:</B>  Although often eccentric and seem to do things apparently strange to us as they create, authors have that special gift that turns creativity into works of art.  Therefore, authors gain +3 to any Writing rolls they attempt.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>James was born in New York in 1974.  He lived a comfortable and quite normal life until he was 18.  One mid-winter night in 1992, James found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He had been snooping around where he shouldn't have been, in an old warehouse that he'd thought to be abandoned.  As it turned out, there were people there--two gangsters and a woman.  The woman was tied to a chair, and the two men didn't seem to be her friends.  They both had guns, and though he knew better, he couldn't just stand by and watch it happen.  He stayed hidden behind several old, empty crates, grabbed a rock from the floor, and threw it across the room.  Both men looked up, and one instructed the other to go check out whatever the noise was.  One of them turned to walk the other way, and James took out his 9mm.  He aimed carefully, and put down the one who'd walked away.  The other walked toward his wounded friend, with his gun drawn, and James shot him, too.  He rescued the woman, called the police, and quickly left town.  <BR>
	He lived the next few years of his life in New Orleans, living a fairly normal life.  He met and fell in love with a woman named Bella, and then with her sister.  Then he met yet another woman when he turned 24.  And then his life got really crazy.  <BR>
	The woman's name was Kayla.  She was a werewolf.  James learned all about werewolves from her.  About keeping them away, about killing them, about how their true form came out during times of extreme agitation and during a full moon.  And then he learned about the packs.  There was terrible competition among the packs.  They were constantly at war with each other.  This seemed all well and good to James until he saw the destruction that could be caused by these wars.  Innocent people could be caught in the way.  As Kayla's lover, James was in danger himself.  Lives could be lost, and the property damage was devestating.  When Kayla was murdered by another wolf, he swore he'd had enough.  He loaded his gun with silver bullets, and began to slay as many wolves as he could.  And when he thought he'd done enough there, he decided to go to a town Kayla had spoken of where other wolves could be found.  And that is when he came to Isle Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>  <BR>
