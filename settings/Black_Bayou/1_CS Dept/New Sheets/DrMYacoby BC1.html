<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

	Small, Intelligent and above all, Serious.  She arrives in Voletta after a being relieved from her position with FBI and the "Fallen" case.  Born into a family of true law abiding citizens, it was Melissa's duty to her family to take a position in law.  However, instead of following in her father's footsteps and becoming a lawyer, Lissa majored in Medicine fulfilling her wanting to be a doctor.  But as time passed, Lissa became disinterested in medical practice, and found herself leaning toward her duty, law.  Instead of dropping medical school, Lissa continued and began taking classes in Law and Criminal Justice.  After graduating from college at age 26, Melissa began her first job at the law firm owned by her father.  After her first case, her father decided that she wasn't fit for an attorney.  She gathered information well but she could not handle herself in court.  Melissa found herself lost, unable to be lawyer or a doctor, or could she?  She disliked having to deal with people for long periods of time, but those people were living.  She started her first job in medicine as a coroner's assistant.  He was a long time professional in forensic science, and taught Melissa everything about forensic medicine.  After two years of autopsies and investigating crime scenes, the coroner died mysteriously in a car accident.  Melissa replaced the coroner and was required to perform the autopsy on her former boss.  What she discovered was shocking.  According to the results, her boss was long dead before the car accident.  Futhermore, his entire body had been almost completely drained of its blood and was decomposing at an amazing rate.  Three days after the death of her boss, the body disappeared from the morgue.  Baffled why anyone would do such a thing, Melissa looked to the FBI for answers.  She was turned away and told that any information relating to that case was now classified.  The cause of death was deemed an accident.  Two months later, while she was working in her office at the morgue, she received a phone call.  The voice on the other side sounded remarkably like her former boss and told her that she'd best forget what she saw or risk the same fate as him.  Chilled, Melissa left the building and made way to her car.  On the way she was attacked, the man had to be her boss, but it wasn't possible, he was dead.  But he was dead, or rather undead.  He readied to embrace her but was interrupted by a security officer who heard Melissa's screams.  The next morning she was visited in the hospital by the FBI.  She was immediately given access to the information she'd requested and hired to work on the "Fallen" case.  As she delved into the information put before her, she was shocked that a whole other race of people have been living among humans for centuries.  She also found a hit list, locations of "Fallen" who had a record and were kept under constant watch by the FBI.  One of these places was Voletta.  There were other hit lists - other breeds - for Voletta, too, but she was denied access to this information. Two years into her work, she was contacted at her office.  This time, it was a group of vigilantes, vampire hunters, who were in fact an underground group run by the FBI.  This group was hoping to that Melissa would leak information about the location of certain vampires.  She refused and never heard from the group again.  Six months later, the underground group was uncovered by the CIA and traced back to Melissa.  To avoid an international incident, Melissa was relieved of her position, despite the fact she had done nothing wrong.  She chooses Voletta off the hit list and moves to the town in hopes of picking up her work once again, with or without the help of the FBI.  <BR>
