 These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> The psychic has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the psychic to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the psychic is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the psychic must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Gives the psychic the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The psychic may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The psychic may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  They are only a spectator.  The psychic may ask 3 questions in an instant message of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Background:  Born in Bangor, Maine to the parents of Lilth Desdemona and Paul Desdemona.  She had an odd child hood.  While growing up when she was young she found she could communicate with her parents when she couldn't talk at all.  Later on as she aged so did her knowledge.  Soon she learned why and how she could communicate with her parents when they couldn't communicate back.  She then learned the rest of the "powers" she had been embued with.  Such as learning to read facial patterns.  She also learned how to sheild herself from somethings.  She soon advanced in her learning and when she was about 14 she learned how to read minds.  She loved the ability.  She could read the person's thoughts and learn almost everything about them.  It was a wonderful gift.  She soon began to write about her various experiences with her powers and found she loved it.  She graduated from high school at age 17, and went onto college when she was 18.  She went to University Of Maine located in Orono, Maine, the same college as great novelist and master of horror , Stephen King.  She studied there learning about the english language and how to best write things down.  She studied there for about 5 years learning about all the various things.  How to best write articles essays novels.  She graduated from the University Of Maine when she was 23.  She then spent the next five years publishing short stories and a few cheesy novels.  After hearing of some odd happenings down in a place called Volletta she figured it would be worth enquiring about to see if perhaps she couldn't find some new information or perhaps get a few ideas about how she should go ahead and write  her next novel on. So on down to Volletta she went to see what she could learn for her next novel.   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
