Unfortunately, you were more than a month late on your Update and the CS had been rendered Inactive. However, I was able to find your last Approved CS, so here it is. I'm afraid the extra XP you had earned was lost, due to the CS going Inactive, but you still have the 47XP that was banked.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trance-like state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occured after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Born on June 10th, 1976 in Atlanta Georgia. Grew up with her mother and sister. Never met her father, but recived letters from him. A product of an affair, she had no place in his life really. She graduated from Pepprell High School. Went on to Junior college for two years. Had a steady job, a  boyfriend that treated her like crap and was ready to leave it all. One day she recived a letter from her father before he died stating that she had a brother in Voletta La. She figured this was her big chance and left Georgia to find him.<B><I><BR>
