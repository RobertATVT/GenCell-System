    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
    Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
    Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)<BR>

    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
    Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
    Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

    <B>System/Duration: </B>NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
    <B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between family members, vampires have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The vampire can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance.  Each family member must have the mastery Call The Family to be included in the Mindspeak.  The family must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Sandra Collette Pernelle was born in the good ole Marrerro, Louisiana on February 16, 1976.  Ah, the cheerleading days were such bliss for her.  From elementary school all the way through high school at John Ehret High School (Go Patriots!), she wore that uniform with pride!  Sure, study study study...she -was- a straight A student...it was just...academics seemed second best to her life, and she would have never done as good in any of her classes without shopping with the gals, catching a movie with her friends, parties, cheering practice, all the recreation a girl could ever want!  Sandra even dabbled in writing here and there--Dear Diary and even a random school newspaper article...most likely on trends in fashion or other social issues facing America's growing teens.  After graduation, she moved on to college, which was, to her, a cakewalk, being that her high school was rather competitive.  She had even -more- time for recreation, which was her ultimate goal.  Now...what to be, what to be...  She managed to switch majors a total of 5, maybe 6 times before eventually deciding on majoring in English and minoring in writing.  So...graduation day came and went and...well...what does one do with and English major/ex-cheerleader/all around peppy chick?  Well she became a personal assistant in a large office, of course, but this was all in her good ole home town, which she returned to right after college.  She had to break free!  The binds of family and friends was nearly strangling!  So, after turning in her resignation at the office, she skooted into her Miada and headed off for a random town, selected by placing her finger on a map of Louisiana.  "Isle Voletta...heh...haven't really heard of it, but, eh, what the hell!"  She turned the key in her ignition, checked to see that she still had daddy's "emergency" credit card, her fashionable blue Smart Beep beeper, and her little motorola cell phone, and then she set out to join the regulary joe's of Isle Voletta.<BR>
