<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

        </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Morrighan was born on June 19, 1973 in Pennsylvania. Her parents, Samuel and Alyson MacSeoin, tried to provide her with every priviledge growing up, and had the money to do so. Morrighan attended private schools for all of her educational needs, went to the best summer camps, wore designer clothes, and had expensive toys. And she was everything that her parents had tried to mold her into, until she met Alex Parry. Alex was a musician in a heavy metal band, and very stereotypical of the genre. He let loose a wild side of Morrighan that had been squelched by her parents for a long 16 years. For 2 years, they dated behind Mr. and Mrs. MacSeoin's backs. Morrighan sang for Alex's band, Distant Thunder. A band that eventually received a write up in a local paper, which Morrighan's parents read. A heated arguement broke out and ended with Morrighan turning her back on her overbearing parents and leaving her life of wealth behind for the prospect of both love and fame.<BR>
         <BR>
         The next year was the most traumatic of Morrighan's life. Alex, after two years, virtually turned into a monster. He would beat her relentlessly for the most insignifigant violations of his "rules." She tried to leave him and return to her parents, but they turned her away to "learn your own lessons." Eventually, the only thing that was left that gave her any happiness at all was the stage. Perhaps it was that newfound dedication that gave Distant Thunder the edge that was needed to land themself a record deal and the opening spot on a small tour. On that tour, Morrighan fell in love with the state of Louisiana and decided that after the tour, she would take whatever money she had coming to her from that and record sales and get away from Alex for good. <BR>
         <BR>
         Morrighan moved to Isle Voletta, information that only Katherine Bishop; her close friend still residing in Philadelphia, has. Hoping to make a fresh start, she bought a house, a car, and began advertising to begin a new career in music. <BR>
       <BR>
            However, since she moved to Voletta, Morrighan's life took an incredible turn. She tried to deal with the things she was seeing, but it became harder and harder. She literally thought she was losing her mind until the night one thing became very real to her......the night she was turned into a vampire. Since that night, nothing was the same. She hid it from her friends as much as she could, telling only a few who she couldn't stand lying to. She has since abandoned the idea of making a career for herself in music, not wanting the fame that it could possibly attract if she were to succeed. Instead, she went to work at MMI. <BR>
