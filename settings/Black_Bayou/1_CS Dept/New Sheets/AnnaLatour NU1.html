<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.   They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Over time, the vampire can learn to expand and direct the nature of its inner beast during times of stress.  This monstrous energy can then be directed toward the vampire's physical form, causing the beast form of a vampire to emerge.  In vamporos form the vampire's body expands beyond the bounds of its human shape.  The vampire becomes massive, standing nearly eight feet tall.  Its body is skeletal, any clothes the vampire wore would be ripped and hanging loosely from its body.  The face elongates sharply from forehead to chin and cheek to cheek.  The vampire's eyes shrink to mere slits, the pupils glowing an eerie red.  Wicked gleaming fangs hang below the bottom lip and the nails harden into sharp claws.  The vampire's mind explodes with anger and passion, almost completely overriding rational thought.  It can formulate simple thoughts and speak crude, guttural English (or other language depending on its homeland).  Vampires can feed normally in this form.  While in this form, the vampire gains +2 Body. <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>  A bruised angel, Annabelle stands at a fragile 5'6", straight glossy blond hair falling past her shoulder blades in a cascade of silver light.  Her eyes are the color of deep sea, fringed with sandy lashes. Her eyebrows are thin and gold, her eyelids dusted with pale violet powder.  Her lips are soft and pouty under a thin coating of cherry flavored gloss, parting only for the briefest flash of teeth, most often hidden behind one hand.  She is seemingly innocent, with a perpetually lost expression that invokes a protective nature in some, and has made her the victim of others.  Soft spoken and very pale, she can most often be found in worn low slung boot cut jeans and steel toed boots. She wears little teeshirts in soft pastel colors, dark blue or black, avoiding bright colors like the plague. Over these she wears (or more likely lives in) a little dark blue corderouy jacket, and in the winter, a somewhat weatherbeaten navy peacoat about a size too big for her.  In her pockets she carries a pack of cloves and a silver zippo with her sire's name engraved on one side and since scratched beyond recognition, multiple packs of matches taken from various restaraunts, clubs, and bars from Chicago to New Orleans, a switchblade with a 4 inch blade, and a gold chinese dragon on the handle, house keys , a tiny travel size bottle of Mint Burst Listerine for use after the kill, and anything interesting she found on the body of her victim that night (inanimate objects - jewelry, cash).  She is without jewelry with the exception of the engagement ring on her left hand, a round cut diamond edged by two garnets.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   Annabelle began her life, April 20, 1974, in the garden district of New Orleans, the daughter of a wealthy business man Marcel Latour, and his wife Charlotte. Although her mother was fairly uninvolved in the early life of her child, her father was absolutely devoted.  He spoiled her with everything she could possibly want, including an English Setter puppy she named Misty.  Despite his long hours at work, he remained his only daughter's hero.  When Annabelle was four, her father suddenly disappeared (the victim of a not so car accident), and she was forced to move to Chicago with her mother and mother's lover William. William had been with Charlotte since high school, and drove the car that assisted in pushing Marcel to his death. To the outside world, he did not seem a particularly bad man.  He was firm and tended not to smile, but friends and neighbors never thought much of it.  They looked the other way when he would come home drunk and pretend not to notice the bruises on Annabelle and her mother. <BR>
  <BR>
  Despite physical, sexual and emotional abuse she suffered at home, Annabelle was generally able to put on a normal face for the rest of the world.  She developed a problem of bedwetting, fidgiting and compulsive cleansing, sometimes seriously burning herself or suffering severe blood loss in an effort to become "clean," but these rarely interfered with school, or became obvious enough that anyone took the time to question them.  She was a very intelligent child, and excelled in subjects that interested her, but in the first two years of high school became more and more disturbed.  When she became a junior in high school she spent more and more time away from home.  Bill punished her for these infractions, but even moreso when he began to believe she was considering running away from home.  As with many abusers, he also took out his anger on Annabelle's dog, Misty, and in a drunken rage, put a hammer through the animal's skull, along with a nail through each of her paws.  With the death of her dog, and the only piece of her father she had been left with, Anna gathered up a few articles of clothing, her journal and the stash of money she kept under her bed and hopped a CTA bus going south.  When the bus reached its final destination, she walked along the highway, waiting for somebody to pick her up.  When she eventually reached New Orleans, a little worse for wear, she began to search for her father, discovering instead a worn tomb and forgotten plot in a New Orleans cemetary.  The remaining cash she had on her she spent on three yellow roses, which she carefully rid of thorns before setting beside his tomb.<BR>
  <BR>
  With a dollar and seven cents remaining, she wandered the streets of New Orleans, confused, alone and without a place stay.  In search of salvation, a shelter for lost children, she found instead a dirty, crumbling hotel and a new occupation.  It was nothing new to Annabelle; when the owner and new manager took her to his bed she closed her eyes and clenched her fists like she had with Bill, detatched herself from the physical reality and thought of clouds.  Anna fell into the company of several other girls with whom she shared a small room and a few ruined mattresses.  By night she haunted streets or corners or alleyways, got into cars with men who most likely had wives and children at home, and was called by every name imaginable.  She slept with her manager and his associates when it was called for, and discovered the use of illegal narcotics to "ease her pain".  <BR>
   <BR>
  Several years later, Anna was arrested in an FBI sting operation, where she met and fell in love with Special Agent Andy Trask.  After her somewhat rough handling, Andy brought her to a clinic to have her injuries tended to, and then to court, where she was given a suspended sentence.  He attempted, without success, to make her return home to her parents, then reluctantly let her go, where she would later be collected and return to business as usual.<BR>
   <BR>
  A year later she was given to Michael Marino, an associate of her manager, to help make up for the unexpected death of a "mule" and the loss of several thousand dollars worth of cocaine.  Michael was possessive, and enjoyed beating her to unconsciousness or allowing his friends to do the same.  However, Annabelle's fragile body could not withstand the broken ribs and bruising and once, after Michael had disposed of his rage on her 5'6" frame, he found he could only revive her with the giving of his blood, with which he transformed her into something inhuman and immortal.  Once her death was no longer a consideration, he became less careful with how he hurt her, demeaned her, and punished her.  Anna submitted to all of this, aiding to her own torment by cutting herself as she did when she was younger, in the hopes of making herself clean.<BR>
  <BR>
  Several years later, she found the courage to run away again, this time finding the Island of Voletta, where in a crowded nightclub she met Jean DeLeon, another of her kind, who promised absolute devotion with no strings attatched. Michael caught up with her several weeks after her arrival, stalking her as if for sport, and cornering her in an alley in the Industrial section of Voletta.  Pressed up against a brick wall, with the blade of Michael's daggar to her throat, Anna played upon his belief that his possessiveness was really love, and took advantage of his temporary loss of concentration by taking the daggar from his hand, kicking him off of her, and burying it in his throat.  Terrified and furious and on the brink of insanity, she stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest, cracking open his ribcage and cutting away his heart.  As the rage subsided, she wiped off his blood and set fire to his body.  Lighting a cigarette off his flaming remains, she left to find Jean.  Anna later married Jean, under the assumption that because he did not beat her, he was the man for her.  She later discovered the error in her thinking.  Jean wanted to inflict onto others the very thing she abhorred, and in subconscious retaliation, Anna found other men to share her bed. Her first and most significant lover was a vampire named Sarkis Teft, whom she would have left Jean for had he not been involved with another woman.<BR>
   <BR>
  Several months later Sarkis died in an explosion just as Anna's husband Jean left her to find his sire. Anna took her frustration out on herself as she did when she was young with the use of her switch blade, hoping that by hurting herself physically, she might block out her mental anguish.  The next few nights she spent in a state of half conciousness, lost and drained of blood.  One night, as her darkness and confusion had begun to clear, she stumbled into the Symposium, where she found Andy Trask, whom she had been in love with since she had met him 4 years before.  Feeling sorry for her, Andy offered her a place to stay, and eventually returned her love.  The two were engaged for nearly two years when Andy was kidnapped and killed.  Her protector and only source of self esteem gone, Anna is currently moving between denial and depression, trying to find a way to live on her own.<BR>
