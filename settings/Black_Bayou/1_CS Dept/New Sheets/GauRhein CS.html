 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
 <B><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  2d6+Will vs. 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate. <BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Some mortals seem to be blessed with a natural affinity toward animals.  With the use of this mastery, a mortal can calm an animal and befriend him for a time, be it wild or tame.  Simple, one word verbal commands given to the animal will be understood.  The duration can be extended with the expenditure of extra soul, no re-roll is necessary.  Shepherd's Aura has the potential to affect a breed while it is in an animal form, including Horus.  In any case, if the roll is against a player character, then the roll is vs the targets 2d6+Will.  These feelings tend to carry over to the mortal form and are viewed as "good vibes."<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> Background:  The Rheinholts had been a prominent family in Germany for centuries.  With a past both famous, and shrouded in mystery, legends were abound throughout.  Some said they were vampires, or werewolves.  Others said that they were a line of heroes, champions against the dark.  The questions were numerous, but all remained the same.  Unanswered.<BR>
    There was another legend, one that some claimed was entertwined with the family Rheinholt.  A tale of a dark cult of druids, secretly influencing events throughout history.  It was said that they would steal away children when they were very young, taking them to the underground temples, raising them to their own will.  They had many names throughout the many villages and cities.  The Dark Ones.  The Child-Theives.  The Blood-Takers.  Worshippers of the Night.<BR>
    This tale, was more then just a story.<BR>
    It was an acolyte of the Dark Ones that stole into the Rheinholt estate late that night, when Gauren was only one year old.  He moved with the stealth of shadows</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>, past trained dogs that didn't hear or smell him, past state of the art security systems without so much as a blip, to the nursery where Gauren slept, and took the sleeping child.  Noone even knew he was there until he was gone.<BR>
    But something else sensed him, and had ever since he had left the temple hours before.  And it would find him.<BR>
    The acolyte had run far through the woods, dodging across snowbanks and frozen rivers, using every trick he knew to escape his pursuers.  Something...vicious...terrible... followed him through those woods, moving like the winds.  He changed course, and it even when it couldn't see him it still changed directions with him, perfectly...tracing...searching...<BR>
    Hunting.<BR>
    The wolf tore into the acolyte before he even had a chance to react.  It was a quick, clean kill, his jugular pierced before he even had time to scream.  The wolf started to feed...then stopped, as his attention was turned to a small cry, from the bundle the man had been carrying.<BR>
    Perhaps, had it been any child other then Gauren, the wolf would have killed him, too.  All instinct normally would have told him so.  But...oddly...something was different about that small boy, different from all humans the wolf had ever before encountered.  In a small, almost indistinguishable way...he smelled...different.  Not wrong, the way most humans did, but...almost like pack.<BR>
    The wolf was incredible in size, even for the already large wolves of the mountains, and carried the infant Gauren easily back to the lair.  The whole pack felt what the Alpha had, the strange kinship, something that tugged in a deep part of them.  They accepted the babe as their own, raising him among them.  He grew to be fiercely strong, lean and tough, able to survive in any environment.  He learned to hunt, to kill, with his bare hands, as fiercely as any of the pack.<BR>
    Just this year, at the beginning of March, Gauren was discovered by a team of wildlife researchers.  Though it took an entire team, one of which was killed by the pack in the process, they tranquilized Gauren, and brought him in for study.  After a week, he was transferred to a high security research center in Louisana.<BR>
    The guards, majorly underestimated his ability to escape.<BR>
    He roams Louisana now, lost and confused, trying to find his pack.  Until, one night, he happens on Voletta, and may find himself even more lost and confused...<BR>
