 The men and women in blue, justice over all, highly trained and fully equipped to handle every crisis.  Well, almost any crisis. The modern day heroes.  Anyone can be an ex-officer, but only those that get hired by the Sheriffs Department are active officers in-character.<BR>

 <B>Advantage:</B>   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

   System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
   Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

   System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
   Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
   System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
   Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>1977.  The end of a turbulent time in American history.  The beginning of Lauren M. Green.<BR>
    	Lauren Green was born in Wichita, Kansas to Karen and Elijah Green.  Her parents has been flower children.  They'd been to Woodstock, dropped acid and shot heroin.  They'd driven around the country in a VW van.  They'd made love under the stars, high on every drug they could get their hands on.  And out of that had come Lauren and after that, her 5 brothers and sisters, Lucy, Larry, Linda, Laine and Lorne.  L had meant loneliness in an ancient culture and each child symbolized a little less loneliness for the others.<BR>
    	Her parents had also managed to attend college.  They retained mediocre jobs.  Her father worked in an auto plant and her mother became a secretary.  On the ouside, her family looked fairly normal, but on the inside, it was far from it.<BR>
    	Her parents had never actually kicked their drug habits and spent hours, drikning and partying.  Lauren had raised her brothers and sister virtually on her own, also playing a nurse to her often drunk and high parents.<BR>
    	This went on until Lauren was 11.  On night, one of 7 year old, Larry's teachers came by the house after failing to reach Mr. or Mrs. Green despite trying for 2 weeks.  She discovered the house in a squalled state.  11-year-old Lauren cooking and helping her younger brothers and sisters with their homework, feeding 1-year-old Lorne.  The police were phoned immediately and the children were sent to live with their childless aunt and uncle.<BR>
    	Within the courts raged a custody battle for the next 2 years and on the night before her 13th birthday, permanent custody of the Green children were awarded to her aunt and uncle, after her parents failed to complete their 4th and final round of treatment.  After spending so much time in the presence of cops, Lauren decided to become one and entered college for a 2-year Criminal Justice program.  Then, she entered a local police academy and spent the next 2 years completing there.  Upon graduation, she heard of the Isle Voletta Police Department and decided to head down to check it out, despite the fact that she'd have to go through another round of training, she needed out.  And out she went.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
