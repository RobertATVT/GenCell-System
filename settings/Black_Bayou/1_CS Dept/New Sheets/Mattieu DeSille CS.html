    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing </B>-  0 Soul to use. (no room command needed)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
    Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> <B>Horus Form</B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
    Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Mindspeak</B> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
    Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Wolf Form</B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##WolfForm##)<BR>
    System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
    Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
    <BR>
    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

He is not heavily muscled, nor quite tall, and does not carry about him anything of importance to explain the fear that others have for him.  The colors of auburn and burnished copper interlace in his hair, which often is spiked and mussed from the weather or his fidgety hands.  Generally, he dresses in three colors:  black, wine, or white, and sometimes all three at once.  He is prone to overdressing, and will wear suits to places where it might not be necessary.  There are many distinguishing marks to him, a fact that he dislikes.  There is a tattoo of a sitting angel of suicide on his right thigh, just below the hip, which is about three inches by three and a half inches.  There is a five inch scar on his upper back, crossing over his right shoulder blade, and a eight inch long scar down his left calf.  Both are from the same knife fight. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <B><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Background: </B>Born to Francoise and Patric de Sille in Brest, France, he was raised in a relaxed, aristocratic background.  His tastes, even from the beginning, ran towards art, and he soon had developed the beginnings of a collection.  This collection grew as he became older, and eventually he became a "connoiseur of the arts".  However, to support himself he turned to the lovely land of extortion.  This lovely and engaging practice soon led him to amass quite a fortune, which he saved and spent wisely.  <BR>
      He soon was recruiting artists to come under his wing and be represented.  One of these artists was Christine St. Lucien.  Soon, he made the ultimate mistake:  he fell in love.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
