</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Empathy</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Empathy <target>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> A few Psychics have found another way to use mindspeak.  By increasing the telepathic flow toward a subject, they can over load their mind.  If this is kept up, or if it is powerful enough, then the target may eventually fall unconscious.  This buildup causes intense feedback, like white noise dealing 5 points of Mind damage.  Due to the great mental force and Psychic energy put into the attack, a Psychic may not perform any masteries the round following a Mental Blast.  The victim must be within line of sight.<BR>

Standing 5'9 1/2" barefoot, she has a good figure, her stats coming in at 34 (D) - 24 - 35.  Leigh's shoulder length dark brown hair and deep brown eyes accentuate the deep olive tone of her skin.  She has a few tattoos:  a butterfly on her right buttock,  a koala bear on her ankle (remnants of an early love affair), and a snowflake on her left breast.  She keeps herself neat, street clothes kept separate from club clothes and her makeup reflects the same.<BR>

Abandoned by her birth mother just days after being born, she was raised in an orphanage as a ward of the state of New York.  Seedy, dirty, and totally forgotten by society-at-large, the orphanage would shape Leigh's view of the world around her.  She came to view her surroundings as her lot in life for some sin or crime achieved for something either she or her parents had perpetrated.  <BR>
<BR>
All manners of abuse were heaped on her, her precocious and intelligent persona as well as her physical beauty as a young child, and later as a maturing teen luring any mature male to her.  She lost her virginity at 5 at the hands of a child-molesting maintenance man and was raped repeatedly, finally to the point of near death at 14 by the boyfriend of the "child-care" expert who ran the orphanage.  The rapist was found brain dead, attributed at the time to an aneurism of the brain.  Misty felt no satisfaction in her defense of the rape, however, and had little control over her innate and later acquired gifts until she'd escaped the horrors of the orphanage at 18.<BR>
<BR>
Upon being turned out by the state of New York into Manhattan's streets, she found herself working as a clerk in New Age bookstore/coffeehouse as well as dancing nightly at several strip clubs.  Her mind became educated in her gifts at the coffeehouse, and her education continued in a different vein at the strip clubs.  She learned how talented she was, not only in the minds of men, but how they could be manipulated physically as well.  She learned to defend herself physically, and polished some of her mental gifts as well.<BR>
<BR>
At 22, she had saved enough money to enter school, and winning a grant, she ventured south to Louisiana, to attend school, with the need to continue her education, in all aspects.<BR>
