Who doesn't trust their 'tender?  An icon from 80s television and classic movies, the bartender has become someone we believe in, someone we confide in...well, let's face it, someone we spill our guts to.  And someone we've trusted when they stood in front of us, pouring drinks as we made scandalous deals with dark figures.  What do they know?  What could they bring down on us if they just bothered to find reason?<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

   Jonothan has jaw length golden brown hair and hazel green eyes with flecks of gold.  He tends to wear jeans, t-shirts, and flannels along with his black airwalks, a Fossil watch, a small silver hoop earing in his left ear, and a Pagan charm hanging from a black chord around his neck.  When dressing up you'll usually find him in an Armani or Hugo Boss suit.  He's about 5'9, 125 lbs, skinny but it's all muscle.  He has lightly tanned skin and a 2 inch scar on his right hip.  He's 22 years old.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   Jonothan woke up to a perfect view of the overcast Louisianan sky on Feb. 23, 1998.  He quickly sat up, and regretted it, as the blood rushed from his head and he got a nasty headache.  His first thought was "Where am I?" but that was soon answered as he saw the sign up ahead that read 'Isle Voletta-2 Miles'.  He scratched his head and shook out the bits and pieces of dried mud and twigs.  As he pulled his hand away he noticed a particularly bright color staining it.  His hand had crimson smeared around the brown dust that littered it.  Horrified, he quickly wiped his hand on his jeans and was about to crawl over to a small puddle to make sure he was all right when a more pressing question entered his mind.  "Who was he?"  His hands grasped the tiny knapsack that was laying next to him and dug through its contents.  The first thing he came across was a rolled up sheet of drawing paper with a message scrawled across it in blood.  It read: "Jonothan, don't go home.  -Alex-"  His eyes widened silently as he stared at the cryptic message.  He wondered where the blood to write that had come from.  But that question was, too, soon answered as he glanced down at a bandaged hand.  "Was it his writing?"  He snatched a pen from out of his backpack and tested this theory but it was not his writing.  So he must be Jonothan.  But who was this Alex person and why could he not return home, wherever that was?  The whole experience was unnerving.  He rummaged through the knapsack for more clues, only to find changes of clothes, a bag of trail mix, a copy of Romeo and Juliet with Harvard stamped on the inside cover, an article about bartending, a sketchbook filled with charcoal drawings and poems, a few charcoal pencils and another pen, a card from '97 that read: "Happy 22nd Birthday, Jono!  Love, Keller", and a string of Mardi Gras beads.  He looked again at the article and hundreds of combinations filled his head--how to make a White Russian, a Sex on the Beach, etc.  He was tempted to try to find out his identity by going to the local Sheriff's department but an overwhelming sense of foreboding filled his body at the very idea.  Something had happened and it was best he left his past alone until he remembered more about himself.  Well if he was going to start a new life he'd at least need a name.  He peered over at the book that was among the knapsack's contents.  His new name would be Jonothan Romeo Montague from now on and maybe he could find a job bartending somewhere on that isle up ahead.  He quickly packed up his things and shouldered his knapsack, heading down the road towards the sleepy little town.<BR>
