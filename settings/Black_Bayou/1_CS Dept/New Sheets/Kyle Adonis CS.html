 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 (Prince)Kyle Adonis<BR>
 <BR>
 Hair: Jet black<BR>
 Eyes: Sapphire&Jade<BR>
 Height: 5'10"<BR>
 Weight: 172 lbs.<BR>
 Age: 19(and three quarters)  He is so young because of the SL he is involved with.  He'll be 20 in January.<BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
 Background:<BR>
 <BR>
 It was unexpected.  A baby boy, that they didn't want.  Amy and Geoff Adonis, young and naive as to the life they were inflicting upon their son.  They birthed him into the Court.  An organization of downtrodden, and tattered people, that would roam unnoticed until the last ages of time.  Amy had been only sixteen and the time, and Geoff five years her senior.  It was protected sex, they swear it.  But, he was born.  Kyle, the child they didn't want.  Beautiful from the start, his name said what was meant to be.  Adonis.  The child everyone sought in mythology, he was well liked, despite the raunchy attitude given towards everyone.  At the age of six he brought home a slayed skunk; at the age of nine he brought home a deer.  No one taught him right from wrong, and no one loved him.  His parents neglected him, leaving him to wander sewer grates, and live off scraps others wanted to give him.  He was literally homeless and without family, aside from the others in the Court.  Mag and Lila were his only friends, if they could even be called that.  They were more... people who put up with his behavior.  Amy and Geoff surely didn't.  By the age of eleven, they wouldn't speak to him.  He was disband from their heritage, and alone once again.  The little food they had from whatever they dealt late at night was not offered, and the cardboard box they had taken to was no longer big enough for him.  On the streets by the age of fifteen, and all the worse for wear.<BR>
 	So he left.  He left Voletta, and the Court, without so much as a good-bye.  Kyle knew he would pay for it if he should ever return(He did not plan on it), but he left anyway.  Scoundrel of the streets, hitchhiking got him only so far.  He was restless, hungry, tired, and frustrated.  It wasn't until the next month that things got bad.  Real bad.  It was maybe April when he lost control, perhaps a month or so before, but he didn't know until he saw her.  Her name had been unknown, even to her.  But, she was drop-dead gorgeous in his eyes.  And he wanted her.  He wanted her so badly that he could feel the taste of her flesh pushing against his mouth and down his body to places he didn't know could feel that way.  It was new to him, at his age.  And he would have her.  And then he would get caught.<BR>
 	The rape occured, and he did suceed, but with penalty.  She put off a valiant fight, striking and biting all the way down to the dirty gravel where he stripped her clothing.  Her screams were futile, and people had come running.  He was caught, and she was naked, and he was pleased .  Very pleased.  <BR>
 	Kyle Adonis spent the next four and a half years in prison.  A juvenile district where they treated you as badly as if you were a grown man.  He had committed something atrocious, and he knew it by the dailing beatings, and the rapes that occured against him... by other males.  However, it didn't break him, this experience, but made him colder, harder, and more adept to those around him.  He learned how to fight, and he learned it well.  After some time, the beating stopped, and he was let rest.  Good behavior was what let him out early, and the rest is history.  He had nowhere to go, and Voletta seemed safe.<BR>
 	It hadn't changed, but he wasn't sure if the Court was still in existence.  He wasn't sure if his parents were alive(and he didn't care - but he would when he saw their bodies mutilated by something he could not explain), and he wasn't sure where Lila and Mag had ventured off to.  He was a traitor, and he knew it.  But, he was home.  And home is where he shall stay.<BR>

 Description: <BR>
 <BR>
 Ashes to ashes; Dust to dust - the Adonis has returned. Smouldering sinew of perilous ash dangling at the edge of cancer, glowing crimson in the shadowy night. Nothing too great for the one who resides in greatness. Nest of jet atop a stubbled visage, furrowing over eyes too deep to be described - too light to be navy; too dark to be considered blue, they rest with flecks of illuminant jade and dove. -Click-, and the boot rests down(Dagger safely tucked within its cuff), and the denim swathed figure has made himself present again in the night. From years of confinement to purest freedom, the Adonis has returned. Beware. <BR>
