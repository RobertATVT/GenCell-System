</B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

<B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>                <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

It being such and odd thing no one ever acknowledged that it was done , or recieved.There was a certain pendant that her grandmother had given her when she was around six years old. It was very old, made of purple quartz.it was oblong in shape and slender, it was hung  on a silver chain. This was what she used to control her energys, to focus them. That is what her granmother had told her to do, that it would help her to use to discover the hidden powers within her mind.        <BR>
        Her father a  canadian mountie and mother a trial judge she was destined to become a lawyer.         Although all her life she has loved music and played every instrument she could get her hands on.        <BR>
        In college she studied long and hard her music was there to relax her.        <BR>
        One day during one of her stress playing sessions in the music room a passerby stopped to listen.        <BR>
        The intensity in which she played intrigued him and he asked her if she played professioanlly.        <BR>
        That was the begingin of her tour of the states.        <BR>
        She played every concert and hall she could get into.        <BR>
        One such concert brought her into voletta she was passing through on her was to New Orleans.        <BR>
        Then her car broke down,luck had it that a college friend she knew was living there and she looked her up (who just happened to be Alysse Hunter.)        <BR>
