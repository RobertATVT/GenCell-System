<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#300000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#300000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	The year was 1456 when I was born into the village of Dolgellau, Wales. January 9th, to be exact, having been conceived during the Beltane rites. Yes, the old customs were still very much alive in our little town - some proudly displayed, others, such as religion, more secretly practiced. The times were troubled for any not held firmly in the grip of Christian dogma. But we remained strongly tied to our beliefs. My mother was often heard to remark that I was truly a child of the Goddess, the proof of her claim being my fair looks, sharp wit, and above all my voice. "Not the Sirens themselves could sing more sweetly than our little Edana," one old woman remarked as I passed, humming an ancient melody. I think I was only four at the time. Young, but not too young for that little blasphemy to take root, growing into an almost all consuming pride. Looking back, I think that one phrase may have spelled the beginning of my end.<BR>
	I had an easy childhood. There were few chores that took up more than a morning's worth of my time, and so my afternoons were free to be filled with playful pursuits... not that I often spent them that way. In my free time I could usually be found practicing, holed up at home or seeking the solitude of the surrounding countryside, seeking no audience as I sang and sang. I was also known to pester the elders to teach me new songs, particularly those composed in ages long past and handed down from generation to generation. And all had to pity the traveling bard, for I would be stuck to him like glue, begging to be taught any and every instrument he knew. Often when the people of my village gathered in the evenings, with the secretive bulk of Cader Idris looming in the background, I would take my turn with the other storytellers and musicians to perform.<BR>
	If music was my physical passion, then my spiritual one was of course religion. As ravenously as I soaked up all things musical did I devour the more arcane knowledge offered to me. When I came of age I was made full priestess, and I proudly wore the blue crescent moon that had been tattooed with woad between and just above my breasts. <BR>
	Looking back, life was better than most people could hope for. Simple, maybe a bit primitive even, but I truly loved my little Dolgellau... for a time anyway. But as my twentieth year neared I began growing restless, as young people are wont to do. Rarely did anyone move away from Dolgellau, and when they did they rarely came back. But occasionally travelers would seek shelter with us for a time, and share their tales of the world. It wasn't long before my mind was made up... the odd story here and there wasn't enough. I wanted to see these great and sometimes fantastical sounding cities for myself. I wanted to witness firsthand foreign people and customs, and above all I yearned to sing in at lest one of the formal theaters that could hold audiences numbered in the hundreds. My mother was hesitant, of course, not willing to send her only daughter into a world so much more complicated and alien than ours without an argument. But in the end my lust for life and knowledge won out, and I left Wales with at least her blessing, if not her approval.<BR>
	Across the mainland of Europe I ranged.. France, Germany, Austria, Italy. And finally three years later I found myself in the city that had given birth to an empire... Rome. Up until then I had gone on a whim, performing for whatever money I needed and then moving on when the mood struck me. My personality was such that friends were not hard to come by, and lovers even more easily found. But the teeming city of Rome proved to be a much more difficult place to find my niche. Strangers were as common as locals, so a country girl from Wales was of no great interest. The poor lines every street, congregating outside of the many churches seeking alms. And of course the great shadow of the Church hung heavily over puritan and sinner alike. I was overwhelmed, and had it not been for the stubborn streak that ran through me like a steel rod I might have turned tail and ran back to Venice or Florence, or any other place more welcoming to one such as myself. I should have done just that. But hindsight, as they say, is 20/20... so I stayed.<BR>
	By this time the purge now known as the Spanish Inquisition was in full swing. Fanatics across the continent sought to find a better seat in heaven by scouring the land of heretics and Satan worshippers - a title which was used to describe any pagan or suspicious old woman too wise for the church's liking. Foolishly, I paid little heed to these events. But such had always been my way, neither openly arguing or agreeing with the Christian doctrine. Had I been less naive I might have at least feigned sharing their faith... but again, that is all in hindsight. <BR>
	I eventually found regular work at one of the larger inns, which featured entertainers in its large common room. It wasn't the glamorous theater I had hoped for, but for a time I was content. It kept me fed and sheltered, and the patrons were usually more than appreciative of my talents. Some more so than others.<BR>
	I had never understood those Christian hens, keeping themselves celibate until they were married to a man who would most likely see them only as a keeper of house and producer of children. I took lovers when I chose, usually some gentleman from the audience who had been seduced by my voice. At first it was only on occasion that I would allow these "fans" into my bed. But as the rumor and fame of my talent spread my suitors grew in number, until it was a rare night that I would spend alone. <BR>
	As much as I never understood lust being a sin, neither did I understand pride being a sin. Yes, I let those men stoke the fires of my ego as well as my body, finding the first only slightly less pleasurable than the last. Oh, I suppose I tried to be discreet, but in that day and age it was easier said than done. Soon the words whispered about me turned ugly, stories of the harlot witch who used her musical spells to entrap the souls of single man and husband alike, dragging them gleefully down into her perverse hell. These rumors might have been shrugged off as just that had it not been for the fanatical wind of the Inquisition that blew across the populous. It was only a matter of time before the inevitable happened - I was formally denounced as a witch. The Church moved quickly, spurred on by the threat of such an evil creature living practically side by side with their revered Pope Sixtus IV. I was arrested that same night, drug naked from my bed that was being shared by a minor aristocrat. Wrapped in nothing but a blanket, I was taken to my doom.<BR>
	As was the custom, every inch of my flesh was searched for the devil's mark. Of course, the inquisitors had no trouble finding the crescent tattoo that showed plainly on a chest heaving with anger and ignominy. A confession was just as easily gained. Chin held high and eyes flashing I proudly claimed the title of witch. Through his shock one of my priestly captors asked, "Do you repent your sins? Will you place yourself at God's mercy and beg forgiveness?"<BR>
	This was the point where I might have saved myself. Perhaps if I had thrown myself at the Church's feet my life would have been spared.<BR>
	I spit in his face.<BR>
	In that instant my fate was sealed. I was condemned to burn on the following Sunday, five days hence.<BR>
	On the second night of my imprisonment, I was woken from my troubled sleep by the sound of voices outside the tiny cell in which I was kept, bound hand and foot. The guard's voice I already knew well, for his favorite pastime was to taunt me viciously. But the second... so soft that I could barely distinguish his actual words, but carrying a confident power that somehow soothed me even as it caused the hairs on the back of my neck to rise. "I have come to hear this woman's confession."<BR>
	I was beyond intrigued, even though I had yet to catch my first glimpse of the man. Of course, I wouldn't let him know that. "You may tell that vile slave to the Christ that he can save himself the trouble. I have nothing to confess, as my conscience is no doubt clearer than his."<BR>
	"Watch your tongue whore." The jailor's pitted face appeared in the door's barred window, twisted with righteous loathing. "Show the proper respect to a man of the cloth or I will personally flay the skin from your back. Although in truth, Father, I'm not sure why you're bothering. This heathen bitch refuses to speak with any priest." His visage disappeared again, and I heard the jangling of keys as he worked the lock, along with the voice of the strange clergyman.<BR>
	"I will speak with her all the same. Move out of earshot, please. As you know, any confession she does make must be kept confidential." The door now open, I could see the guard as he opened his mouth to argue. The priest, who was a good deal taller than the stout man, leaned down as if about to impart some secret. The guard's dull eyes widened dramatically before he turned to move down the hall with trembling steps. The tall stranger then entered my cell, finally giving me a clear look.<BR>
	Towering over my chained form was a man who at first glance seemed elderly. A shoulder length mane of silvery hair framed a face with sparse, narrow features. His skin was wan looking, as if he'd spent too many long hours hidden away from the sun's rays. But for all of this, he was handsome. He crouched until he was on my level where I sat on a floor strewn with filthy straw, his eyes immediately seeking mine. Those eyes! Orbs of such a perfect crystalline blue never seen before in nature or imagination. Silently he watched me, with so much hungry intent that it was all I could do to remember to breathe. In some tiny part of my mind that managed to remain coherent I realized that he was in truth not much older than me. My assumption that he was elderly merely came from his greyed hair and the quiet air of ageless wisdom that surrounded him. But none of this mattered really... nothing did except for the lovely feeling that I was falling into those exquisite pools of cerulean. Time stopped, so there's no way of telling how long it was before he finally broke the pregnant silence. <BR>
	"Little Edana." My name was scarcely more than a breath on his lips. "You have an ancient soul and a naive heart. Such a gorgeous contradiction."<BR>
	"Who are you?"<BR>
	He continued on as if my question had never been spoken. "It would be a shame to snuff out such beauty and talent as yours. I can save you." His lips, a lurid slash of color against pale skin, crept oh so slowly and deliciously upwards, as if he fully expected the coming diatribe that was about to escape my own mouth.<BR>
	And it did escape, although not with the force I wished for. The words were pushed from a contracted throat, over a tongue and lips so numb they might have belonged to someone else. "Yes, I am sure you could. But only if I forsake all that I am and all that I believe in, and bow before you and your God." My voice dropped to a ragged whisper, filled with the last of my conviction. "I would rather taste the flames of my pyre."<BR>
	The gentle smile never faltered. "Not all is as it seems, sweet child. I have no more love for Rome's God than you. This guise is merely to assure that I could speak to you." Long, tapered fingers reached to trace the line of my cheekbones, then my jaw. Utterly entranced, I could not have pulled away from his cool touch if I'd wanted to. "I have come to offer you life, a life more eternal than these simpering fools with their visions of heaven could ever imagine." Before I was able to question this mysterious offer he went on. "Yes, be assured that I can give you this. It is yours for the asking. But I must warn you, this gift carries a heavy price. And you must first die before you can live forever."<BR>
	"Why would you offer this to me?" In spite of all he had said, this was the only clear thought that would form in my stunned mind.<BR>
	"I have heard you, and seen you, shining like a diamond in that inn. A voice so pure that nightingales would weep to hear it, its melody an arrow that pierced my heart with its beauty. I would not have such beauty cast into the fires of a petty religion." Even closer he leaned, until I could inhale the spicy aroma that rose from his silvered locks. A look akin to desperation, seeming so out of place, surfaced on his face, and his silken baritone cracked slightly with the intensity of his plea. "Please, tell me you will accept."<BR>
	I did. I will never know why, the entire situation was laughably insane. Maybe he cast some spell over me, but suffice it to say that the whole of my being clamored in desire, preventing me from giving any answer save one, price or consequences be damned. "Yes."<BR>
	The look of relief on his features would have been comical in any other time and place. But at that moment, it spoke of salvation.. perhaps for both of us. His hand fell from my cheek to push back the long, bedraggled curls that obscured my neck. Crimson lips lowered as well, until their soft tiers were nestled against the flesh of my throat, just below the curve of my jaw. The back of my head was cradled in a strong hand. >>Do not be afraid<< Did I hear that? No, his mouth had not yet moved, there was no accompanying puff of breath. Sudden pain, my gasp of shock dying as quickly as it had formed as a slowly building pleasure took over. I hung limp in my chains, and would have fallen into a slump against the wall had it not been for his supporting arms. How to describe the sensations? The precise syncopation of two heartbeats, the way his lips tightened against my neck with each fresh pulse of scarlet delivered to him, the incredible pleasure that weakened me as much as the increasing blood loss? The once strong thumping of my heart slowed and quieted - I could hear it as easily as he. Just before I thought I could withstand no more, the point when I was certain my death was imminent, his taking of my essence stopped. With weary eyes already half focused on the Otherworld, I saw again that engaging smile as those long fangs in turn punctured his own tongue. Before the rush of crimson could spill past his lips he quickly bent to deliver a kiss laden with dark gifts. No mere lover's embrace could ever be its equal, that kiss with which we traded life... or was it death? With the passion of a hundred women I suckled him, tasting for the first time the sweet coppery flavor that would for eons tie me to the night.<BR>
	Finally, he withdrew. I think I must have whimpered with the loss, but even had I not been bound my already dying body didn't have the strength to hold him. I felt his fingertips lay once more against my forehead, and then he was gone, with these parting words. "Do not fear the pain to come, sweet child, for eternity is yours."<BR>
	He had already exited my cell, but as the still shocked looking guard returned to lock the door I called out with what little force I could. "Your name... please!" And although I would swear I did not hear it with my ears, he answered. >>Alisanos<<<BR>
	The following days can only be described as an agony. Even my Inquisitor captors could not have thought up more brutal tortures than those that were inflicted upon me by my own body. At best I would be silently delirious, my thoughts winging across past and future until one was indistinguishable from the other, thoughts set free to roam by the violent fevers that wracked my form. At worst, I would scream and flail, seeking freedom from the molten blades that I was sure were being thrust repeatedly through every single nerve. The priests congregated at all hours to gawk and whisper their theories on how my condition was brought on by the evil spirits I had no doubt invited to possess me. And then, on the eve of the second day of my death came sweet oblivion. No pain, no fever dreams, nothing.<BR>
	I think I might have been happy staying there in the darkness, but of course it was not to be. I was dragged back into the world of the living by rough hands that released my bonds, brusquely cleaned me and dressed me in a simple white tunic. All this was actually meaningless, though, as only one thing truly surfaced through the fog of half consciousness that clung stubbornly to me. Hunger. When the guards had woken me they had also woken the blood lust burning in my veins. This was no ordinary hunger - it was the overwhelming need of an addict, the driving force of a zealot, the unstoppable rush of a tidal wave. I was, of course, ill prepared to deal with it. When I snapped from my stupor it was instinct alone that formed my actions. Lulled into false security by my sluggishness, the two guards left to escort me to my execution were careless, only one of them taking slight hold of my arm... leaving me free to attack. Pivoting suddenly to face the one holding me, my teeth were at his throat before either of them could comprehend what was happening. The momentum of my assault carried us both into the wall of the narrow hallway, hard enough to drive the air from his lungs and further aid my cause. Oh, the glorious rush of metallic scarlet that spilled forth to run into my gaping mouth, spilling over my lips and down my chin. The remaining guard was unable to pull me from my feast by himself, but his frantic cries for help soon brought reinforcements. And so it was that instead of facing my doom with dignity and under my own power, I was drug out before the massive crowd with arms bound behind me, still growling like a feral cat from the rich blood scent that covered me.<BR>
	What a spectacle I must have made. Wild eyed, wild haired, a wide swath of still wet crimson coating my chin and falling to stain the pure white of the tunic. It was enough to momentarily silence the assemblage of morbid onlookers ... but not for long. Nothing made them happier than an execution filled with drama.<BR>
	Most of this was lost on me, however, the instant I stepped out into the sunlight. The golden rays that once had warmed me like a lover's caress were now my enemy as surely as the actual fires that would soon lick my flesh. The brutal light seared my eyes until I could keep them open no longer for fear that they would melt clean from my head. Even with them closed, the dazzling glow filled the space behind tightly squinting lids, frying my thoughts until I would have fallen senseless if not for my captors holding me on either side. I could feel my skin begin to blister and crack as the binding of my arms was shifted from behind my back to being pulled taut above my head, tied to the post that thrust up from the pile of kindling. The screams of "Witch!", "Whore!", and "Harlot!" blended insensibly with the proclamation being made by one of the priests, the Archbishop I think. I could smell acrid smoke rising from the torches held ready to plunge into the kindling surrounding my feet. And when they did, the heat of the flames rising to devour me merged with and intensified that of the cruel sun. Sweat soaked strands of my hair began shriveling in the blaze, then catching fully until I truly wore a mane of fire. The cheers of the crowd were no more than a dull smear of noise in my ears as I drew in one last wretched, burning breath to let out a scream. Then, for the second time in as many days, darkness claimed me.<BR>
	How long did I float in that all encompassing blackness? I never really knew, but judging by the season I guessed that close to half a year had passed. When I once again awoke, the first sight to greet me was the face of Alisanos hovering over mine, his well chiseled features drawn and careworn. Although I asked many times, he never would tell me how he saved my charred form, I only know that it was indeed he that did save me and watched over me those long months. And it was he who told me what I was, and how to be a vampire. He taught me to hunt, to lure my prey away from those that would betray me, and how to feed without killing the victim. All these teachings I soaked up as I did all knowledge, but I added a special touch all my own. Harlot, was I? Witch? Very well, if those were the names that had led me to death and shadowy life, then I would use those very means for my revenge. If it was a whore they wanted, a whore they would get. With whispered promises and sultry looks, I would ensnare those I chose to feed from in carnality, using their hidden desires as a fisherman would use a hook.<BR>
	Alisanos and I traveled together for the better part of a century before he left me to my own devices. It broke my heart to see him go, but I knew that it was time. I haven't seen him since.<BR>
	From then on I wandered aimlessly from country to country, continent to continent. I would generally seek out smaller towns that reminded me of my own Dolgellau. But as the wild places of the Earth were slowly taken over by 'progress', and the modern world caught up with me, I finally ventured to America. It was by accident that I came across Voletta, really, just another hidden town discovered in my nocturnal journeys. I like it though... small, quaint, and eccentric enough that I should be able to blend in without a problem. Maybe I'll stay awhile....<BR>
