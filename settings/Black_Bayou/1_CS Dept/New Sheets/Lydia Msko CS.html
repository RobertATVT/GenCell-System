 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively. <BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> The vampire has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the vampire to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the vampire is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the vampire must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.<BR>

 <B>Generation cost:</B> 5 / <B>Experience Cost:</B> 25<BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. <BR>

 <B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>     Lydia stands about 5'3", and has a slim, neatly muscled form, light-boned and weighing perhaps 95 pounds. She appears to be no older than twenty-two. Her movements are always very precise, graceful in an athletic way. She is half English and half Japanese, but it is the Japanese features that dominate her appearance, just as the upper-crust English accent dominates her speech. Her skin is a pale cappuccino color, smooth and unblemished, stretched over the clear outlines of muscle and bone. Her hair is black and thick, naturally straight and tumbles down around her shoulders. Her face is sweet and rather narrowly oval-shaped, large, almond-shaped eyes dominating her visage. The eyes are as ebon as her hair, veiled with long, thick lashes. The bridge of her nose is almost completely flat between her eyes- a straight, pert little nose recalling her Caucasian heritage. Prominent, sloping cheekbones and slightly hollowed cheeks meet with pouty lips that are curved more often than not in a knowing smirk.<BR>
   <BR>
   For the most part, she is casually dressed- either in fitted black jeans or faded, ragged blue ones. Steel-toed combat boots with laces of varied colors, solid colors of shirts, usually sleeveless and often with a high, butterfly collar. Her carriage, however, is enough to suggest that she may as well be wearing a Versace gown rather than faded jeans.<BR>

             Lydia was born 1 November 1953, the youngest of four children, growing up in the sumptuous wealth of York as the daughter of a wealthy investment banker and a successful feminist and non-fiction writer. She was a bright child, very intelligent and showing artistic promise early, and received the best education money could buy. The last two years of college were tumultuous for her- she started shooting heroin, and got involved in an "escort" service to pay for her drug habit. She had a pregnancy her senior year in college, and had a premature heroin baby that she gave up, who died shortly after birth, to her knowledge.  After graduating from Cambridge in 1973 with a degree in finance, she moved to London to take an apprenticeship with a well-known painter and sculptor of that time. She broke all contact with her family at this time, having already descended into heroin addiction, and didn't last long at her apprenticeship.<BR>
               She lived two years in London, becoming just another squatting punk heroin addict, desperately addicted, turning to prostitution and small crime to support herself after she became homeless. Eventually she met a vampire named Damian Nolan, a son of Vlad Dracul, who turned her roughly to his way of eternal life. She traveled extensively with him, putting aside her art for some time. It was the late 1980's when she reappeared on the art scene, honing her skills with the masters of Paris and Rome before trying to break into the art world. She had some minor success in Europe, and obtained the services of the famed agent Thierry Laud.<BR>
               Lydia had been living in Paris for two years, quite satisfied with her life there. Recently her agent suggested a trip to some small town in America, where another of his clients was opening a gallery. Lydia hardly had to ask to know it was Severine Aristide, a woman fairly worshipped by Thierry, but whom she had never met except through her art- neoclassicist work that Lydia does not find terribly exciting. Lydia arrived in Voletta with Laud on 11 September, only to discover that Severine Aristide had been killed in a fire at her gallery the night previous. Laud being the executor of Severine's estate, he granted it to Lydia, convincing her to open the gallery herself and work out of it. The large amounts of money possessed by Severine, plus the lure of having her own gallery, were enough to convince Lydia to stay in Voletta for the time being. <BR>
               To date, Lydia has completely remodeled the once-fire-gutted second floor of the Gallery Licorne Noir, a large, two-story Tudor-style building on the edge of Voletta. A studio / residence has been created on the second floor. She was married to Remy Thorne on 11/16/96. Her current residence is Evangeline's Oak, as she inherited the Evangeline's Oak estate upon Alina Chapaev's death. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
