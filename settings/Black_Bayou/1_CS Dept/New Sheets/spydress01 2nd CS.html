</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

His has nice muscle definition but tends to not get to the gym that often due to his lazyness. His short brown hair and deep blue eyes seem to get him in good with the ladies. He usualy wears a black trench coat with black pants and a white button down shirt. He will often wear suits if he is trying to impress someone. HE ALWAYS CARRIES HIS KNIFE IN A CONCELED LEG HALSTER!!!<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></I></U>Christopher Dupuae was born on June 27, 1978.  He was raised in an orphanage in Paris where he was beaten when he was incolent, which was very often. He learned to speak english there because of his dreams of finding a better life in America. He knew that his dream would never be accomplished in an opphanage so ,at the age of 8, he set fire to a lavatory and while the owners of the orphanage were puting out the fire he ran away. He lived on the streets for 5 years and often posed as a street preformer. He survived by sleeping under doorways, stealing scraps of meat,   One day a European Circus came to Paris and one of the Acrobats saw Chris preform. He went to the owner and had him come see the talented 13 year old. The owner liked what he saw and hired chris on the spot. In the circus Christopher started as a Clown but a martial arts expert , who preformed mock battles and feats of strenth, took a liking to the now 14 year old. Su Lin by name taught him the art of Chi. She also taught him how to use a fighting knife. Su Lin acted like a mother to Christopher.  By age 19 Christopher had learned a lot from his master and she had little left to teach him.  Su Lin's death was and accadent. She was preforming a bullet dodgeing preformance and was shot in the chest mortaly wounding her. Before she died she gave Christopher a Knife with the head of a dragon for a handle. He learned how to use the knife and devoted his life to fighting and teaching others how to fight, Just like Su lin. A month after Su Lin died Chris left the circus, bought a plane ticket and flew to America. To earn money he acted in the streets never staying in one place too long. He has lived in america for 1 and a half years and he is relocating to start fighting. His first choise was New Orleans because of the modified french language but then decided, because of the extensive poliece force, to pick a different place in Louesana. He chose Voletta due to the high crime rate, Cops will be occupied with murder victims not street fighters. <BR>
