System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Dakota was born on a ranch to Mr. and Mrs. West. Her mother died a few months after she was born and left her father to raise her on the ranch he owned. She waws raised with a brother 6 years older and sister 5 years older. Her sister was madly jealous of the girl as soon as she was 13. The young girl was fully mature and shapely by her 13th birthday. Sandy, her sister, was mature but her younger sister still recived the affections of the guys around. Dakota, seeing how much her sister despised her, started working harder and helping around the ranch more. Her sister soon started college and was sent away for school. With one less worker Dakota's father needed a new ranch hand. The new help, Josh, was her  brother Art's age. Josh and Art soon became friends. Durning the summer Sandy came home. Finding a new guy around she quickly moved to earn his attention while Dakota worked harder doing some of Josh's and Sandy's work plus her own. While everyone assumed that Josh and Sandy would marry, Josh merely put up with Sandy while watching Dakota. The day Sandy left again for school she wept and Josh quickly saw his chance with Dakota. While everyone was saying good bye he took her to the barn and told how he felt. Dakota was overwhelmed that he could feel that way about her and was soon fooling around with him in the barn. Art went looking for them to tell them that Sandy was leaving. He came across them in the hay and grabbed Dakota throwing her off of the man and took his knife stabbing the man out of anger. She quickly was dressed and Art took her out to their father telling him everything. Always being the unfavored one she quickly packed her things with tears and left during the night without telling anyone or saying another word to them and gathering all the money she had, quite an impressive amount. Going to the bus station she got a ticket to the cheapest place that would take her. With her forehead pressed to the window of the greyhound she read the sign that marked the enterance of her new home "Isle Voletta".</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
