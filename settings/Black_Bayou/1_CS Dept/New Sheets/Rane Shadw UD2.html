And someone we've trusted when they stood in front of us, pouring drinks as we made scandalous deals with dark figures.  What do they know?

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bat Form</B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
   System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
   Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
   <BR>
   <B>Healing</B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
   System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
   Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A>.)<BR>

   System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
   Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

   System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
   Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

   </I>System/Duration:<I>  </B></I>NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<B><I><BR>
   </I>Effect/Description:<I> </B></I> When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire can not feed in this form, since it <B><I>must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between family members, vampires have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The vampire can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance.  Each family member must have the mastery Call The Family to be included in the Mindspeak.  The family must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.<BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>The head of a vampire family has a great amount of control over those brought into the fold.  The originator of the blood that both killed and resurrected them acts as a link to their master.  The family head can reach out and compel one of their blood to return to them, even over great distances.  This form of beckoning will cause the affected vampire to do whatever they can to join their master, even at great risk to their own unlife.  The called vampire will immediately cease all activity and and travel with great haste to their master's side.  Once they have been affected, there is no way to escape the call.  In addition, this mastery enables the family head to sense whenever one of their children sire a new vampire.  This knowledge is gained instantly at the moment of creation.  The siring vampire must email the family head immediately informing them or they may risk OOC penalties.  The bond is not fool proof, however.  Should the victim not be online, then they are immune to the mastery.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Effect/Description: </B>At times, a show of power is required to persuade a reluctant child into obedience.  Being the master of the bloodline, the family head has great control over the life force presiding within their children.  With sheer force of will, the family head can speed up the atoms within the blood of the victim, causing it to heat up.  Within seconds, the blood will begin to boil causing unbearable agony and damage within the victim.  Those struck with this mastery immediately suffer 4 points of damage to both Body and Mind.  Additionally, due to the lingering pain and discomfort, all die rolls for the remainder of the scene made by the child are halved.  The victim must be within line of sight for a family head to inflict their wrath upon them.  Wrath may not be used more than once on the same individual per night.<BR>

System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 24 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>Among having mastered the blood that is their line, some family heads have also mastered the darkness with which they live.  With but a thought, the family head can mold its very substance to that of shadow.  They will appear translucent as their skin takes a shade of pitch black.  Their facial and other distinguishing features vanish as their bodies become two dimensional.  The family head can shrink and enlarge itself at will.  While in a shadowy form, the vampire is unable to affect any physical object or person.  Likewise, they are unaffected by any form of physical attack or contact.  Mental masteries, sunlight and holy water will continue to affect the shadowy vampire, however.  Another benefit of this mastery is the ability to meld with the shadows around them.  A family head can literally become one with a shadow and travel along it from end to end, completely undetected.  If the shadows of two objects cross, they are able to move from one shadow to the next.  The family head must be in shadow form to travel in this manner.  While traveling across shadows, the family head is completely undetectable, unless they choose to be visible.  A bright light, such as that of a flashlight, that hits the family head will pull them from their shadow form immediately returning them to their normal physical state.<BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; Instant.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>With a moment of concentration, and prior to the Elder falling unconscious, the family head with this mastery will cause the membranes and tissue of their own heart to strengthen tenfold, nearly taking on the consistency of stone.  This makes the family head nearly impossible to stake.  If all the requirements of a Lore 3 staking attempt is made, you must also roll 2d6+Body+Athletics vs victim's 2d6+Body+Athletics (the Body is the victims particular max, not what they currently hold). This roll is a physical attempt to pound the steak through the toughened membranes of the Elder's heart.  Only one attempt can be made to break through.  If the attacker win the roll, the Elder dies.  If the attacker looses the roll, it triggers an unconscious Mass Mindspeak that is transmitted automatically to all of the Elders children normally reachable by such means.  This version of Mindspeak not only pinpoints the Elders current location, but it also works for family members who aren't even online, so Email is okay.  (The scene will not be paused for the Elder to return Email or answer other IMs - this is for an emergency 'send' only)  There are several other benefits to this mastery besides the hardening of the heart.  All long range staking attempts will automatically fail.  The Elder will receive 2 points of free Body loss per round with no effect.  All other damage taken after this 2 Body will effect the Elder normally for the remainder of the round.  This remains in effect for the entire scene once activated.  On the downside, Elders receive -4 to their Quickness due to the toughening of their skin and if the elder doesn't make their TN to activate this mastery, they will be stunned for one round due to shock on their heart and are unable to attempt it again for 5 rounds after that. <BR>

  	Tristan Rane was born in the small town of Crossroads,  New Mexico  His father was very abusive to him and his mother and they finally divorced when he was 12,  and he became the man of the house.  Trying to make it through school,  he was always a loner and was constantly fighting.  Because of his small stature,  he worked out to make sure he could take care of himself.   Barely graduating from high school,  he took a job in a local country club to try and support his mother. Eventually he took over  bartending and made good money in tips. He supported his mother for a while, and she became dependent upon him.  As a bartender he was very friendly with the ladies,  and took a shine to one particular red head named Sonya Lockheart.  She allowed herself to be courted by him,  and they became inseparatable.  His mother,  seeing him devote all his free time to his new love,  became worried that she would lose his support.  She tried to tell him that his Love was a tramp, and that she would only hurt him,  but only susceeded in putting space between them.  Thinking tht she would "save" him,  she seduced the mayor of Crossroads and convinced him to do something about Sonya.  The mayor readily agreed.<BR>
         The next night,  Sonya was up at the country club with Rane,  as usual,  when the mayor and some of his friends came in.  They drank half the night . .watching Rane and Sonya all the while.  They drank till they had courage enough to do something.  Letting the liquor drive them,  the sheriff and his men surrounded Sonya while Rane was busy and took her outside.  In the parking lot they had their way with her.  Rane,  not knowing what was happening, eventually searched for her and found them in the parking lot.  He let loose his rage upon them,  knowing that in their drunken state they would not stand much of a chance.  One of the men pulled a gun, and the Mayor grappled for it.  The gun went off,  and when the smoke cleared Sonya lay in a pool as red as her hair.  She died there, and Rane lost it.  He seized the gun and shot every last one of them,  saving the mayor for last.  Before he shot him,  the mayor told him that it was his own mother that had asked them to do it.  in his grief he went home and killed her too.  <BR>
          With the regret of what he did, he found himself on the run from the law.  A bounty was placed on his head because of the mayor's murder,  and he was always found wherever he went.  Out of time,  out of money, and out of strength,  he took the advice of a fortune teller and made his way to Isle Voletta, where he was told he would find his fate. <BR>
