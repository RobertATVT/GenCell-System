   System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
   Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
   System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
   Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)<BR>

   System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
   Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

   System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
   Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

   <B></I>Generation Cost:</B> 5 / <B>Experience cost:</B> 25<I><BR>
   <B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.   They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>
   	<I>Personal wolf form:  light gray (silver); small in size compared to most wolves, yet larger than the average sized collie</I><BR>

   <B><I>Obsession</B></I> <B>- 1 Soul to use.  (::Obsess:: <victim/nature of obsession>)</B><BR>
   <B>Generation Cost:</B> 10 /<B> Experience Points:</B> 50<BR>
   <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes.<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  By making eye contact or touching the victim, the Vampire can stoke the fires of their soul, provoking an intense obsession within them.  Whether the obsession is a person, place, thing, emotion, etc. the victim will feel strongly compelled to do whatever they can to obtain the object of the obsession.<BR>
      <BR>
   <B><I>Shadow Manipulation</B></I> <B>- 1 Soul to use.  (##ShadowManip##)</B><BR>
   <B>Generation cost:</B> 5 / <B>Experience Cost:</B> 25<BR>
   <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks.  They may not be seen, but they may be smelled or heard.  Casting light directly at the vampire will destroy its shadows. <BR>
   <BR>
   <B><I>Confidence </I>- 1 Soul to use.  (##Confidence##)</B><BR>
   <B>Generation Cost: </B>5<B> </B>/<B> Experience Cost: </B>25<BR>
   <B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 turn to activate.<BR>
   <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Vampire is a confident creature in most situations, almost to the point of arrogance.  This confidence, when firmly believed in can strengthen the Will of the vampire, granting it a bonus of +4 Will.  This confidence is removed the moment the Vampire fails to avoid an attack or mastery for the rest of the night, or fails any other dice roll, as its confidence is now shaken.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Not a sound is heard to announce the approach of the lone figure, cloaked in shadows, stepping slowly closer along a cobblestone path bordered by tall, hovering trees and elegantly kept rose bushes.  The whisper of a cool midnight breeze passes through the trees, disturbed leaves rustling slightly, the shadows fleeing from the figure as if the wind had chased them away.  Now the woman can be seen in all her glory as she pauses, the pale moonlight filtering through the foliage above to bathe her in its radiance.  Adorned in a long flowing gown of the sleekest navy satin, she stands proud and stunningly beautiful, all the grace and sophistication of her native France spoken in every movement.  A defined ivory complected hand rises to pull the silver, intricately designed clip from her hair, releasing the long silken locks to tumble down her back in a waterfall of pure gold.  Piercing depths of shattered sapphire that sparkle with tiny flecks of darker blue and white survey her surroundings from underneath a thick veil of lashes.  A tilt of her head is given to glance at a nearby rosebush, a smirk washing across features delicately chiseled into smooth ivory flesh, curving twin crimson hued rose petals as she moves to pluck the white, silken flora from its slumber.  Her gaze rests intently upon it as she raises slender digits to brush over the petals in a gentle caress, her other hand delicately holding the stem of the flower, caution taken in avoiding the random thorns.  Her attention taken from the rose as quickly as it came, she releases it to fall upon the walkway.  A heeled sandal plagues it with its shadow before crushing it, robbing it mercilessly of its beauty as she proceeds, grace defining strides taking her on her way.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>It was October 31, 1971.  The rain pounded down onto the black streets of Versailles as Stefan Arcana rushed into the hospital doors.  He ran into the room and Helana Venéfica smiled at him through her pain.  Tonight was the night.  It was Samhain, one of the witches' Sabbats, and the night her baby was to be born.  <BR>
   	July 21, 1977:  Alissa stared up into her mother's eyes.  She was five years old, but her mind was that of an adult.  She could see the secrets and the deceit in Helana's eyes.  What was in that twisted mind?  Alissa didn't know if she wanted to find out.  She turned her eyes back to her Advanced German book.  She had almost mastered the language, just like she had mastered Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and English before that.  Her intelligence was exceptional, and she understood many things.  Her mother was afraid of her.  Afraid that she would uncover her secrets.  Alissa didn't yet know what those secrets were, but she knew that Helana had many.  <BR>
   	Stefan walked into the room of their mansion in Munich.  He had never married Helana.  Alissa knew that it was because Helana didn't want him to.  Helana also insisted that Alissa keep the name, Venéfica, though she never said why.  Also, they never stayed in one place for long.  They were always moving, running.  Helana was afraid that if they stayed somewhere too long, people would get suspicious.  Suspicious of what? Alissa wondered.  Suspicious of what?  Stefan walked briskly past them.  A chill went through Alissa's body.  That always happened when she was close to her parents.  She could also feel the power that emanated from her parents, strange and evil power.  Alissa often wondered what gave her parents this air of invincibility.<BR>
   	September 17, 1981:  Alissa stood, looking out the window of their house in Milan.  She watched as her father, Stefan Arcana, drove away.  He was on his way to Venice for five days.  Alissa didn't know that he was never to return.  She turned around to face her mother.  "It's time," Helana said with an evil smile.  Time for what? Alissa wondered.  She would find out soon enough.<BR>
   	September 18, 1981:  Early on that cold September morn, Alissa walked past her mother's room.  The door was open.  It was never opened.  She knew that Helana would be gone for most of the day.  She always was.  Alissa walked into the room.  Immediately, the temperature dropped five degrees.  She had goose bumps on her arms, so she went over to the dresser, picked up the folded blanket, and draped it over her shoulders.  She turned to look at the bed.  A book lay open on it.  An old, dusty book with faded pages falling out.  Alissa picked the book up and sat down on the creaky, wooden floor.  The book was written in Latin, but Alissa read it easily.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

If you quit now and do not complete the seventh stage, you will meet the cruel fate of your partner.  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Alissa was shaking uncontrollably.  Could her mother really be planning to do this?  She got up and made sure the room looked exactly as it had when she came in.  She ran up to her room and closed the door, dreadfully awaiting her mother's return.  <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>   	That evening, Alissa heard the front door slam shut.  Helana was home.  She walked up the stairs and went directly to her room on the second floor.  Alissa opened her door and heard the click of the lock on Helana's bedroom door.  She crept down the stairs and put her ear to the door.  She jumped back in horror for inside her mother was chanting the awful chant in Latin.  This can't be happening!  Her mother can't do this!  Alissa ran up to her room and to a night full of nightmares, which weren't ended until the next morning.<BR>
   	Alissa was awakened by the knock at the front door.  She heard her mother scream and burst into uncontrollable sobs.  She had been given the news of Stefan's death.  It was only after the messenger left that the laughter began.  The hideous laughter that pierced Alissa's heart and turned her blood cold.  She would never be the same again.  From then on, Alissa was full of hatred and loathing of the world.<BR>
   	Helana went into her room still laughing.  Afraid of what would happen if she stayed, Alissa went downstairs and out the door, never again to return.  She hated her mother and knew that in three days she would be dead.  She would die the death of her father.<BR>
   	Hiding in trains and boats, two days later, Alissa arrived in Greece.  That night she wandered through the dark alleys anxiously awaiting the third sunrise.  As the sun peaked over the horizon, Alissa fainted.  She saw a vision of Helana searching the streets somewhere in Europe, frantically looking for Alissa.  Suddenly Helana clutched her heart and fell to her knees, crying out, <I>"Malo Dominus, Anguibus Custos, Aufero!"</I>  In English this means: Lord of Evil, Keeper of Snakes, take me away!  Then Alissa became conscious and knew that she had just watched her mother die.  Relief flooded over her, but it did not wash away the hate.  The hate was a permanent stain.<BR>
   	Over the years she lived on the streets, barely living.  She even sold her body for just enough money to eat and clothe herself.  She became numb to the pain and she didn't care about anything anymore.  She often cursed God and hoped that she could have the power that her parents had, their invincibility.  That's when she started hearing stories.  Strange stories of a little town in Louisiana.  The town, Isle Voletta, she heard was home to people with power.  Power like her parents had.  Strange, supernatural power.  The power she'd been searching for.  So she made her way to that strange, little town in Louisiana.  Could this be it?  Could this be the turning point in her life?  She had to find out.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
