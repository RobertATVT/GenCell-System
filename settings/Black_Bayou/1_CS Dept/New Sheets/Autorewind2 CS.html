System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer-4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> </I>- 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> </I>- 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B></I> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

Generation Cost: 5 / Experience cost: 25<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
Effect/Description: When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>Shadow Manipulation</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B></I> - 1 Soul to use.  (##ShadowManip##)<BR>
Generation cost: 5 / Experience Cost: 25<BR>
System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will Vs, TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description: A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight,' including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard.  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>  Background: Born in the Los Angeles Area Hospital and was raised in the same city.  My parents weren't the ideal parents of the world. They were thieves, liars and all around crooks.  My dad (Mafia syndicate) used his connections, or the ones he said he had, at all time.  My mother was not even a legal citizen in the US and wouldn't step outside.  She was actually from Canada and spoke little English.  My father knew French but never used it. But I loves them and can forgive them.  Growing up was tough, I was in and out of public/private schools frequently.  I went through high school without friends because I was to shy to make any having never been in the same school long enough to.  Wanting to break this chain I left my family at 18 and changed my name from Aaron Quaine to Aaron Ceriss. I went into the Air Force immediately hoping to find something I was good at there. It turned out I was good, but not the best.  I could build and fly them but when they closed the base due to funding they discharged me.  I then came to Voletta remembering that my sister disappeared in this area.  So I came to live here hoping to find her.  But it turned out they had found her dead in a creek somewhere the day before my trip.  Deciding to come here anyway I got on the plane.  Then I ended up here.  Searching the streets I found a small place in the west of the city.<B><BR>
