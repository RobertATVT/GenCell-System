<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

 Breed:  Mortal (Human)<BR>
 Age and/or birth date: 30yrs  11/10/69<BR>

 Hair: Raven Black<BR>
 Height/weight:  5' 7"  110lbs<BR>

 Appearance (clothes, etc.):  Because of her heritage, Jessica is often seen in Native American clothing (mostly on special occasions).  However, when lounging around or just being casual, she's in the normal t-shirt and jeans.  Of course, for business, she's always in her tasteful conservative suits.<BR>
<BR>
As far as appearance goes, no one is going to mistake her for anything other than Native American.  What tribe she is from is a different story.  Her 'straight as a board' jet-black hair used to reach to her waist in her youth, but age now finds it hanging just to the beginning of her shoulder blades.  Eyes of warm brown are normally seen with a matching smile.  All of this is made even more striking by her yellow-brown skin, and perhaps she could have been a model, if she had more energy.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Background:  Born in Jacksonville, FL, Jessica Weilds lived a regular middle-class life.  Her parents, Melissa and Joeseph Weilds, were both employees of a small life insurance firm.  Times were never rough, nor were they extremely prosperous.  She was never a cheerleader, but her school life was still avarage.<BR>
<BR>
She went to college at Georgia Southern University and studied to become a CPA.  While there she met John Hill, and as often does she fell in love.  They were married when she was only 20 years old.  In the beginning, it was a wonderfull relationship, but by the second year, things had started falling apart.  John had become progressively abusive, to the point of one night putting her in the hospital.  They were divorced a short time later.<BR>
<BR>
It was a nasty proceeding, and left with nothing, Jessica fled to Isle Voletta.  There she met a few friends, and learned of a completely different life; the life of the pack.  A curious individual, John BlackCloud, promised to one day make her a part of his pack.  She was, of course, enthralled by the idea.  She started putting the pieces back together with the help of her friends Javin Winter, Rya Winter, and of course mother Syn.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly before the act was supposed to take place, another tragic event occured.  Her brother Ricky had died in a drunk driving accident.  Crushed, Jess left to heal yet another wound.<BR>
<BR>
Afraid to return to Voletta so soon, Jess went back to college and got her other degree.  But something gnawed at her soul.  After staying with a rather large firm in Savannah, GA for only three months, she quit and made the long trek back to Voletta.<BR>
