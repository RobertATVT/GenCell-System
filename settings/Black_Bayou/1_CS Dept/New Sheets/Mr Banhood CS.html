 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Empathy</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Empathy <target>##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mind Shield</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##MindShield##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> Piercing glacial pools of arctic composure peer from behind the duo of atrametrous, reflective lenses; the hues cut of finely polished lapis flickering with an icy intensity capable of sending a chill through even the most valiant of souls. The flawed complexion of well-embellish ivory adorned solely by the shallow bundle of ebony hair which remains suffused around the contours of his mouth and chin, thin peach lips holding an aura of staidness in their posture upon the far from perfect countenance. Burlesque limbs of the six foot six figure clad of loosely woven denim carry their proprietor about with an uneasy stride, the boots crafted of resplendant leather material creating faint clicks against the pavement with every heavy footfall. Vociferous, perhaps over-developed muscle pulsates and bulges from beneath stalwart skin, the tightly-woven muscles of his abdomen and chest obscured slightly by any one of a myriad of tops and short sleeved shirts.<BR>

 During my child hood I was less than protected due to my parents no really caring about me nor what I did, eventually I was attracted by the sheer power of guns. Over the years I have grown attached to guns and a special friend named Lamar King. I joined a gang called the East side vipers against my friend and lover Lamar's advice. Over the years I have stock piled a lot weaponry. Then I was captured for the crime of murdering the chief of police. Looking to make an example of me they attempted to put me through rehabilitation. After many years of community service I began to realize how lucky I was to have been given a second chance and how wrong my past actions were. After being set loose on bail I retired with my family to a cabin deep in the Adirondack Mountains. Here my passion for weapons extended into the range of rifles and shotguns, I once again began to stock pile weaponry but this time only for the use of good. When I decided to return to the city, It was to my surprise that I had inadvertently prevented the assassination of the New York Senator by. Apparently someone had planted a bomb in his limousine and while giving his speech for reelection I decided to take a look at the car. It was a nice car, little did I know that my touch would set off the 12 pounds of C4 the limo contained. Hurt but not to serious extent, The Senator was overly grateful and decided to wipe some of the bad from my "permanent" record. I then discovered that Lamar had departed for a place in the deep south known as Isle Voletta. Eager to reunite with my friend I headed south to the place known as Isle Voletta. Perhaps there I can start a new life in some kind of law enforcement.<BR>
