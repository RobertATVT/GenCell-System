<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 Appearance(clothes, etc..):  </B>Leroy was once a common street gangster in the early 1920's.  As a result of this, Leroy tended to wear ratty old pants held up by aging suspenders, a battered white t-shirt, ratty old boots and a knit cap.  After he demonized, the darkness of the powers that be granted him his darkest desire: To have money and power.  After he was made a CEO, he began wearing Armani suits and nice Gucci shoes.  However, his head remained shaven bald and his neck remained with a lone tattoo of a dragon on it.  In addition, his limo driver always wears Leroy's ratty old knit cap as a constant reminder of his roots.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Skidrow, 1924:  The ratty and run down district of Brooklyn run by small time teenage mobsters.  Each one with their own leader.  The one that distinguished himself to the point of respect and admiration by his fellow mobster.  The pecking order was such that one could not advance without the higher ups letting you do so.  There were the bosses, the lieutenants, the kingpins, the footsoldiers and, of course, the constantly jostled and beat up: Independents.  Leroy was one of those independents.  He survived on his lone wolf business of selling crowbars in front of dumpsters.  Of course, this was not to say that Leroy came up with this idea all on his own.. Oh no.. Leroy made a living off stealing or copying the ideas of others.  His first business venture happened to be selling cats to dog trainers.  This was profitable until one of the dogs mistook him for a cat.  How even and unintelligent animal like a pit bull could mistake a 245 pound Italian/American for a small domestic cat elludes most people, even to this day.  <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>	Regardless, Leroy was constantly pushed around by his peers.  His perceived low-intelligents combined with his hair pin business schemes made him an easy targets for taunting and the occasional beating or clubbing.  More than obviously, Leroy or Roy Boy Idiot, as some now came to call him, hated this foul treatment.  More than anything he wished for power.  Power over these common thugs, power over the bosses and power over his own life.  He considered himself pathetic.  A 25 year old man letting a bunch of common teenage thugs push him around.  <BR>
	"I sell my damned soul if they'd god [ ] respect me.  Or betta yet.  If they worshipped me." he muttered to himself.  That night, he climbed into a bed exhausted.  He had suffered three beatings today alone and had only been able to seel 5 crowbars all day.  3 of those crowbars being used to beat him down.  That night, he had a dream, well, more of a vision actually.  <BR>
	"Hey man, yo gotta dolla?  I'll sell ya a crowba for a dolla."  he gave his sales pitch to a tall and finely dressed man as he glided past.  The man turned, his bright and vibrant green eyes scanning Leroy over.  The man produced a dollar, seemingly out of thin air and handed it to Leroy.  Leroy smiled and giggled, as he so often did after making a sale, reaching into the bag beside him he pulled out a bright, silver crowbar and handed it to the man.<BR>
	"Aight, coo, here yo crowba." he said powerfully.  The man smiled casually and introduced himself as Rancor.  Leroy couldn't help but chuckle at the name. <BR>
	"Leroy DeRoy.. Correct?"  Rancor gave a cool nod of the head as he said this, his green eyes continually scanning the man over.  <BR>
	Leroy frowned before speaking, "Who da hell is yo.  Some cop?" <BR>
Rancor shook his head, one arm reaching out to touch the man while the other stayed at his side in a near defensive posture.  <BR>
	"Leroy, you want power do you not?" <BR>
	"Hell ya I wan' powa.  I'd do anyting ta have dose lil' brats bow down ta me."<BR>
	"What would you do to obtain this power, Leroy?"  <BR>
	"Anyting.  I'd scour the earf for a friggin' dime if yo asked to."<BR>
	"Such is a good attitude to have, Leroy."  	<B><BR>
	</B>"You offerin' me powa or somethin'?"<BR>
	"Actually, Leroy, yes.  I offer you endless power.  Beyond even your wildest dreams.  And all I need, is one simple thing.  One simple thing for endless power.  Endless money.  Endless respect."<BR>
	"Just tell me what the [ ] yo want from me mo [ ]!" <BR>
	"Just sign this contract, Leroy.  With your blood and all of it can be yours."<BR>
	Rancor produced a piece of paper which Leroy hastily grabbed and, without reading, signed. <BR>
<BR>
	<B>Isle Voletta, 1999<BR>
</B>	Leroy stood with a casual smile on his face.  The expanse of his "Scientific Research Foundation" easily viewable from his Penthouse.  The various experiements and weapons testing he used his facility for boardered alchemy in their nature.  Yes, Leroy had come a long way.  A year ago, he was brought to the Isle by the Demon Lord himself, Memnoch Berovichi.  The man had set him up here.  Given him what he needed to start this massive reasearch foundation.  Although in his mind, he was the only important Demon on the Isle, he did know that there were in fact other Demons on the Isle.  What they wanted and how they functioned was none of his concern so long as they did not move against himself or Memnoch.  Should that occur, Leroy had made sure the offenders would pay dearly. <BR>
	<I>You've come so far Leroy.  Are you not glad you made the investment of your soul?<BR>
</I>Leroy smiled cooly.  One hand smoothed over the bald surface of his head as he spoke.<BR>
	"You're damned righ' I'm happy, Mo [ ]."<BR>
He turned, his presence here was still a secret to all but Memnoch.  Leroy's developed ruthless nature made him feared by those who had taunted him so long ago.  And althought they had all suffered and died at his hand, he remembered each name, each face, each plee for mercy and each horrified face,  It was time that the denizens of Voletta knew Leroy was there.  Oh yes, Leroy had plans to impact the citizens of Voletta.  Clever plans.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
