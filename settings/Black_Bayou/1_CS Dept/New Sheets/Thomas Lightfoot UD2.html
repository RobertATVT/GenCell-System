 <B>Effect/Description:</B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Times New Roman" LANG="0">Thomas Wolf Lightfoot was born on June 6, 1973, on the Hopi reservation located in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The only son of Joseph and Lilly Lightfoot.  The Dad left home at the age of five, to run off with some floozy he had met during his drinking binges.  The note he left said that he needed a change of pace and to start off fresh.  They were left to get by whatever his Mom was able to make while working at the local diner.  And to make things even more pleasant at home, she had a different boyfriend every week.  And she dated all kinds, as long as they had a wallet and a heartbeat she was there.  A few of the men she brought home were civil to Thomas, but the majority didn't give a rat's ass about him.  The drunks were the worse since they usually took their frustration out on him.<BR>
 <BR>
 The only person that did look after Thomas was his grandfather, John Mourningwind, from his mother's side.  He had taken him under his wing a year after his Dad left them.  He ended up becoming the "father" figure that he desperately needed.  He would spent days upon days listening to him tell stories about the old days and what makes the Hopi who they are.  His grandfather also taught Thomas was those before taught him, the ways of becoming a Shaman.  Now even though Thomas did below average in school, it did not show his true inner self by any means.  He was quite the brilliant person, when there was something that had his complete attention.  And the only things that had his attention growing up was boxing and his Shaman lessons.<BR>
 <BR>
 He didn't pick up the gloves until his Freshman year in high school, but they seem to never come off during those four years.  He even had small aspirations of making a career out of it, but it ended up going nowhere, since he had a hard time determining what weight level to fight as.  During high school is where he met his friend Trey Ravenheart. and became good friends.  Most of his high schools years were just skating by and getting into the occasional rumbles with a group of White men that would come over to the Reservation to pick fights.<BR>
 <BR>
 His grandfather was quite pleased at Thomas' progress in learning the Shaman way, but was always worried about him trying to do too much since he was very eager.  Two years after high school, his grandfather passed away in his sleep.  Thomas took this very hard since he had grown close to him all those years.  He was then left on his own to continue his progress and he was always trying things that were above his powers but he usually succeeded.  <BR>
 <BR>
 Then there was one fatal night late in 1997.  Thomas & Trey were out having a good time when they had a run in with the same old group of men.  However this night the men were drinking and sorely outnumbered the two buds.  At the end of the conflict, Thomas was left beaten within inches of his life and Trey fared even worse, he died.  Thomas was not ready to let his friend go yet and decided to use his powers to the max and attempt at finding Trey's spirit and place it back in his body.  Now Thomas was not even close to trying this but without the supervision of his grandfather, he had no one to stop him.<BR>
 <BR>
 At first Thomas thought he succeeded in it when his body came back to life and trey was before him again.  Needless to say Thomas was a bit in shock when Trey left the reservation a couple of weeks later, but during the brief time he spent with him Thomas started to get the feeling that this was not his high school friend.  That was when he started to doubt his abilities to control his powers and stopped practicing.  Over the next year or so, he tried to push things back into his past and forget everything. <BR>
 <BR>
 That was until Trey return to the Hopi Reservation.  Thomas ran into him again, since he was right but now curious as to whose soul resides in his old friend's body.  This new <I>Trey</I> had a different mode about how things should be.  And this fact was obvious to Thomas, and that is what the main reason was for Thomas following him to Voletta, to find out who Trey was now and if necessary correct the problem.<BR>
