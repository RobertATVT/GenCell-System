<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<I>April 5th, 1987. !0:30 PM<BR>
</I>	<I>"Thea! Get down here!" Daddy Ulric's voice carried up the steps to her shared bed room. Thea, only eight at the time tosses a sorrowful look to her older sister Dee. Saying, without words, 'I don't want to go.' Dee shook her head. The older of the two girls, when Daddy got violent Dee could usual manage to set in and take the brunt of his attacks. She was stronger then Thea. And she loved her little sister enough to do it.<BR>
	Tom, a name synonymous with traitor loomed in the door way. "Daddy's callin' for yah Thea. You better not disappoint." A vicious smile curled the boys lips. He was the oldest of the children, 16 by now. He was also completely on Daddy's side in all things. Brother, was not a fond words in Thea's vocabulary. <BR>
	She looked again helplessly to Dee. The older girl shook her head. This was one pain she couldn't take away from her sister. Tom ducked in and grabbed his youngest sister firmly by the arm. Hard enough to bruise. Yanking her forward he pushed her against the door way. Looming over her as that serpentine grin curled his lips. "Come on Thea... He's not gonna hurt you.... Does he ever hurt you?" Running a meaty paw through her hair, he leaned in and pressed his lips to her forehead. Hand sliding down to linger by her hip, cupping it. He hovered there a little too long before pulling back and yanking her downstairs. Dee could be heard throwing up again in the bathroom.<BR>
	Thea held a special place in the men in her family's heart. Heart and bed.<BR>
<BR>
</I>	When their mother died giving birth to Thea, the youngest daughter, the Ulric's pulled together in a very special way. Their father split things along a very even line. Tom got the love. Dee got the violence. Thea.... Thea got the.... Attention. But those we're family matters and for the most part they kept them inside the walls of their home. Dee was tomb boy anyway, so an extra bruise here or there hardly mattered to teachers who watched Dee push herself farther and harder then all the other children. Tom was a bully, but bullies happened so that too went unnoticed. Thea was a quiet, no silent child. It was simply her nature, or so the schools assumed. No one tried to get near her to discover how terrifying that nearness might be for her.<BR>
	Years passed and the family kept things quiet. Tom grew meaner. Dee angrier. Thea more withdrawn.<BR>
<BR>
<I>December 19th, 1997 2:45 AM<BR>
	Thea, by now, was the only one still living at home. Tom was full grown and Dee was away at school. It wouldn't be long she told herself. She was one acceptance letter away from a full scholarship to a really nice liberal arts collage up north. She'd get out. Away from Daddy and his sweaty palms. Idly a hand lifted her cheek. The dark purple bruise forming there would be hard to explain. Without Dee there any longer.... Well... She'd be out soon. She'd get out and away from him. She wouldn't linger on the threats he'd made. Wouldn't think too hard that he'd been cleaning his guns all day. She had finals to study for. He couldn't shoot her. He was her father. <BR>
	A sound. A rattling at her window. She blinked and went over. Unlatching it to open it wide. She blinked and took a step back a Dee's eyes peered at her through the darkness. There was something... Wild.. In them. Something untamed and Thea had to swallow hard not to yelp. <BR>
	"Help me get in Thea." Her older sisters voice crept in through the window in a hurried whisper. When they we're young and Dee had dates Thea would help her sneak in and out this way. It was a painful reminder of a time she was at least a little safer. She didn't say anything though and simply helped Dee back in. Her sister always had been taller. Much taller, but now, somehow.... She just felt towered over.<BR>
	"He hit you." She hissed grabbing Thea's chin and turning it to look to her cheek. Her hand was so cold it sent a shiver down Thea's spine. Thea didn't need to answer, so she didn't.<BR>
	"What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at your dorm or something?" It wasn't that she wasn't glad to see Dee. It was simply her arriving like this surely couldn't be a good sign.<BR>
	"I had to come. Look. Tom's coming to visit pop late in the morning. I don't want you to be here. I'm going downstairs to meet them. Thea... Your in a lot of danger." The wild eyes flickered over Thea and she fought hard not to shutter. <BR>
	"I don't understand."<BR>
	"Dad went through a lot when I left for school.. Thea he isn't going to give you up. You look too much like Mom now." Dad had been saying things like that for a while now. 'you look so much like your mother. So lovely like your mother.' The thought of it ran her blood cold.<BR>
	"He's going to try something... That's why he's been cleaning his guns." It was logical. It would have made sense she been so calm about it, if it hadn't been her life they we're talking about.<BR>
	Dee shook her head and pulled her younger sister in for a quick hard hug. "Goddess," Goddess? That was odd. "Thea... Don't tell me you've given up already. There's more of a fighter in you then this. I know there is." She didn't notice it right away. But later when she mused on the moment, Dee wasn't breathing.<BR>
	Thea sighed. "I'm not a fighter Dee. I'm a scholar. You can't be.."<BR>
	Her sisters hand rose and pressed to her lips. "Not true. Not true at all. We've got a few hours, come sit. I'll explain."<BR>
<BR>
</I>	That morning Dee would explain it all. That the fairy tale about demons and monsters were real. All of it true. That a little body no longer meant you we're weak. That the spirit of the Wolf could free her. Thea bought it. Hook line and sinker. A way out she'd never even imagined. Then Dee told her. She'd been bitten at collage. She had the power now to take their revenge on Daddy. That Daddy wasn't any more mortal then Dee. That he'd signs a contract with the Devil. That he wasn't human. That it was Dee's duty to take care of it before he spread his evil to their brother. That Daddy would never hurt them again.<BR>
	A week later the papers would report that Steven and Thomas Ulric had been attacked and killed in the woods outside their house having apparently stumped into a satanic cult doing some kind of rital. It was a bitter sweet thing to read the article. Apparently the reality was Daddy had taken Tom out into the woods to sign him over to Demons. Dee left that week with her half of the families money. Saying someday she'd return to her sister and give her the Gift. Take her over to the world of Night. Thea wasn't so sure if that was best for her,but kept that to herself. <BR>
	Three weeks from that Dee was killed by hunters on campus. Thea retained all her sisters half of the family's money.<BR>
	Thea bore all of this silently. Bore everything silently. She spent the next two years getting a Bachelors in Female Studies and Anthropology. Minoring in Urban Legend and Folk tails. That is to say, studied everything she could on the nature of the Undead and the Dark spawn. She needed to know what had invaded the silence in her famiy. What had upset the order of things. Not hardly useful for anything but further study, perhaps contact someday, but she still had money to fall back on, and still had a hunt to follow. The Wolf waited. To carry on where her sister could not. To be stronger. That's when she heard about Violetta...<B><BR>
