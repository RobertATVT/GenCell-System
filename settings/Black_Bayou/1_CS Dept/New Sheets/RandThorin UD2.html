</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  <B>Adrenaline</B> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Luck</B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
  <BR>
  <B>The Gift</B> - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

1)<I>Empathy </I>-1 Soul   (##Empathy <target>##)<BR>
System/Duration:</B> 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some mortals have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<B> <BR>
2)<I>Heightened Awareness - </I>1 Soul (##Aware##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> 2d6+Will vs. TN 22; Scene; takes one round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>   Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc)<BR>
<B>3)<I>Phenom</I> - 1 Soul   (##Phenom <skill>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B> see below / Scene; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Every once and awhile, someone comes along who is so exceptionally gifted at something that their ability far exceeds anyone else's.  This mastery allows the player to temporarily add +3 to the skill that was selected for their Gift.  The player must roll 2d6 + the stat of the skill being increased.  The target number for the roll is 16.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill makes the character a Phenom.  This skill may only be used once per night.<B><BR>
4<I>)Leap Of Faith</I> - 2 Soul to use. (##LeapOfFaith##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human soul is known to manifest itself during desperate times of need.  During times of intense fear or when faith is the only thing they have left, mortals tend to reach deep down into places they didn't even know existed and harnessing this energy from everything that makes them mortal.  As a result, the player may add +8 to the next Faith roll their character makes (only applies when a the Faith skill is used).  This mastery may only be used once per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   	Rand Thorin began life as just your average American male. Born into a middle income family in Los Angeles, he was an only child. He attended school and graduated in the upper divisions of his class, then went on to the University of California at Los Angeles to study towards a history major. Rand spent many years working hard, trying to achieve the best life he could.<BR>
     	It was after all this running around that Rand grew tired of it all. He longed for some way to get away, but the means to do so eluded him.<BR>
     	Rand graduated college and found dull job in retail. Shortly after his twenty-third birthday, however, he got his break. A rich uncle suddenly died of a massive heart attack. Though the event caused much grief for Rand, because he truly had loved that uncle, it was also through this death that he inherited a small fortune of half a million dollars, chiefly due to the fact that the uncle had held Rand just as dear.<BR>
     	Possessing $500,000, it was tempting to splurge it. Rand, however, sought professional help, and within a few years had invested most of it in  farm land and apartments/housing. Through money paid to him as rental and leases, as well as percentages of the crops grown on his land, he was able to maintain an income that allowed a comfortable lifestyle. And of course, as time went on, that level of comfort rose.<BR>
     	With his relatively new income and freedom, Rand traveled across the nation, searching for an interesting place to make his home in. While such places as Colorado, Texas, and Oregon intrigued him, he just didn't feel that they were "the place."<BR>
     	Finally, his travels brought him to Voletta. Rand surveyed the area and the inhabitants, and knew instantly that this would be an exciting place for him to spend the remainder of his life. <BR>
   	He had a home built not far from downtown, and concentrated on living the life offered by this strange city. He's met many strange people, some of the chief players in his life being Ms Syn Blaidd, Special Agent Andy Trask, and Ms. Lydia Thorne.<BR>
     <BR>
     	He has had two great lost loves. The first was a high school girlfriend named Amanda. They were together for two years; however, just before graduation, she and some of her friends celebrated a little too much and subsequently rolled their car, killing everyone inside. <BR>
     	It was only in his fourth and final year of college that Rand met his next romantic interest. Her name was Carrie and they met in a history class and soon began seeing each other outside the academic life. No accident or injury claimed her, but after a few months the relationship broke down, and she began seeing another man.<BR>
   	Shortly after moving to Isle Voletta, however, he met his third love interest. Bryn Monroe, daughter of a wealthy Georgian banker. Though they had their ups and down in the relationship, they were finally married on February 14, 1998. <BR>
     <BR>
     	Rand has four other passions in life. He is an avid book collector, searching high and low for novels, histories, and informational texts. In his house he spends most of his time in the library, a massive room with floor to ceiling shelves to hold the collection he has accumulated through the years.<BR>
     	Classic cars are another great interest. Though he drives a 4x4 Chevrolet around Voletta for practical purposes, he does own a 1969 AMC Javelin and a '69 Chevy Camaro. He loves all his cars and delights in keeping them in top form to show off to friends.<BR>
     	The third reason for Rand's continued life is a desire to explore the unknown- this is the driving force behind coming to and staying in Voletta. He knows that there is much that is strange in this area, and this catches his interest. In fact, he's made a special interest of learing about the "nightlife" in the bayou, and is somewhat of a scholar on all the creatures and beings running lose in the swamps.<BR>
     	The final thing Rand is attached to is his cat Amber. He practically worships this cat, seeing to its every needs and spoiling it rotten. The surest way to rile Rand would be to insult or injure his cat.<BR>
