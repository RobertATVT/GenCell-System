 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Animal Mimicry</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use. (##red fox##)<BR>
 System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
 animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
 System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
 System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

 System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 System/Duration:</B>  NA / Scene; takes 0 rounds to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the lamia is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the lamia attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>Effect/description:  </B>Through the use of this spell, the lamia can electrically charge an item to deliver a shock upon touch.  This spell causes the static electricity in the air around the item to spark when another object comes into contact with it.  This spark causes -1 Body damage to anyone who touches the item.  This can be cast on weapons, causing knives to do 2 damage, for instance.  Due to their explosive natures, bullets and shells cannot be charged.  The item must be touched when the charging is cast.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the lamia to flawlessly detect the true nature of a target.  The lamia will instantly know what the individual's breed is.  The individual must IM the lamia with the truth if the lamia wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the demon.  Lamia must possess Lore Level 2 for the breed they are attempting to detect, in order to recognize it for what it is.  If the lore is not possessed, the lamia will only know there is something odd about the target.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  <BR>
  Well I grew up in Baton Rouge living a typical surburban life until I was about 10 or so. When i was 10 we had gone to the beach one night. My parents sent me off to play but I couldn't help being curious about what they were doing so I watched in some nearby bushes. They were performing some sort of pagan ritual but at that time I had been taught by my friends that witchcraft was evil, that they were worshiping the devil. I got out of my house and lived with my friend for about 5 years until I researched my growing interest in this devil worship. I found out that it wasn't true and moved back into my parents home. Until I graduated I studied the fundamentals of witchcraft. <BR>
  <BR>
  When I turned 18 my parents gave me a book of spells and customs and sent me to Isle Voletta. I got a job at the Lunar Bluez Cafe as a performer, I read my poems to an audience. Soon after I moved into Zoe's apartments and took on a job as a waitress there.  I later moved in with a close friend that also works at the cafe. My life was pretty good, but it got better when a publisher read some of my poems I had been sending out. He said that I had a chance to get my poems published, but I had to go to Baton Rouge to get the deal worked out.<BR>
  <BR>
  While I was in Baton Rouge I got about 5 poems published in a collection book, and I was paid handsomely for it. But one night, when I was walking back to my hotel a mugger attacked me so fast I didn't have time to do anything about it. They say I was unconcious for about a week and my wallet was gone. Thank god I didn't have amnesia though....or so I thought. Everything was fine for a while untill I tried doing some simple spells. I couldn't do them, I knew about them..could say the words and everything but it just wouldn't happen. When they released me I came straight back to Voletta to get some help from my friends..."<BR>
