System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

On Jan. 15, 1975 in Billings, Montana; Thomas and Sally Munro celebrated the birth of their first son, Jakob Dylan.  His birth was soon followed by a set of fraternal twins, Jessie and Jamie, and then finishing off the family was the youngest, Teresea.  Thomas Munro supported his family by working on the ranch his Dad had left him, keeping busy all hours of the day while Sally stayed at home and took care of the four children.  Once Jakob was old enough, he spent any free time helping out his Dad with various tasks.  Then in the Summer of 1987, tragedy struck the Munro household.  Over the course of a couple of weeks, Sally was violently ill, her body never able to recover, passing away in her sleep.  With the family in turmoil, Jakob took it upon himself to keep them together.  He took care of his sisters and brother, letting his Dad to focus his energy on work.<BR>
<BR>
As the years passed, Jakob began to yearn for freedom from the confines of his life.  He found a temporary solution when he signed up for a photographry class in high school.  His eyes were opened to a whole new world.  Jakob began to turn his attention away from the ranch he was destined to inherit and focus on his new passion, photography.  Over the next three years in high school, he perfected his craft through working on the newspaper, yearbook and various other projects.  So much so, when it came to graduation, Jakob was offered a scholarship to attend University of Chicago so he could continue his excellence and receive a degree in Photographry.<BR>
<BR>
That is when he met her, Lexi Crenshaw, while he was interning at one of her father's magazines.  Even though they came from different backgrounds, the chemistry was evident from day one.  She was different from other girls he had met in high school and his first couple years in college.  Jakob was glad to see she had felt the same way about him when their relationship continued after his internship ended.<BR>
<BR>
During the Thanksgiving Holidays, Lexi was due to fly to Montana to meet Jakob's family for the first time.  As she was packing the night before, she began feeling dizzy and hot, and she collapsed before she could finish the first suitcase---the victim of a rare form of viral meningitis which ravaged her body and left her immune system severly weakened, her brain slightly damaged, and her hearing non-existent.<BR>
<BR>
Jakob flew to her side immediately and remained with her and her family throughout the winter.  His presence and encouragement nursed her from the brink of severe depression and steadied her through the transition of learning a whole new language and way to communicate--sign language.  Her parents were thankful for the inspiration he was to their daughter,  rewarding him with a generous position with one of the magazines to keep him close to Lexi.  The extra bonus was that Jakob outperformed the father's expectations and became a major asset to his firm.<BR>
<BR>
Through out her comeback attempt, Jakob stood behind her, supporting her a 120%.  His own heart brokes with hers when the day of her retirement came, but he was determine to help Lexi through it and stay by her side. Now, almost 2 years after her retirement, her father has decided to try to wean Lexi from her tremendous reliance on Jakob by giving him assignments and responsibilities that require travel.  The assignments started off small and infrequent but have become more regular with time.  The often carried him to other parts of the country, even a couple times out of the US.<BR>
<BR>
Usually circumstance has prevented Lexi from joining Jakob.  Mother has suddenly needed her at home, or she has been asked to make an appearance for various health and medical organizations.  But Lexi had never been to Louisiana before--had never even heard of Isle Voletta, so when Father asked Jakob to help oversee a small, southern magazine he was bailing out of trouble by buying it out and resurrecting it, Lexi couldn't help but tagalong, much to her Daddy's chargrin.<BR>
