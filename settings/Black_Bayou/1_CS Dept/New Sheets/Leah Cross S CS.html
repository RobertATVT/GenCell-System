</B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your axe is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>   Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>She's smaller than you'd think. Dirty blonde hair has been cropped short; hardly long enough to pull back; just brushing the curve of her chin - sharpish, giving her heart-shaped face a 'pixie' quality. Cheekbones are pronounced - even on a wiry 5'1" frame, ninety pounds isn't a lot - making the dusky blue eyes appear even larger than they are; small ears and a longish nose stick out a bit extra given the gauntness. Her figure is something just barely hinted at. Spindly bones extend limbs to delicately worked feet and hands; long toes and fingers taper off neatly. A much-paled tan rests over her, blurring color. The rosebud lips are softer than the rest of her, paralleling the facets of her eyes - though mouth and windows harden as well, to stubborn lines; her moodiness is reflected perfectly in her expression.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Lee Cross was born August 23, 1978, the second daughter of a couple in Baton Rouge. On first acquaintance, Lee is the sweetest kid -- polite, charming, ready to smile and chat about music or books or physics; anything at all to keep the conversation going. She is, however, a person of absolutes; sometimes harsh in her judgment, and basically moral -- except with herself. Here she can be said to be destructive, and masochistic; these things in such a way that exposes an intense fragility, if you look hard enough. <BR>
<BR>
Her parents divorced when she was fifteen (grounds of abuse). She was hardly ever in trouble at school -- however, when she was, it was bad. She didn't get along with her boyfriend well, but they stuck together as a sort of abusive support system; they'd beat each other up (mostly verbally) and hang around for hugs afterwards. Not to mention the fact that drug connections are important. During high school, she also picked up the nickname 'Starling'. This might best be explained through personality conflicts and quick retorts; in the way she's territorial and inviting at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
After graduating high school, they moved to New Orleans together, and took the cheapest apartment they could find. Neither one had money for rent, let alone college. What they did have went to fuel various addictions. Of course, they eventually lost the apartment... For a while, they took to squatting in an abandoned warehouse, but split up within six months of that, after a particularly bad fight during which fists flew and knives appeared. Intermittently, Lee left and came back - ran into someone in London and became a little more than your regular pickpocket; she stole religious artifacts for this man (Lorenzo Maguey). This last time, however, Lee came further south, towards Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
