<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B></I>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

She might prefer bare feet, but has found a (very beat-up) pair of Doc's most useful; colored on them, patternless, and decorated them with beads and chains, by feel. She is small-statured and delicately boned; a fair complexion porcelained with time, and a mouth like a Boticelli cherub's (penned dark). She can't look more than seventeen or eighteen.<B><BR>

 Background:<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>In 1632, a little girl crept through a Roman church late one night and got lost. Demons and angels; souls can transport themselves.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>
 </B>	She was a nun, once-upon-a-time, in Rome, by the time she was eighteen. She remained in the convent for just over a year; by the time World War II had ended, she had left; turned prophetess, blinded by her own doing. Rape, it was whispered, stole her spot in the church; or worse, she had lost a baby. Worse still: she had killed it as it came squalling into the world, innocent (its mother's crime). Rumours. Whatever it was that had gone on, she kept to herself and to God, twisting reality to make a character; the epitome of Greek Seers; a modern-day Tiresias of Oedipus - A suicide attempt gone wrong; the Methanol only succeeded in damaging her retinas and leaving her terminally queasy. <BR>
	It wasn't until June in 1948 that it happened; and she, little Anais, had been wandering between Rome and Jerusalem peddling her insights for gospel; whispering poetry in the ears of the prostitutes and monks who took her in; trembling fingers over the keys of a piano whenever anyone allowed her the opportunity. She played for Christ, she said later. He might have been, too; she took communion from his wrist and murmured a prayer more blasphemous than not in response to the feel of his smile. Her Christ was maybe not such a Christ; maybe so - whether he was or not, he gave her some mere semblance of sight (like a red camera, she will tell you if asked; things that move and things that don't) and some weird immortality in the newly declared state of Israel; Jerusalem, the immortal city itself - a place called holy and wandered by many, homeless, prayer-seeking. Someone ought to grant the voiceless prayers, she thought once. She would have.<BR>
	Intoxicating; a liquor dream, even after he left her (somewhere between St. Petersburg and Ontario); she switched accents often, until there was no trace of the old Italian left, and discovered that, after all the experimentation with string and wind, she loved the piano best. There were few definites back then: she wanted to learn to play the 'cello; wanted to learn to write (properly, without so many dashes); wanted to know what love was like. She was naive. She discovered love and all of its adverse affects in Ontario, and toyed with orchestrals in a flat in New York. He came back twice: once to teach her (everything about love) what it was; once to reprimand this wayward little angel, kicking her halo - rusted as ever - along the pavement. The last time, it was she who left: third time's the charm. This was 1986; a lifetime's worth of music with fewer and fewer boundaries later. Littler sight; the peculiar incarnadine images, those in motion and those with breath; a discerning tinge. That's all. He gave her this, though; the ability to see her hand on the piano keys, to see her foot on pavement - a comfort, more than anything, that. To see your foot on the ground is something more splendid than most ever pass credit to. <BR>
	They say that when angels cry, they cry blood. God's blood, maybe, as angels aren't made of the same stuff the humans are. They say, too, that the angels cried for her one day, and it rained blood on the east coast of Ireland for that one moment. But she will snap back: there is no great tragedy encased, here. There is no reason to grant that excess of sympathy you seem so eager to give. They cried the day she denounced all of it, breaking her own heart, and went to sleep.<BR>
	She's here looking for heaven.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
