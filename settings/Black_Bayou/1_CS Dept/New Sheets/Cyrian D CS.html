           System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
           Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

           System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
           Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

           System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
           Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

           System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
           Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
           <BR>
           </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

                        March 7, 1987<BR>
                                He landed face down on the ground again as the older boys pushed him towards the hill.  "Get up there little <TOS> or do we have to kick your <TOS> again to get you moving."  The thirteen year old boy raised his head off the ground, putting a hand to the blood coming slowly out of his nose and looking up to the speaker.  The speaker, the leader of the small group of high school freshmen, didn't look any worse for Cyrian's attempt to resist his bullying. Cyrian knew what the bully wanted him to do, towards his feet from his position on the ground was a trail that lead up higher on the hills of the valley.  The path lead to a group of houses secluded, almost isolated, from the rest of society. "What's the matter, don't want to visit the chinks?"  Cyr's thoughts were once again interupted by the bully's foot as it caught him on the chin.  The large foot of the 15 year old, pissed off because of getting second choice field goal kicker instead of first, sent Cyrian all the way over backwords so he could see the trail instead of the bully.  Blood quickly started to run from the red mark left just below the cleft of Cyrian's chin as tears left hot trails down the sides of his face.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>There was strong feelings of apathy for foreigners in this area, and the extended Chinese family livnig on the hill was the most obvious group of foreigners around.  So to the bullies, forcing the young, weak Cyrian up there was a torture, the anti-foreign feelings were already buried deep within them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> Another boy stepped out from the group watching, poking Cyrian with a stick he used to walk on. "I think you hurt him."  Pushing Cyrian's head to the side and leaving a dirt smudge on his cheek.  "Maybe we should leave?" The bully turned on the other boy. "Nah, he's going up there."  Reaching down and dragging the tearing child to his feet.  "Now get moving squirt."  Pushing young Cyrian towards the trail. Little pinpoints of light swam from the edge of his vision towards the center as he stumbled towards the trail.  Not having much other choice with the children behind him laughing.<BR>

                   He stumbled further up the trail, if he hadn't been hit as hard he might have realised he could've just left the trail and headed back towards town.  But instead he kept going up the trail.  All anyone had ever heard about this cluster of houses was that a group of chinese descended people lived here.  They had the modern convenieces like everyone else, electricity and stuff, But they lived with some old traditions and were rather introspective. Holding one hand to his bleeding chin he looked more down then up as the first house came into view.  They were not expecting visitors that day, especially not coming up the back trail from town. So when Michiko, watching her younger brothers as they played out back, saw the boy coming up the trail she at first stood watching him in a state of shock, before calling out for her father a Chunin of the clan.  Seeing the beaten and bruised condition of the boy the father and daughter took him inside, cleaning him up.  With all that had been said about these people young Cyrian was afraid at first, but with the kindness they were showing him his fears were eventually alleaviated some. But before long after they had cleaned him up and given him a drink the ineviatable question arrived.  "Why is it that you walked up to our home on the back path, or more likely stumbled in your condition?"  With some coaxing the man and his 17 year old daughter finally got young Cyrian to tell them the story, of how the bully and his friends beat him till he left.  He finished of with saying he wasn't sure why he came all the way up, but yet here he was. While the boy talked the Chunin, a man in his early forties, coolly appraised Cyrian.  Looking at the Boy's I-Ching, examining the boy's potential. For a few minutes after the boy was finished he kept examining him.  <BR>

                   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Finally the man spoke, his voice slightly acsented from his upbringing in China, though his daughter and sons were American born. "You could fight back child, even though your smaller then them." Speaking quietly remembering his futile attempts Cyrian answered, "I tried sir, I couldn't do anything to him, he's too much..." The Chunin cut him off. "I do not mean with your body child."  Meeting the childs uncomprehending stare. "I mean with your mind, " Touching a hand to the boys head. "and the unmatched power of a living soul."  moving the hand down to his chest over his heart. Michiko stepped up behind her father, her thin form leaning over her fathers still leaning over the boy to whisper in his ear.  "You do not mean to teach him our way do you father?"  Laying a hand lightly on her fathers back.  "You cannot, it is forbidden."  "It is forbidden to learn him our way Michiko."  The man turned slowly to his daughter,  "But we can spart his interest some, he has a strong will and it can be cultivated."  He stared his daughter straight in the eyes. "You will show him how.  How his intellegence can be used to help him like a weapon when it is used in cunjunction with the body, how to think, how to move within the harmony of changes of the I Ching.  And it would be good practice for you."  Turning to look at the boy.  <BR>
                            The calm facade came back to Michiko as she gave her father a respectful bow.  "Very well, I shall do as you say."  Turning to the boy who still sat in silence on a table, not sure what had just transpired.  "Come, your first lesson will take place immediately."  She said it casually but knew the boy was still weakened from his early experience.  This first lesson would be one of his most difficult.  Young Cyrian followed Michiko out the door, not asking any questions how this was going to change him.   <BR>

                   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Over the next few monthes Cyrian kept visiting Michiko and her clan for lessons.  Ignoring the tauntings of "Chink lover" from the other children at school.  Eventually Michiko and Cyrian's relationship changed from teacher and student, to friendship.  She taught him the basics of the clans style, knowledge known to some outside the clan in a simaliar fashion.  He learned to understand the I-Ching, to know when to strike by examining the aura of an opponent in the pakua tradition. Though some things Cyrian knew she avoided teaching him.  It was rumored that the clan had some strange practices, with good reason.  He knew Michiko wanted to teach him whatever was being held back, she was constantly giving young Cyrian praise for his aptitude and determination.  But she couldn't teach him, it was forbidden. A few monthes after his lessons started they were over, Michiko had taught him the basics, and though there was more he could be taught, nothing was, only review. When he was 18 and graduation was drawing near at high school he knew he would not be seeing Michiko much anymore if at all.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> He was going away to college, and knew he'd miss all the times he had played with her in the woods.

                   Present day:<BR>
                   Eighteen and out of college Cyrian heads out to Isle Voletta on intership.  It's not often to get one on your first year but Cyrian was a very good writter.  He checked into the Voletta Inn and went to seek out what would be his new place of work for a few monthes.<BR>
