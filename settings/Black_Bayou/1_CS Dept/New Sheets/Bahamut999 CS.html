 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
 Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  Nick Galian was born on November 18, 1976.  He grew up in England.  His parents were former Voletta residents that were originally from England.  They moved back to England and had a child.  Because it was only 3 pounds and 4 ounces in weight when born, the father did not feel it was right to pay the bill for a baby that wouldn't survive.  His mother went with his father back to Voletta but an adoption agency paid the bills to keep him alive.  He was put in several foster homes.  The one that he was put into when he was 5 was his real Aunt, but he didn't know that.  She had changed her identity so she could adopt him.  His life meant nothing until he turned 7.  He had found one of his few relatives by a tip from his foster mother(His Aunt, but he doesn't know that).  She was Emma Rose Campbell, his Aunt's daughter.  He was put in the same school as her.  He started playing soccer to fit in with the other boys at school, but his only friend seemed to be Emma.  They had all the same teachers and everything until they were around 14.  That is when they found word of their other relative from their Uncle.  By then he was considered a soccer prodigy, and Emma was an amazing cheerleader.  On their graduation night, they talked about there plan to go to Voletta and find their last real blood relative.  Nick went to police training for two years, then they left to go to Voletta.  As the plane landed, a bunch of creatures attacked it.  They were Vampires.  Emma escaped the plane and went off to live a regular life in Voletta, while Nick was forced to fake a vampiric conversion, to save her life.  He fears that it may not have actually been fake, but when he went to a doctor about it, he said that if nothing happened in the next month and a half, he'd be okay.  Nick nodded, made sure he protected Emma by staying away from her (just in case), and made a fake police badge.  He now acts as Fortea and Vampire hunter.  He also has engraved Emma on his sword, which he has trained with since he was 11, but was broken by a vamp.  This vamp keeps haunting him and his cousin.  Emma has a husband now in Voletta, and he is also being threatened by this vamp.  Nick hopes to bring an end to it.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
