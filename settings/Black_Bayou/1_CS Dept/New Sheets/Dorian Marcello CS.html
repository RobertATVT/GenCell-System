</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Wiry muscles trace long bones, creating thin lines to shape the whole beneath the stretch of golden olive skin. Wide emerald eyes look on the world with an innocence gone from his normal demeanor. High, molded cheekbones, combined with a beardless face and long lashes give a feminine cast to his features. Hair too dark to hold highlights molds softly around his face, curling just under a firm chin and at his neck. Long, almost delicate fingers spring from relatively small palms.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Late in the biting cold of a New York Christmas in 1980, a small boy approximately two or three was found hiding for warm in the dumpster outside of a police station. The almost delicate child could give no last name or home address. No reports of a missing child matched the boy who gave his name as 'Dory', either. Despite the best efforts of the state, his parents could not be located. The name Dorian was assigned to him as a best-guess on his original first name with the appellation Smith. The child ended up as so many others have, fallen between the cracks, and shipped from one foster home to another until he was seven.<BR>
<BR>
It was then Stephen Marcello decided the time was right to expand the family. The youngest son of a corporate entity, he had long since given up on marrying -- they only saw his money. But he did want a child. Someone to teach his favorite 'hobby' to, someone to sing with, someone to watch take flight -- as his father had done with him. Stephen's money -- for once not cursed -- and the family reputation led to the quick adoption of Dorian Smith - now Marcello.<BR>
<BR>
Stephen suffered from a well hidden set of delusions. He was obsessed with music and thieving. It was Stephen's obsession with music -- particularly the now mythical castrati -- drove him and the still delicately built boy eight year old into hours long lessons, leaving the private tutor for other days as often as not. It drove him to resurrect the castrati -- if only in one child. The Marcello fortune paid for the operation -- labeled a possible gang initiation attack on police records -- that protected Dorian's voice from the 'ravages' of puberty. The music lessons were pushed harder.<BR>
<BR>
At age fourteen, the 'hobby' lessons began. Excursions to various cities or seedier areas of New York. Burglary sat as well with the lean adolescent as had the intensive music lessons. A careful grace fell into place about his movements, concern over his differences from normal boys vanished. He was special under the eye of his father, Stephen Marcello. That is all he needed.<BR>
<BR>
Stephen retired from the field when diagnosed with too-far-gone cancer two years ago. He continued to monitor his adopted child's heists and musical practices until his death a year and a half later. For six months, Dorian Marcello was lost. His always available yet never pressing father would no longer be there to see him through. But Dorian had been raised to be strong.<BR>
<BR>
Six months later saw Dorian on the road to a shabby house in a backwater town. Somewhere new, somewhere to start on his own.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
