</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use. (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Wolf Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (##WolfForm##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Alexandra "Zand" Honor Dagenar is the younger sister of Sebastian Jareth "JD" Dagenar (SN: Bast Dagenar), and Nicholas Graham "Nix" Dagenar.  She is three years younger than JD, born March 13th, 1977.  She is feisty, domineering, strongwilled, and the only person that can shame JD into making an apology.  She is short, delicately built, with light brown hair and pale violet eyes.  She sometimes writes poetry, when the mood strikes her.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>The Dagenar family are native Australians. Parents Steven and Ann Dagenar were killed in a car wreck outside of Melbourne twelve/thirteen years ago. The children went to America, and they're only living relative, Matthew Dagenar. Matt had been naturalized through marriage, and was a Vampire hunter.  Zand was 7.<BR>
	Matthew taught JD in "the Trade", since Nicholas showed less interest than his father had in it. Relations are strained between Nix and Matt. He'd lost even the hint of Catholicism years ago, but he remained too conservative to tacitly accept Nix's sexual preferences or career choice. JD and Zand never cared - they're younger, though. Those conservative ideas kept Matthew from teaching Zand the same tricks, though she learned anyway, in the form of a rebellious JD. <BR>
	Nix left when he hit eighteen to return to Australia, pretty much disgusted enough to not call out of a desire to avoid Matthew. JD and Zand just had each other after that to hold down the home fires. It's not the Matthew was cruel, far from it. He was just clueless about being a father (especially to orphaned children), and Bethany, his wife, was not really strong enough to force it on him.<BR>
	JD and Nix both would swear that Zand has psychic powers.  JD, though, is closer, so he's the one gettng the late night phone calls when he gets into his moods. She knows he's a wolf, and was in Voletta for his marriage to Sai Zared.  Due to his teaching, she also knows about Vampires.<BR>
	Her short stay in Voletta made her realize how much she missed JD's companionship.  Since there was really nothing to keep her at home with Uncle Matthew and Aunt Bethany, she decided to see if JD would mind her moving to Voletta.  After all, she knows his friends there already, and family should stay together. <BR>
