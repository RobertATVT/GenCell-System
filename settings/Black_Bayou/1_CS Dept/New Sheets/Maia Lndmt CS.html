The rituals required to pass the curse of vampirism are  known to you.  You know the secrets of their origins from the Book of Ages:  "Vampires represent the human desire to escape the natural cycles of life.  Throughout history, mortals have striven, through vanity, greed, or sheer love of life, to escape death, which I must point out, is a very necessary aspect of our world. The Dark capitalized on this human desire when he made the deal with the first Vampire.  That deal consisted of the mortal becoming "immortal" at the cost  of his eternal soul.  Of course, no deal with the Dark ever turns out in the mortal's  favor, which was soon discovered when the vampire realized it must sustain itself on living blood. The Vampire does, in fact, stand a good chance of living forever, on living blood- however, they are not indestructible. The Vampire's soul is automatically forfeit,<BR>
   whether they actually made a deal with the Dark consciously or not. Such is the  nature of the Vampiric curse. Everything about the Vampire points toward the worship and fulfilling of the Dark's needs- the desire for paganisim and need for  blood, often ending in the murder of their vessel, or the seductive nature of the  Vampire and the manipulative ways they use to accomplish their goals. A proper understanding of the above will make a vampire's inner nature obvious.<BR>
       Although Vampires are doomed for what they are, they are not necessarily doomed for who they are. A Vampire's soul may be forfeit to the Dark because of  the way they must maintain their lives after they've died. Individually, Vampire  personalities vary from good to evil to neutral. The Light may not be able to  capitalize on their souls, but it can certainly benefit from the way they affect those<BR>
   around them. Some Vampires are the symbolic representation of man's darkest  urges and desires, while others see their time as immortals as an opportunity to make things right in the world. This is up to the specific vampire since their  freewill has not been changed, only their free-actions have been corrupted."<BR>
       Having studied vampires for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more  subtle abilities.  When a vampire uses a mastery within line of sight from you, roll  2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 18.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect,  giving you +5 to any resistance rolls (masteries requiring Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; can not be used while in direct combat).<BR>

You believe silver bullets are needed to kill a werewolf. You believe them to be creatures of the  night who change into a horrific beast by the light of a full moon. You believe  there are physical signs of the werewolf (unibrow, fingers of the same length,  etc.) You believe they cannot touch silver objects. You are wary of the dreaded  bite of the werewolf, as you still believe a random bite will do to curse you <BR>

Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false.  You know that the destructive nature of fire can burn and seriously injure demons.  You have also discovered that demons are vulnerable to the energies of the light.  Any item embed with its holy energy causes serious wounds to a demon.  When a demon uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.

It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  This empowering must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the water in whatever item they intend to attack the demon with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of faith water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the demon are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the demon suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The demon must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the demon heal faster at the maximum rate of x2.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

   System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
   Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
   Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
   Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

   System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 turn to activate<BR>
   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Effect/Description:  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed  the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an  illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so  much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will  negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.   The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey,  the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeting for attacks.  They may not be seen, but they may be smelled or heard.  <BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and speaking softly, a vampire can lull its victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  The command should be carefully phrased as a witty target could twist the command around if there are any loopholes.  The victim will remember everything that happens, but will not be sure why they took those actions (unless they have Vampire Lore Level 2 or higher and succeed in their Lore roll).  If the victim takes any damage, they are instantly snapped out of this mind controlling effect.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The vampire has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the vampire to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the vampire is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the vampire must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.   <BR>

Being the master of the bloodline, the family head has great control over the life force presiding within their children.  With sheer force of will, the family head can speed up the atoms within the blood of the victim, causing it to heat up.  Within seconds, the blood will begin to boil causing unbearable agony and damage within the victim.  Those struck with this mastery immediately suffer 4 points of damage to both Body and Mind.  Additionally, due to the lingering pain and discomfort, all die rolls for the remainder of the scene made by the child are halved.  The victim must be within line of sight for a family head to inflict their wrath upon them.  Wrath may not be used more than once on the same individual per night. <BR>

The family head can reach out and compel one of their blood to return to them, even over great distances.  This form of beckoning will cause the affected vampire to do whatever they can to join their master, even at great risk to their own unlife.  The called vampire will immediately cease all activity and and travel with great haste to their master's side.  Once they have been affected, there is no way to escape the call.  In addition, this mastery enables the family head to sense whenever one of their children sire a new vampire.  This knowledge is gained instantly at the moment of creation.  The siring vampire must email the family head immediately informing them or they may risk OOC penalties.  The bond is not fool proof, however.  Should the victim not be online, then they are immune to the mastery.  <BR>

Petite hands of grace and small feet are one of her feminine charms.  Hazel orbs retain the mingling hue's of emerald and gold fleck; a contrast to the ivory skin- fair and undefiled. Her gaze is absorbing, and captivates the object of her attention with unexpected innocence.  Atop the oval shaped face is a crown of vermilion tresses.  A thick mane of silken curls, that fall in shifting layers the length of her shoulder blades.  Full lips, like a lustful pout- a sheen of rust color frames the twin rows of pearls.  An almost ever-present smile of warmth offers the benefit of the doubt to almost all she comes in contact with.  She has a youthful fancy, beguiling in its honesty at an undeniable appearance of 22.  She moves with agility; supple exquisite sauntering.  Carrying herself with a silent confidence that lacks tainted vanity.  Her laughter comes easy, like a tingling of bells. Yet deeper still, at times, you can almost see the agonizing stains from her past brewing like a storm in her beckoning gaze.  Her voice is an enchanted whisper; lilted with a faint accent from her native homeland.<BR>
   <BR>
   Repulsed by insincerity, violence and ignorance she would give aid to anyone who sought to better themselves.  Tenderness rules her heart with generous degree, compassion her drive and peace her hopeful view of her forced existence.  Her ability to secure alliance with more stern fisted rulers is one of her strengths; her presence draws respect and softens even the more bitter of hearts.  <BR>
   <BR>
   Her raiment is classic in design, modern and appealing- but never allowing too much untactful exposure.  The curves of her inviting figure are flattering in becoming adornment.  About the slender neckline a golden chain hangs the length of her front, the cherished object on display is the wedding band she never wore in marriage- the murder of her mate Alexander having stolen her bliss.  Running the Banking empire with timely intellect, and finding a simplistic muse in her treasured book collection and shoppe- Dawavita; its life and its title meaning "a song to life".  Her loyalty to her family is undaunted.  Her every crimson drop of blood, and very existence is for their safety and happiness.  Her genealogy is the pride of the name Chapaev.  She holds the title of Lady, but her more spirited title is that of the unwavering loyal matriarchal head of the glorious and ancient.. vampire family. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><I>^v^ </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>~</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>The only daughter of a Scottish nobleman.  She was brought up in wealth and tradition.  Having been reared in grace, and mannerism.. she holds a very inviting presence.  Her Mother's suicide turned her Dah cold and greedy for power and hard fisted rule.  Forced into a youthful marriage of land union, she was driven to the confines of silent agony that plunged her Mother into deaths gaping arms.  The birth of her bonnie red haired infant son, and his subsequent death drove her beyond reason- and one clean slice across her husbands throat gave her freedom she could see no other way to obtain.  Her own near death enfolded her into a calming abyss of healing ebony; as the private jet whisked her away from her beloved homeland.  Awaking in a new place... Voletta.  She was safe from the accusation, but alone; she stumbled to embrace a love she hoped existed and a new family with old values: loyalty, honor and tradition.~  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
