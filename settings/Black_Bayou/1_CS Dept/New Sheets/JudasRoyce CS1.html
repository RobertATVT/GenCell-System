</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 1">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>The vampire can spend a turn shouting out a 1 sentence MS to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance. Each family member must have the mastery Call The Family to be included in the MS. The family must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this must be posted) for the mastery to work. This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed. At that point, the attunement must be renewed.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>	Small at five and five and darkly colored, he seems the picture of tarnished innocence. An easy smile flashes readily across his sad-seeming features, almost hiding the darkness moving behind the velvety brown eyes. Dark red hair falls in soft tendrils to curl around the collar of the casual street clothes. The clothes drape in baggy folds over him, always accompanied by a light denim jacket. A slight limp mars the step of his right ankle, worsening on cold or damp days. A rich 'tan' is always present, and combined with a slightly flared nose bring his mixed heritage to light.<BR>
	A suitcase of clothes is kept in the trunk of an old black and blue Honda Valkyrie motorcycle. Two rings adorn his fingers, gifts from the absentee Mary. One is sterling silver with a ram in relief, and the other a hematite band. A topaz sun-shaped pendant hangs on a thin silver chain around his neck. A sheathed bone-handled hunting knife is tucked into the back of the faded jeans' waistband of his jeans. A deck of cards resides, like an old friend, in a side pocket of jeans along with his wallet.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	The child slouched in a leather chair, one finely arched brow raising in query at the school principle. It was always the same. "The half-breed did it!", and Judas ended up here. The vast expanse of his cluttered oak desk stood between them with two manila folders on it: one thick and one thin. The thick one showed signs of heavy usage in the battered corners which curled inward as if to hold its bulging contents in. The label read: Royce, Judas Elijah. It was his name. The principle spoke, "Ya know why ye're here, son, right?"<BR>
	"I ain't your son. I ain't no man's son."<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>~...one thousand nine hundred seventy-six...</I>~<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Full lips pursed as velvety brown eyes took in the pasty white back moving rhythmically over his mother's smaller and darker form. He had known on an intellectual level what his mother was. He had always known. After all, that was how he had gotten here. Mary's first job left her with more than the thirty bucks payment. It was a lesson that hit home. He did not have a mother. His blood father some WASP his mother had played doggie for late one summer night. His mother loved him. That was not the problem. She had not wanted him. That was the problem.<BR>
	Sickened, he turned from the sight. In a daze, Judas called his 'father'. Giraldo Escobar had shown quickly, helping the smaller adolescent gather his few things and slip out of the door. Mary was a person to visit after that. A person to get for signatures. Or the one medical release for a broken ankle. He stayed where he wished. For now, that was with Giraldo.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>~...on the day of April first...~</I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	"Ya half-[ ]! What the [ ] are ya doin' here!?" The taller boy stepped in front of him, perfect blue eyes stared down the length of a narrow nose that lifted in contempt. <I>I shoulda known this was comin'.</I> Judas straightened under the intense and unreasonable hatred. But the little white boy would be surprised. Oh, would he be surprised. Judas hid the reactionary fear as well as he could and braced for the first punch, "It's a school. I'm learning...more'n I can say for you." He hadn't stood a chance against the group of them, but the blood spurting from the tall boy's nose after the first punch made up for the broken ankle.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>~<I>...there was born a child;~</I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	A dark fist slammed into the practice dummy using the anger to focus his strength on the bag. Always the same. <I>"You are so beautiful, Judas." The small blond girl from his physics class ran soft fingers over his jaw, sending a subtle shiver down his spine.</I> He knew better. Thrill of the forbidden. That was all he was to the girls at school. He wasn't playing that game. He hated them anyway. They weren't better than their little boy-toys. They were worse.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>~...a child born out of wedlock.~</I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Judas shook out the red curls, running a hand through them, setting the helmet in front of him as he got his bearings. A bridge on the left to somewhere called Isle Voletta and the sign for New Orleans on the right. He dug into his pockets gauging what he had and how much he'd need to make it the week in New Orleans. He lifted the kickstand and turned the bike left. The old motorcycle roared a lonely path across the bridge to the cheaper prospects of the smaller town. After all, it couldn't be worse than Eden. "Welcome to Isle Voletta", the sign read, "Population 27,423".<BR>
