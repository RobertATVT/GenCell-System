System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Wolf Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> -  0 Soul to use.  (##WolfForm##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The cunning wolf can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near.  For all intents and purposes, the Werewolf is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the wolf -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The werewolf will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Werewolves under dispas cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  Werewolves also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous.  In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone.  No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc.  If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the werewolf change into Dispas, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the werewolf is, provided the werewolf has not yet left the area.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

	Broken chains sing aimlessly.<BR>
<BR>
	She fell on the way down.<BR>
<BR>
	This is our story: secret unsung; hidden in a brain which doesn't know how to hide. The beautiful little curves (so subtle) are festooned with these memories: burns and cuts; heart wire and purpose. She smells of verbena and chamomile; something religious lingers between hazels and browns. Old, like a Cathedral: dying flame beneath the Mary. She has been Forsaken and Abandoned too many times; longing and faith could so easily be lost. The dainty angel lost her halo somewhere along the line; heaven and hell became moot points. When there is concrete and cold, there are also substitutes: declare yourself and orphan; it's easier that way. Forgotten God; animosity supersedes trust. Genesis, then; begin at the beginning, where an unnamed God begot (creation; dust and planetary movements; evolution) a Chosen One - how also nameless; she picked it out herself, eventually, this half-forgotten thing, feminine, trading personas back and forth. Something so hard to understand: she was never like the rest of them. A little girl at seventeen, self-proclaimed orphan (born to another pair of nameless people) the mortal coil fell last summer when the pilferer (and most recent host) couldn't be saved; Eve, suddenly, was only that again and for the first time. No birthday ('82, this round) and dancing barefoot through New Orleans - never so virtuous as she should have been. These things are only half articulated; she doesn't understand. Dementia is the only thing cloaking (sometimes) anger. <BR>
	<BR>
	But - back up. This last host, the one who didn't work and was by nature neglectful of such things, was Evelyn Mouvant. Mad and immature; a pianist and a theif; someone to be trifled with only on rare occasions; tarnished silver and decorated with the stuff. Altogether shining, she held a gun when she was fifteen and killed someone the same year. Enter the angel. For twenty-four months, there was a crash-course made of the skull: bone fragment; brain cell; it all became one and the same. She was closer to bipolar than posessed. Think musty hanging beads; dangle, the suncatcher, only to crash and embed pretty slivers in delicate palms (dirt-stained and scented with hishash). It became an elimination dance; something striven against by both parties - and they split into two again (nothing so nicely viewed as freedom, but rather as abandonment), leaving a girl almost eighteen with the body of a young adolescent, a mentality not so far beyond that, and Mattias. <BR>
<BR>
	I wish this story were better. I wish it were about falling in love and sunshine and happiness. I wish it were easier to tell; easier to read; attention-capturing - that's the basic connotation, anyway. She could have gone on longer. Pages.<BR>
<BR>
	They wrinkled like dry, cut-off skin left out on the floor: yellow and fragile, like thin porcelain. Parchment to crumble under fingertips, her mind; she ran into him in Paris. Try speaking the Cajun tongue there - they won't understand you. Except he was, too, from 'N'Awlins.' The belated, if despairing, saint with her dead-moss eyes and sassy mannerisms; she couldn't just fade away - it would have been some exotically executed jump had he not found her sitting, in all resplendant auras of smoke, on his front stoop. Not really what one would rush to consider pretty, with her long-ish face still dotted childish with light freckles; darkened hair (she must have been a towhead not so long ago) mussed and falling well past her shoulders; perhaps four-eight and scrawny for all of that, mostly flat-chested and with hardly a curve. She looked maybe thirteen, and certainly not his type. Which left to the imagination what she was doing on his step. Correction: -her- step. Apparently it had been claimed. But, so grasciously, she offered him room to step by - and they talked about flying, always; what the wind was like. But she was always the one with the wings. That's all she's ever wanted, really; just some wings. Mattias and Eve - such a pair. They set each other up and split profits fifty-fifty until he turned traitor or she defected or a mutual separation took place - and away she ran, blind little mouse with no future and cursing the past, back to Louisiana.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
