  System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
  animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Lamia Animal Form Request">BBSTMail</A> and for a listing of the authorized animal forms: <A HREF="aol://4344:1192.lanimal.9394883.595601422">Lamia Animal Forms</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>  <BR>

While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
  System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

  System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

  System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  I'm a young man whose been a curse since the day I was born.  I've suffered as the cause of many unintentionally lost lives which coincides with the reason I've been and is a curse.  You see when my mother's water broke and all the frantic usual stuff happened, father losing his cool and panicking, stuff like that. Everyone in my family (all two generations consisting of my grandmother, grandfather, mom and dad, dad's parents died when he was young) lived in a small neighborhood and on the same street so they knew and became frantic as well for the most part. So at that moment everyone was heading toward the hospital, so we left but then all the houses caught on fire simultaneously but no one noticed since everyone was panicking and in a hurry. The houses burned to the ground and all the ashes were blown away. This is only the beginning you see. When everyone reached the hospital and were inside, the cars (both of them) were stolen, stripped, and gone. In this little town there were a "large" group of outcasts (five to be exact) who robbed people every month on a random day. If we go forward past other numerous "accidents" like nurses injuring themselves, doctors becoming too ill to come help my mom give birth, patients wetting their beds... simultaneously...to name a few incidents. One doctor, luckily, didn't become ill but was not skilled or practiced in...helping women give birth...because he was a dentist but he helped his wife and sister give birth before (did I mention it was a really small town?) so he knew what to do. Forward through some more struggling and I am about to come out head first which was a single problem, then the power goes out because those outcasts decided to drive drunk ramming in to the town power source killing themselves and the power. Luckily the hospital had its own power source (large generator) in case of an emergency. <BR>
  <BR>
  	I came out just fine, a healthy 11lb. baby. Anyway we had to stay 3 days, me and mom, my dad stayed for a night along with my grandparents. The next day I was looked at a lot for some reason as I recall, later in life I found out it was because they'd all just found out about the house and cars. They put that and all the events that took place last night together pin pointing little me. The lights flicker as they put it together telling that the generator was having problems, just then a nurse comes up to my parents telling them the computer records of my birth were erased and for some strange reason the government wouldn't allow them to recreate those records unless my parents came to social services. I watched it all and discovering my toes at the same time. My parents then went to social services clearing everything up but the date of my birth for some reason. They give up and decide to let me know the date when I grew up. Well, things died down a little after my parents bought 2 large apartments (1 for us and one for grandparents) in New Orleans where the real pain begins. So after resettling down everything started getting back to normal except they, meaning all of them, 1 day decide not to wait patiently so that I could have my birthdate on my birth certificate. We all got in the new car and drove toward social services...it  (social services) came within sight when we hit a red light. Its right in front of us and the light turns green, (everyone has their seatbelts on, I'm in my safety seat in between my parents in the back) we begin forward when cars hit us in every direction literally, in the front, back, and the sides. Apparently there was a bank robbery which resulted in a chase. Two of the cars belonged to the police while the others were obviously the robbers who died instantly along with my whole family. I survived unscathed because I was secure in my own little safety seat and I was located directly in the middle of the car. The policemen, tough as they were, survived as well only terribly wounded but they'd survive. <BR>
  <BR>
  	I was later saved by the fire department's fire fighters after they put out the fires that would have cause the cars to explode movies style. My birthdate was lost forever but the government decided to put the year I was born to compensate for the loss of information.  From that day on the curse on me spread like wild fire, orphanages and foster homes burning to the ground etc. I'd be pasted on from house to house like a chain letter. I also joined the military for a short period until they considered me too much of a threat, so they sent me to my next home. Because of all the pain caused while being past from home to home. I ran away to come back here where the real pain began. I went around looking for a place to stay mainly a place for people like me. I heard of such a place near New Orleans here. I learned several skills in the different homes, I also learned in a home that vampires exist, I learned the most from this home. Which is why I am here, I believe this is the place for me because of the fact that these creatures exist. Later I learned from some guy at a bar, who in my opinion didn't get sleep for months. We became friends and I told him my story which is how I found out about this place he told me he'd just come from it with his life and that I should stay away. He said "stay away from Voletta because the creatures there will swallow you whole" which is how I found out the name. As I was leaving he gave me one last warning which was "beware of the vampires," so I came here directly after. Which brings us to the present. <BR>
