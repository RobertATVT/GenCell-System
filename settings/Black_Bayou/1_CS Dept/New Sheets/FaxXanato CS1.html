 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 (Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>
 <BR>
 Healing - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the Forum Director.)<BR>
 <BR>
 Mindspeak - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>She was born in Atlanta Georgia, to the parents of David Xanatos and Angelica Xanatos.  She had a fairly normal life going through school getting good grades.  It wasn't till high school, when she was about 16, she started to understand what she wanted to do.  It was there that she learned of computers and what they can do for people and how much money you can make on them. She was about 17 when she started to take some of the programing courses that they offered at her high school.  She went through all four years learning of computers.  She then went to college, when she was about 21, to learn more about them and get her degree in them.  It was there that she learned another kind of way to make money at computers, a not too legal way.  She soon learned of how to hack into a system and pirate information off that system that people would like to have come into their possession.  She was soon making lots of money and paying for college that way.  She graduated from College when she was about 24.  Shortly after graduating she was apprehended by the police after an anonomous phone call told them that she was hacking into systems hey soon came to her place and arrested her on the suspicion of such a thing.  After a small trial though she was set free due to lack of evidence.  She then decided she would have to move away from that city and away from anyone she knew once before.  Some place where they wouldn't find her. She then spent about a year looking before she remembered hearing awhile back about a small town down south somewhere named Volletta.  She decided that that was a better place then any to live so off she went down to Volletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
