These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some mortals have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Born in Isle Voletta, his father was a member of the Fire Department, his mother more or less a whore.  She was sleeping around with the neighborhood men while Aaron slept upstairs, and when his father found out, all hell broke loose.  To put it simply, his mother ended up in the cemetary, and his father was electrocuted on two charges of murder.<BR>
<BR>
	Young Aaron was sent to live with his grandmother, a life-long Bayou dweller with a penchant of telling the stories of her native Louisianna.  So it became natural for him to repeat these stories.  And soon, they found their way into writing.  <BR>
<BR>
	A shining example of the parish Private School's, Aaron's first book went straight to a bestseller.  </B><I>"Gators in the Bayou" </I> combined several old stories with a single plot-line.  Staying true to his forum, he worked in the horror genre.<BR>
<BR>
	Right now, he's working on a novel based in the town of Isle Voletta, called "<I>The Isle of Veils"</I>.  However, with the publisher's breathing down his back, and the deadline getting closer, he has only that....a name.  And so, he packed up, moved from his New York apartment, and back to his hometown...for material.<B><BR>
