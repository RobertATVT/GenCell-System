<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I></U> Hunter Steele was born in a small village off the West coast of Canada, where he had a standard childhood. He had a mother who was a kindergarten teacher and a father who was a police officer. This should have gave him a reasonable life, but it didn't end up that way.  When Hunter was fourteen he was arrested for breaking and entering into a fellow students home. This made his parents furious and made him go to a private school for two years.  Over those years, Hunter got into selling drugs to the students and made a lot of money over those years. The only problem was that his father was a cop so they were on the appeasing sides of the law. Hunter had made a lot of money, but one night Hunter's father was supposed to make a drug bust on a big dealer, this happened to be Hunter, and they had a shootout. Hunter had shot and killed his father. He was eighteen. Having no place to run he had found his cousin, Rick, who was an assassin, he had made a lot of money with hunting down people wanted by big companies, so Hunter wanted in o the deal. Rick had taken him in, but knew that he was in high risk of being caught. Over that one year that they were training Hunter got skilled at the katana and learned about many of the supposed myths that ended up being true. <BR>
	Six months before Hunter's 20th birthday Rick had gotten word about a big money deal in a swampland that they never heard of. But they decided to go. Soon enough, they were knee deep in Vampire County, this is where Hunter had lost Rick.  They were traveling deep in the marshes when out of nowhere comes a hungry vampire. The vampire had jumped upon Rick and bit him in the neck. As he was feeding off of Rick's lifestream Hunter had tried to get him off, but it was to late.  As the vampire ran off with Rick he could here his cousin say, "Sadly.... I'll see you again..."    Hunter never thought in one million years that he would ever come head-to-head with a real vampire or even lose his cousin to one, but after that night Hunter had ran off into the depths of the marshes until he reached his destination... The Black Bayou.<BR>
