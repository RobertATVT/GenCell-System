</B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

<B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

    	Solange is 21 years old, 4'11" tall and weighs 95#.  Many mistake her for a child until she opens her mouth and sings, but no child could have such a voice.  Her hair is long and wavy, blue-black, and falls to her knees; she wears it braided when it needs to be, but loose and flowing when danger does not threaten.  Her eyes are her Irish father's vibrant green, a gift from the Emerald Isle, and her skin is very fair; most people would never guess that her mother was African-American.  Her figure is slender and waifish--the best words to describe the way she looks are 'fragile' and 'breakable'--but unmistakably female despite the fact that she doesn't fill the front of her blouses with breasts the size of overfilled basketballs.  She typically dresses in off-the-shoulder peasant's/ poet's blouses of loose cotton and long, flowing skirts in wild gypsy patterns and colors.  More often than not, she goes barefoot; a lifetime of running through the back alleys of New Orleans have toughened her feet.  She wears lots of jewelry when singing--jingling bangles on her wrists and belled chains around her ankles, rings on all ten fingers, pendants with mystic symbols snatched from her mother's jewelry box--but nothing that makes noise when on the run.  Her ears are both pierced three times each, her navel once.  She has a small tattoo of a black swan on her right hip.<BR>

    	Solange's mother was black, a mambo with one of the voodoo cults in New Orleans; her father was a hard-drinking Irish merchant marine working on one of the many boats that carried crude oil back and forth across the ocean and up and down the Mississippi from Baton Rouge to the Delta.  The two made an unlikely pair, but they were smitten, and a child was born--out of wedlock--to the couple 21 years ago.  The mambo named her daughter Solange, Creole French for 'Angel of the Sun', and the child showed at an early age that she was a gifted singer.  Jazz, blues, rock, her father's native Celtic music--no style was beyond her grasp.  She grew up singing in smoky honky-tonks and backstreet blues bars to supplement her family's meager income, and at the age of 16, her beauty flourished.  Of a necessity, she learned to dodge, fight like a hellcat, and even shoot to ward off the advances of the less-than-principled patrons of the bars where she sang, who were naturally fascinated by the combination of her beauty and her singing.  But there came a time when her abilities could no longer help her: one of New Orleans' gunrunners saw her, heard her sing, and decided she had to be his.  He kidnapped her from the bar after it closed.  Her parents discovered what had happened from the bartender and her father, still hale and hearty at the age of 46, came after the gunrunner; he was mowed down by the gunrunner's thugs for his efforts.  Her mother tried to rescue her daughter her own way, calling together her group and casting a curse on the gunrunner; she and the group were also slaughtered by the gunrunner's gang.  At last, after more than a month of enduring as the man's prisoner, withstanding rape every night and knowing the man was guilty of her parents' deaths, Solange snapped one night after the man had raped her and passed out in an alcoholic stupor.  She drove a screwdriver into his ear, killing him, then grabbed one of his guns and fled the city forever.  The gunrunner's men search for her vehemently, intent on making her pay for their boss' murder.  Solange's  flight has brought her at last to a small, backwoods town called Isle Voletta, where she hopes at last to be able to hide from those who pursue her, settle down, and find peace.<BR>
     	Solange's religious beliefs are the same as her mother's were; though not a priestess, Solange has been initiated into the ways of voodoo, over her late father's choice to have her baptized Catholic as he was. <BR>
