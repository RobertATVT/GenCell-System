</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or GM or ST has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Volange</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use. (##Volange##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B>NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Even though an angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from angel to angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to be a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While an angel is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN see below / see below; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can become the epitome of what it was meant to be:  the impartial observer, making unknown subtle changes for good.  The angel becomes invisible to all sight, including infrared and all sound, though not imperceptible with touch or scent.  As an option, the angel may be visible to one other person, but no more than one.  TN is 22 to turn invisible to all and 24 to be visible to only one person.  Should the angel exceed a target number of 28, they will be able to touch and otherwise communicate normally with the selected target.  The mastery remains in effect until the angel is either touched, attacks or otherwise comes into contact with someone else physically. <BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can fill any character with a brief and overwhelming sense of compassion and amity.  If timed correctly, the person may follow through on some action they would not have done otherwise, i.e., giving to charity, befriending a lost soul, lending advice.  Using this gift to derive personal benefit is considered a grave sin.  This mastery can force another character out of their True forms (i.e., Horus, TVF, TAF, etc.).  If successful target is filled with compassion, -3 to Attack for duration.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B>There's an old legend surrounding the old Venetian House of Cortano, a legend that has thus far flourished barely under three-hundred years. It has to do with what is now known throughout modern-day Venice as myth and what the ancient Venetian State proclaimed as divine. Whether the former, latter, or a combination of both, it is solid fact that despite the efforts of history the walls of the house of Cortano may have cracked a time or two over the centuries, but they have never crumbled.<BR>
	The whispering winds of Italy say that it all began in the year of our Lord 1715 with the entrance of the family's first daughter for generations into the world. By that time the name Cortano had been in the Golden Book for ages, ancestors bearing the name from the very beginning of Venice's rise to supremacy hundreds of years before. And so it was merely a matter of the sole daughter, to be called Moira, coming of an age to be entered into the most influential convent until she was of a marriageable age. While under the care of the nunnery, Moira birthed a prodigious talent for history and a devotion to the Christian God. The years swept by; the Venetian State continued to decline; and in an effort to gain back the Cortano wealth, Moira was married off to one Giambattista Antonio San'Camiel, whose family was well known for its fortune if not for its high nobility. And as <I>fortuna </I>smiled, the joining of Tonio and Moira turned out to be prosperous both publicly and privately; for unlike many arranged marriages, Moira discovered in Tonio her true love as he did in her. <BR>
	In 1734, three years proceeding the marriage of Moira and Tonio and the year of Moira's nineteenth birthday, Fortune faltered in her blessing. There was an insult made regarding Moira's apparent barren state; there was an illegal duel fought; there was San'Camiel honor betrayed; and Moira's beloved Tonio died as a result. The House of Cortano and the patriarch of the San'Camiels combined forces and went to war against the offender and his family, and although they succeeded with their now legendary <I>vendetta</I>, the grieving, beloved daughter of Cortano had disappeared in the chaos. <BR>
	Decades passed, the <I>familia </I>Cortano bled on, and the famous Republic of <I>Venezia </I>gnawed upon its own edges until it ate itself whole when conquered and ended by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1797. When Napoleon in turn gave the city over to Austria, the Cortanos were nearly snuffed out. The once massive and praised ranks had been depleted down to a single male heir, who was only nine years old; and Venice nearly wept as it foresaw the near extinction of one its oldest and most affluent families. But then out of the smoke and grief, with an undeniable physical resemblance to the departed daughter of the house, came a savior. The citizens tittered over how young she appeared, how unusual her claims of blood to the Cortanos, but nobody dared to contest the lady's claims of status and cast the final straw that would make the House of Cortano die out forever. She came in, took over the raising of the heir Phillipo and the care of the family fortune, and vanished the very day Phillipo came of an age to preside over the growing-again family. And so the stories, the myth, began; for every hour that the House of Cortano appeared to be hovering on the brink of disaster thereafter, a mysterious, odd relative would appear out of nowhere and save the family by some means or another. This "messiah" was always a young lady who called herself Tobi, a name rightfully belonging to the mysterious ancestress who had vanished ages ago.<BR>
	The Cortanos would swear this young stranger a saint for the rest of time, myth holding her to be the ghost of Moira come back to pick up the pieces of ancient Venice. <BR>
	Little do the Cortanos know how close they are to the truth. Little do they know that in 1734, after the news of her husband's demise, Moira Tobi San'Camiel Cortano slit her wrists and stood before the face of the God she had worshipped since she was a toddler; and God, who above everything knows the pains of love, saw the immense love in the widow and had mercy on her soul. He sent her back to the living heart of crumbling Venice, healed her self-inflicted wounds, and gave her both a pledge and an angelic guardian. As an angel of God, a daughter of the House of Cortano and Venice, Moira, now to be known as Tobi, was to be patron savior of her own family for all time. <BR>
	In the year of our Lord 1995 a young woman by the name of Tobi Cortano arrived in Venice by train, set up household in the ancient Villa dé Cortano with her relatives, and proceeded to save the family from threatening bankruptcy by means that some might dub as miraculous. Only, contrary to historical tradition, she did not disappear the moment the House of Cortano was steady again on its foundations. She remained within the bosom of the family until when in 1999 Maria Cortano on her death bed requested Tobi to search for a lost Cortano cousin in the States. Tobi agreed, staying only long enough to hold Maria's hand into death, and caught the next plane to New Orleans, Louisiana where, once landed, she traveled on to a small isle where the cousin, said to be named Tonio, was last seen.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
