 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11></I> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>-  0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

 	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Laura Katherine Porter was never meant to be a nun; and so when she left both the convent and the good sisters who raised her from childhood, it was not surprising that her reason for leaving was that she was pregnant. Always rebellious and lacking good sense, numerous mishaps left Laura peniless in the Emergency Room of St. Joseph's in her home town of New Orleans, dying shortly after noon on December 22, 1976 and leaving a baby girl behind. The father, more exactly the man whom Laura had convinced was the father, dubbed the child Mary Cade after his departed sister and soon vanished with his "daughter" from the eyes of the a hapless government who dropped the investigation of adoption after money was tucked into its hand.<BR>
 	November of 1987 found Michael Domremy in prison for possesion and murder, and when questioned over the whereabouts of his daughter, known simply as Cade, he denied having seen her since she ran away almost two years back. The fact that her flight was provoked by years of abuse went unmentioned; and with Michael behind bars, nobody was left to search or care for an eleven year old runaway. But Cade had more gut than the mother she never knew and by the time 1995 rolled around she was leaving the care of the Covenant House in New Orleans where she had found sporadic bed and haven from her nine years of life on the streets. <BR>
 	Cade had met and become close with five others over the years, street kids like herself with the same gleam of desperation and malnurished genius in their eyes; and the six of them had cooked up a grand scheme to set them for life. They had revised and worked it over thousands of times, and by the time Cade was eighteen they were all ready to make their dream happen: they were going to rob a bank. To be honest, despite how it appears, they did have a dim clue as to what they were doing, and managed to pull off two seperate robberies before things went awry. They did get away with the money that third time, but an alarm had been tripped and Joey got shot. For two days the six of them were holed up in an condemned apartment building and trying to save Joe's life. But without medical attention, he died on the morning of the third day.<BR>
 	Riddled with guilt and hit in the gut with reality, the five left parted paths under the threat of being caught and identified, muttering weak promises of keeping in touch. With her share of the loot, Cade landed in Chicago two months after the theft with hopes of gaining entrance to the University with the high school diploma she struggled to attain over the years. She suceeded despite that her funds were seriously depleted and fought her way through school with a two jobs and a dangerously sharp mind. <BR>
 	Now, in 1999, she is relatively stable financially due to scholarships and promotions and is working for a doctorate degree in Criminal Science with her shady past far behind her if not forgotten. But on May 11, 1999 she recieved a phone call that shattered her sense of comfort. It was Gary -- one of the five -- who the last time she heard from him he was attending LSU on a scholarship and majoring in Business. But that had been almost two years ago, and now Gary was in Isle Voletta with the other two and wanted her to come down. It was important, an emergency, and if she ever gave a damn about any of them she would come. They needed her, but she didn't want to come-- then Gary told her what was wrong.<BR>
 	Three days later Cade signed a hotel register in Isle Voletta, finding herself in the posistion of reluctant savior and clawing for some lingering sanity in the chaos of their new situation.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
