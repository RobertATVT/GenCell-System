<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>He stands at 6 foot 3 with a lean and muscular build. Autumn eyes, sharded with sienna are hidden behind twin, oval framed lenses that mirror and hide the pains of years past all at once. Long dark hair frames a face of aesthetic features. A quiet, clean shaven man, his attire is most often casual, consisting of nothing more than jeans and a t-shirt. Several nasty scars can be found winding about both knees to stretch partially down shins and up somewhat over thighs. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>   Isaac Levine, born in 1968, was raised in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for the majority of his early years. A surprise to his parents, a frequently unemployed drunk and a waitress, he grew up in a home of mixed emotions. With the death of a younger brother, divorce soon followed and a move south to Baton Rouge was made with his mother at the age of thirteen.  He was sucessful in high school, earning high marks and athletic honors, but problems with friends and long time girlfriend Laura Delmonty would find him favoring alcohol as a cure all to his problems. Years and the suicide of a close friend only made the problem worse for him and not even a seemingly happy engagement in the August of 1989 seemed to help for long. Later that year, problems with work and his subsequent dismissal were the last straw. In November he was hospitalized with severe, though non life-threatening injuries, after a tragic car accident in which five innocent people were killed when he attempted to drive home one night from a bar. Found guilty of vehicular manslaughter and DWI, he spent 8 long years in jail, a time in his life which, oddly enough, brought some clarity to his mind. Now sobered up, or so it seems, and free at long last, he comes to Voletta to stay to find work in the attempts of regaining his life and the love of his ex-fiance.<BR>
