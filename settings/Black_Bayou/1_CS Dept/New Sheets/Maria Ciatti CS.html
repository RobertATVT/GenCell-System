 <B>    Generation Cost: 25 / Experience Cost: 75 </B><BR>
     	The prophets of our generation, some mean well, while some don't.  But they have a unique power 	over us, the gift to sway us, to tell us anything they want to and somehow make us actually believe 	it.  It's a good thing they're on our side.  They are on our side...right?<BR>

     Advantage:  Religious Leaders hold an incredible sway over the community.  Many people hold a solid belief that Religious Leaders can do no wrong.  Obviously this reputation can be tarnished, but until it does, a Religious Leader is almost always believed over someone who is accusing them.  The religious leader receives a +2 to any roll involving their faith skill.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
<B>Mind Shield - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (##MindShield##)</B><BR>
System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate <BR>
Effect/Description:  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when the creatures of the night try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  For the Psychic to keep this mastery in effect, they must continue to concentrate.  This means no movement quicker than a slow walk, and no other masteries may be performed.  The Psychic can speak, but if physically attacked, the concentration is broken.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mindspeak - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Meditation - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##Meditation##)</B><BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.   They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Empathy -   0 XP - 0 Soul   (##Empathy <target>##)</B><BR>
System/Duration: 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Masteries</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<B>Awareness -1 soul to use (#Aware#)</B><BR>
Generation Cost:  10/ Experience Cost:  50<BR>
System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN:20/ Scene takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Duration:  Some psychics have the ability to "know" something is about to happen.  A split second before the event takes place, the psychic occasionally gets a funny feeling about things.  When awareness is successfully activated, the psychic can add +4 to every initiative roll for the rest of the scene.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Extended Mindspeak -1 soul to use (as mindspeak)</B><BR>
Generation Cost:  5/ Experience Cost: 25<BR>
System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN: 20 /Scene takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Duration:  The Psychic has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the psychic to communicate via mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is one way, unless the target also has this mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the psychic is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the psychic must reactivate it due to stress of combat.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Durandana -1 soul to use (#Duran <Victim>#)</B><BR>
Generation Cost:  10 / Experience Cost: 50<BR>
System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN: 24 /Scene takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  The psychic has learned how to touch the human's subconcious.  With the use of this mastery the psychic draws out the fear within the individual.  They will become paranoid of those around them as well as where people may lurk.  The psychic must concentrate on their intended victim and they must be within the line of sight.  All victim's rolls are made with a -2 penalty.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Forces -1 soul to use (#Forces <victim>#)</B><BR>
Generation Cost:  5 / Experience Cost:  25<BR>
System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN victim's 2d6+Quickness/instant<BR>
Effect/Duration:  The psychic has learned to create a small burst of force with their power.  This is harnessed and directed at the victim.  One the roll succeeds, an invisible force slams into the victim causing 1 point damage to the victim's body.  Evasion is not added to the victim's Quickness roll for dodge.  The victim must be in the line of sight.  If the psychic wins the roll contest by more than 5 points, the victim will be knocked to the ground.  Any character on the ground suffers -4 to all physical rolls unless they have the wrestling skill.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Isolation -1 soul to use (#Isolation <victim>#)<BR>
</B>Generation Cost:  10 / Experience Cost:  50 points<BR>
System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. Victim's 2d6+Will/ 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Duration:  How would a psychic react if they suddenly lost the ability to communicate, but didn't know it? If they just thought everyone was ignoring them? How would other people react if they thought the same person was ignoring them? This works the same way, but with mindspeak.  The victim has no knowledge they have been blocked.  The victim loses all ability to Mindspeak.  You must possess at least level 1 lore of the victim's breed and know for a fact that they are of that breed before this may be used.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Vertigo -1 soul to use (#Vertigo <victim>#)</B><BR>
Generation Cost:  10 / Experience Cost: 50<BR>
System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Duration:  The psychic sends out mental impulses that disrupt the equilibrium of a target, throwing them off balance and rendering them unable to concentrate.  While under these dizzying effects of Vertigo, movement is slowed and difficult.  The victim cannot use any masteries which require any amount of concentration (Mental masteries).  The victim receives a penalty of -4 to all physical rolls.  Eye contact must be established in order for this mastery to take affect, though once the victim is affected, eye contact is no longer needed to continue the affect.  The Psychic must continue to concentrate to keep this mastery in affect.  They may not do anything other than move at a slow to normal pace, they may not enact any other masteries, nor can they speak.  If they do, the effects of the mastery immediately ends.<BR>

      Maria Angelica Ciatti stands 5'6" tall, her dark hair falls in natural ringlets over her shoulders, her dark eyes are trusting and innocent.  Simple linen dresses seem to be her normal attire.  She is petite and carries herself with a quiet charm.<BR>
      <BR>
      ~The Angels called me to do their bidding, the mortals need you they say~<BR>
      <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>    <B>  ~Background~</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>      <BR>
      Maria was born 18 years ago on Christmas Day 1979 to the Ciatti family.  They lived in Venice, Italy.  Her mother, Theresa Ciatti had tried to get pregnant for 15 years with no success until she became pregnant with Maria at age 39.  Maria's Father, Antonio Ciatti, ran a large fishing business in Venice.  They were elated when they found out Theresa was pregnant, however, it was  avery difficult pregnancy and she was confined to bed rest the entire 9 months.  Antonio doted on his wife and when Christmas Eve rolled around, Theresa began a long hard labor that would last for more than 20 hours.  Maria was born on Christmas Day, her given name is Maria Angelica Ciatti.  Maria for her grandmother, Angelica for being a blessing and an Angel as her father considered her.  <BR>
      <BR>
      Maria's parents doted on her and it soon became apparent that Maria had exceptional intelligence.  She learned to read at age 2, and began studying all subjects by the time she was four.  Her parents encouraged her in her pursuit of education and she was accelerated in school.  When Maria reached the age of 8, her parents were on the way home from a party, when they were hit by a drunk driver.  They were killed instantly, leaving Maria an orphan.  There was no family that Maria could live with and according to the will left, her father had provided her with shelter and education at St. Angeline's , a convent, in Venice, Italy.  She was sent to live at the convent and even with her grieving for her parents, Maria's thirst for education never dwindled.  The Mother Superior as instructed had Maria privately tutored during her stay at the convent.  She graduated from High School with honors at the age of 12 and received a Masters in Education and Computers at the age of 17.  <BR>
      <BR>
      During her time at the convent, she spent all of her free time helping the sisters and gave unselfishly to the needs of the church and the convent.  Not afraid of hard work , she could easily be seen handling even the demeaning details around the convent while keeping her pleasant demeanor.  On her 18th birthday she was summoned to the Mother Superior's office and told she was being sent to the states, that a relative had stepped forward to claim kinship.  Maria elated to have family readily agreed to go.  She packed her meager belongings and made the long trip to Voletta, where her great aunt was waiting for her.  Shortly after arriving Voletta, her great aunt fell ill and died leaving Maria alone in a foreign country with only the apartment and the things she had.  <BR>
      <BR>
      One night in her sleep an angel beckoned to her, rising her from her bed.  She floated with the Angel Daniel, confused yet unafraid as he guided her to a place she had only heard about and believed in.  Standing in front of the gates of heaven, she was in awe at the spectacular beauty as she was ushered to the lord.  When she saw him, she kneeled with respect and crossed herself, her dark eyes looking  up at the man whom she worshipped above all else.  He smiled gently and asked her to rise in a soft soothing tone and she did so.  He told her she was blessed, that she was brought into the world with a mission and it was waited until now that she must fulfill it.  He told her she was special, that her mother had given birth to her on the sacred day as it was planned and that Maria now must find the strength in the pain that she has carried with her to protect the innocent and the mortals of the world.  That she needed to spread the peace and harmony that she had been taught to the others.  There was a place in Voletta for her, the place was tainted with darkness and she needed to intercede.  He elaborated further and said she had untapped powers and that she was needed on this mission.  Should she show her compassion for life and use her gifts for the goodness of others, if something should happen to her she would be called to heaven to fulfill her destiny as an angel.  Confused, Maria tried to understand what he was telling her and in the end she did.  She wasn't like the others, she was an angel.. Maria smiled and nodded...and Daniel took her back to her apartment and when Maria woke up, she knew that she belonged in Voletta and she had to find the church and find a job.  Maria began to understand her powers, the lord had guided her to show her what she could do.  Daniel came back in her dreams showing her what she could do and how.  Maria knew she wasn't like the others now and she had her own mission.  She would be wise and only use her powers for the greater good in pursuit of her final destiny.<BR>

     Certainly.  I apologize that it has taken me so long to respond to your question.  It's taken me awhile to figure out the Angel to Demon ratio.  As it stands, we are still approving new angel characters.<BR>
     <BR>
     You will need to role-play and post your character giving themselves to the light.  Then, an angel will descend from the heavens and merge its essence with that of your character.  You will then need to remove all of your current masteries and special abilities and replace them with the special abilities of the angel.  Any angel masteries you would like to have must then be purchased with experience points as normal.<BR>
     <BR>
     Be sure to include a copy of this letter with your character sheet submission the first time you send it in so there is no confusion about whether or not you were given permission.<BR>
     <BR>
     Thanks for playing and have fun!<BR>

Ahhh.. alright!  I remember now.  <B>Okay, yes you can recreate your character as a Psychic as she was prior to the breed change.</B>  It's a shame that her loyalty to the light was only skin deep, but then.. it appears very few angels actually cared about the Light (God).. so.. no big deal.  :)<BR>
