 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B>NA / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B>Having such an incredible bond between family members, vampires have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during confrontational situations.  The vampire can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its family members as one, regardless of distance.  Each family member must have the mastery Call The Family to be included in the Mindspeak.  The family must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed.  The family member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their family name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the family member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Family members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

      Carrisse was born on August 31, 1978.  She has a head of crimson curls, tied back into a tight bun at the back of her head when she's at work, at the Moiriarti House front desk or let loose to dangle along her pale cheeks when at home, relaxing.  At work, she can be seen in a nice business ensemble, full with briefcase and business-type skirt and jacket.  When playing, she is usually in some sort of crimson getup, as per her husband's liking.  On her feet she usually wears silver high heels or her flats, when in for a longer hike than just to the Symp.  She, of course, bares the traditional pale complexion, covered, usually, by a few dabs of makeup.  <BR>

      Carrisse was born in a well endowed family.  Her father, the manager of a local performance hall, gave her all she wanted except a hobby or two.  She tried to idolize her mother but she was the owner of a small night club which absorbed all of her life.  One night she went to her mother's club, the Roses, and saw her mother dancing with a group of men.  That ended her concern as to why she was never home.  After months of her mother's lies Carrisse wrote a letter to her mother, Sharon, and her father, Maxwell, telling them all about how sick she was of their lives and how even sicker she was of her own.  She took this letter and put it under a stone in the yard, hoping that after letting out her thoughts, it would be resolved.  However, things continued and Carrisse only got worse.  She met people at the Roses, where she now frequented, who helped her fit into her own life.  This taste of wonderful freedom was exactly what she needed.  She took off the next night, leaving the letter she had written two years prior on the table in the study where he father would undoubtedly find it.  She added a note saying that she was going to be free and then left the house with a little money, a lot of common sense and her private bank account number.  The world was all her's and she had the money to buy it if she wanted.  This money, however, was just in reserve, she decided, because life was much more fun with challenges and problems.  She now lived for the thrill.  She went clubbing, sang at local hot spots for income, and then moved on town after town, keeping only the memories.  So why stop at the Bayou?  It is dark and mysterious and just what she needs.  It inticed her as she intices other people.  Maybe she could survive here as she always wished for.  A nice dark place to hide herself for a while... <BR>
