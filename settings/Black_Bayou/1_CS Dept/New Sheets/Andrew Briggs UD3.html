They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The cunning wolf can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near.  For all intents and purposes, the Werewolf is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the wolf -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The werewolf will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Werewolves under dispas cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  Werewolves also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous.  In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone.  No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc.  If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the werewolf change into Dispas, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the werewolf is, provided the werewolf has not yet left the area.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B>The werewolf has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the werewolf to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the werewolf is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the werewolf must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> To memorize a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs target 2d6+Mind (TN 16 for inanimate objects) / Perm; takes 1 round to activate. To track a scent, roll 2d6+Body vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>By baring it's massive, razor sharp teeth, and issuing forth a frightening roar, the werewolf can paralyze its victim with fear.  If successful, the victim will be at -4 to Attack and Quickness for the duration of the mastery.  The victim snaps out of this stunning fear as the instinct for survival kicks in.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Andy Briggs is a solid 5'11 200 pound rock. Everything about him is solid, even his jaw, his stare. He's balding, but hides it by shaving his head. He has mildly tanned skin and shocking ice blue eyes. Briggs is well-manicured, and he always shaves first thing in the morning. Wearing tan khaki's and a skin tight crisp white t-shirt most of the time to outline his well-muscled form, black steel toed timberlands complete the ensemble. Winter time, he wears a simple black leather jacket, and during the summer, a khaki London Fog spring jacket is draped over the broad shoulders.<BR>
	When in wolf form, he is of average size for a Timber Wolf, approximately 3 feet tall at the shoulders and weighing about a hundred pounds. Roan fur covers his lupine body, shiny, lustrous, healthy, and remarkably effective camoflauge for the color. His eyes are still ice blue, and that is what makes him stand out from the average wolf.<BR>
	When Horus... Andy is a gigantic monster. Over 7 feet tall and about 600 pounds of raw muscle, he's as big as a horse. The roan fur still covers his body, missing only on his palms and snout. Streaks of black fur mingle with the roan, giving him a 'tiger'ish look. Long sharp claws clink menacingly from his fingertips, and 2 inch long fangs snarl constantly, drool puddling out of his mouth. He will lope along on all four limbs, much faster than walking on two. <BR>

<I>Weapons</I>: 1 Glock 17, 1 Glock 26 (both equipped with silencers), 1 Remington 870 shotgun, 1 M40A-1 sniper rifle (silencer, night vision scope), pepper spray. He carries a pair of regular police issue handcuffs, as well as numerous pairs of nylon 'zip-cuffs'. Simple wooden cross carried at all times.<BR>
<I>Miscellaneous</I>: His home is on the outskirts of the island, far from town. He lives there with his pet pitbull Peggy. The house has an advanced security system installed in it, along with the dog, making it a safe home. Recently, he moved to a five million dollar mansion, which he had constructed. Along with bulletproof glass and 4 inch thick steel plating in the walls, there is a 12 foot tall fence surrounding the property. A shed (posted for), the walls structurally enhanced with quarter inch thick steel plates and triple strength door locks sits in his back yard. It is strong enough to hold a raging Horus, and big enough to house three prisoners. Andy carries the weapons named above most of the time in his vehicles (the Glock 26 is carried at all times in a subtle ankle holster), but at home he has a variety of weapons available to him, all military surplus. Andy could quite realistically survive in his own home for months on the rations and weapons he has stockpiled there (a bit afraid of Y2K, I'm afraid).<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	Andrew Carl Briggs was born to a single mother on August 17 1965. He grew up a loner, not really participating in any sports, clubs, or cliques. He graduated from Lincoln High in Rochester NY in the middle of his class. His life was going nowhere until he found the Marines. They took him in and taught him his true love, destruction. He was holding a lot of repressed anger towards his absentee father, and the Marines taught him many ways to release that tension. Andy's only love was the Marines. His life revolved around his commission. So when he was asked to leave (not because of any act made by Andy, because of <I>budget cuts</I>) he snapped. Andy has no one to care for, and nobody to care for him. He's taken to drifting from bar to bar, drinking up a rather large tab and gambling a lot of money he doesn't have, relying on his Marine training to get him out of trouble. It's worked so far, until he drifted into a small off-shore island near New Orleans called... Voletta, I believe it was...<BR>
	Once in town, Andy quickly found a job working as a bodyguard at Mycaron Managing Inc. He rose through the ranks quckly, his military background helping him in promotions. Right now, he is the head executive personnel security specialist, as well as an FBI informant and extra muscle in any cases the fed's need him for. <BR>
	On July 23rd, 1998, Andy was hit on the head by a falling can of beans in his kitchen. The resulting concussion caused some neurological changes... and he became a psychic.<BR>
	On January 11th, 1999, Andy was bit by AuroraShm. <A HREF="aol://5863:126/mB:265483:6298">(Ezekial : Vision - Aurora)(</A><A HREF="aol://5863:126/mB:127727:1667">Wolf Wolf - Rora)</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>He was infected with the lycanthropic virus, and made the final change to werewolf on January 31st, 1998.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>
