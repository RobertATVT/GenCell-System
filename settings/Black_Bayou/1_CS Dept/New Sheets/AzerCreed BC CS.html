<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

  Occupation:  Currently studying psychology on his own, hopes to soon take classes to earn his degree.  Has worked as a research assistant to professors at various universities and colleges he has been near, due to his large thirst for knowledge.<BR>
  Equipment/weapons:  One long dagger (small melee size), etched with various unidentifiable designs, on sheath on under-arm strap under clothing; one automatic handgun, also concealed in clothing on under-arm strap; a backpack containing several textbooks and novels, paper, pencils, and various student supplies; and a small leather-bound journal written in an undecipherable language.  Always carries medical papers explaining his growth defect and verifying his age.  Note:  The dagger and journal were found on him after he passed into the coma.  He purchased the handgun after he was mugged a few months ago.<BR>

  Background:  Azerin Creed was an angel, a representative of the Light, chosen to join with a human host, Timothy Zerin, to complete a mission in Voletta.  However, during the joining, something went horribly and inexplicably wrong.  Instead of the usual joining of host and angel, the identity of the host was obliterated, and the mind of Azerin was fused inextricably with the host's body in the same manner that the mortal's mind was.  His celestial presence was stripped away, and now he was now just another mortal.  However, even more was wrong.  A body is not just a handy place to keep one's mind.  A mind will quickly change to fit the body it resides in, like liquid poured into a new container.  Normally, the powers of an angel would prevent this from happening, but without such powers, Azerin's mind was as malleable as putty.  The mind of an angel simply would not comfortably fit into the new body, and nearly all of his memories were lost.  Timothy Zerin's body, now occupied by the mind of former angel Azerin Creed, went into a coma for 12 years after the failed joining, before waking up to the doctors' astonishment at age 26.  Now he is mortal, with neither memories of being human nor of being an angel.  The only memories of his past are distant, removed, and he sees them only as dreams and visions, that he does not believe to be true.  He believes that mortal is all he has ever been, even though he doesn't even fully understand what being mortal is.<BR>
     There were physical side effects, as well.  At the time of the joining, Timothy Zerin was 14, and the shorting out of cosmic energies within his body caused severe damage to his pituitary system.  Now at 27, his body has not grown, his face the only part of him that has aged.  For the past year he has wandered the Louisiana Bayou, until one day he, by strange chance, happens upon Isle Voletta...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
