<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Mark was born in Atlanta...he's not sure when since he was kidnapped right out of the hospital by a male nurse.  It seems the guy wanted a child of his own...since he had a habit of not being able to keep his women alive.  They just bled so much.  Anyway...the man took Mark to his studio apartment in downtown Atlanta...which contained nothing but a couch and a broken crib.  When Mark learned to walk, his "father" put razor wire of the top of the crib to keep him in.<BR>
<BR>
	As Mark grew, he saw "daddy" bring more and more women home...and watched every horrid thing he did to them, not really realizing that it was wrong.  When Mark was too big for the crib, his father got him a mattress, but still used the razor wire to keep him in it.<BR>
<BR>
	One night, when Mark was 13, "pops" was busying doing his carving and Mark had had enough.  He sat up through the wire, not making a sound, barely feeling it at all as he had all of his life.  He took the wire and walked over to his father and decapitated him with the wire.  The woman was still alive...looking at Mark thankfully.  Mark just looked at her stoicly and proceeded to whip her to death with the razor wire.<BR>
<BR>
	He then took to the streets and lived on a corner.  One day, a missionary approached him offering help.  Mark pulled the hidden razor wire from under his shirt and beat the man with it in broad daylight.  He was arrested and put into an asylum.  He was released at age 18, faking being rehabilitated.  He was good at that sort of thing.<BR>
<BR>
	After being released, he immediately returned to the old apartment to find someone else living there.  He gave them some sappy sob story about how he grew up there to get himself in.  He gained entrance...and when the new tenant's back was turned, he wrapped an arm around his throat and snapped his neck.  He found the panel where his dad kept his extra toys.  A curved switchblade and another length of wire in case the other got too dull.  Mark then went on a long walk west.<BR>
<BR>
	When he arrived in Isle Voletta, he met a woman named Celene deep in the woods who captured his heart...by offering to have sex with him in return for him letting her live.  This convinced him to stay.  One day, Celene was gone.  No note.  Nothing.  Poof.  He shrugged it off and took over her little shack for his own.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B>  <BR>
