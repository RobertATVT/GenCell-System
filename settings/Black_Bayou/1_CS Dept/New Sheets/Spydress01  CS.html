 They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 Corsica Lanheart was born on April 13, 1978.  Her mother died while giving berth to her and Corsica grew up with her alcoholic father. She lived in a small suburb of Washington, DC where she attended public schools and at the age of 13 got her first job as a bag girl at a local grocery store. She got decent grades and attended jujitsu classes every other day after work. She got her first boyfriend at the age of 16. His name was Troy and he was a Senior. Corsica's father disapproved of her dating but let her go out only on the weekends. One night Troy brought Corsica home past her curfew. Corsica's father was furious and took himself, his daughters boyfriend and a wooden baseball bat out into the woods. Corsica was very angry and embarrassed so she secretly followed them. When corsica caught up with them Troy was on the ground dead and her father was on the ground with a wolfish creature feeding upon him. Corsica took the bat and beat the wolf unconscious. Corsica spent every day for three months trying to find as much information on werewolf's as possible. She learned how to use weapons and how to kill her enemies. Now she has come to a city in Louisiana to hunt down the creatures just as they hunted her loved ones. Corsica carries a Glock 17 on a concealed hip halster and a barretta 9 mm in a concealed side halster. She also has a 12 gauge shotgun that she carries in a back case. She conceals this with a trench coat.<BR>
