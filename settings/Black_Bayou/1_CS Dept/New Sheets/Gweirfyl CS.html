System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> see below / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Every once and awhile, someone comes along who is so exceptionally gifted at something that their ability far exceeds anyone else's.  This mastery allows the player to temporarily add +3 to the skill that was selected for their Gift.  The player must roll 2d6 + the stat of the skill being increased.  The target number for the roll is 16.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill makes the character a Phenom.  This skill may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B>Examples:  </B>Computers (Mind)  roll 2d6+Mind vs TN 16<BR>
                   Athletics (Body)  roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

How do they do it?  Well, the miracle has been found.  They must be transferring their problems onto the slightly stooped shoulders of our girl, Denise.  Spun on the wings of gossamer smoke, she hardly noticed the rasping of her voice, the sickly cough, and the yellowed stain of nicotine on her fingertips until it was too late, and she was solidly deposited in the realm of the constant smoker.  Otherwise, she is what might be called pretty, though her charm lies in her breathiness, the soft rasp of a voice and the thin wisp of her frame.  She knows her beauty's strength lies in that very thinness of her body, and so clothes herself in thin-knitted sweaters and ragged cutoffs.  Too often she hid wave-blue eyes behind the curtain of her puddle-brown hair, but now that it is cut into a ragamuffin's mop to match her oddly styled clothes, she no longer has that problem, learning instead to meet her challenges head on, like she should have in the first place.<BR>
  <BR>
  She has two tattoos, each on the inside of her ankle:  a thistle on her left, a rose on her right.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Instead, the stench of liquor coyly wrapped itself around their dreams, holding them in a constant half-sleep, ready to defend themselves against the drink's power.  Their father was always the instrument, a large man chosen as a weapon for his weakness for the erasure of pain and a horrible temper that none could control.  The sweet woman he married was soon transformed by the drink as well -- she became  useless to defend, even in the face of her daughter's peril.  <BR>
  She remained so even when the dam broke, and one of Denise's "infractions" finally turned her father's full potential as an abuser towards her.  One hit was harder than the others, and hit just the right spot, and suddenly Denise was still, looking lifeless on the floor.  Her sister -- her twin, her partner in running away from the problem that was her father -- guarded her until the paramedics came, the one who defended her sister to the end.  <BR>
  Rose, the twin, continued to think that Denise was dead -- that was what she was told, and that is what she had to believe.  However, her parents knew that Denise had been taken to a foster home, then bounced around a few other places before she reached eighteen and suddenly.. disappeared.<BR>
  She did not really disappear, certainly, merely faded from sight, traveling the country and investigating other cultures and countries outside the borders of America.  As she went, love affairs bloomed and wilted, friendships started and just as suddenly stopped.  The only thing that remained true was her determination to find her sister, wherever she had planted herself in the world.  <BR>
  Denise finally found her twin in Isle Voletta, Louisiana, and found the home she'd been searching for.  Now she has the semblance of a life she'd only dreamed of having, and a twin to share it with.  Perhaps Denise has finally found a place in which she can win.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
