<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>    </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Born a little before the time of the Civil War, to a family of very rich, or I should say were rather rich, souther white racist planters, her child hood was one of constant segregation toward blacks and Northerners.  This is what fueled her to go down the path she decided to go down.  She had grown up in a family where her father and mother always blammed northern whites and blacks for their families fiscal troubles.  She grew up listening to her parents bad mouth those people.  She was about 19 when the Federal Government decided to remove the troops from the South.  She was close to 20 when she heard about the Ku Klux Klan, and The Redeemers.  She wanted to help, but was unable to because all the people involved in those Social groups were white supremices and thought that a woman was of inequalness to be even considered a member of such a thing.  So she said fine, and went off on her own to try and stop the "black menace" as she put it.    She soon figured out a way to do that, she was going to have to rely upon a source of greater power then even the Redeemers or the Ku Klux Klan, a source that had been around since the beginning of time.  It took her about a year to steal the books she needed, but she was able to do it.   She then began to implement her plan to try and regain the honor of her family.  She though had been an impatient person and had often found ways of cutting corners, and that is what she had done with this ritual as well...She had not completely done the fullness that it had required, she had skimmed over the text and read lightly and so performed the ritual not correctly.  She had little relized that now she was the vessel that the demon would inheriently be conjured into.  She didn't relize this until it manifested itself before her and gave her a proposition, either she be the host..or Lilith, as the demon liked to be known as, would take her soul down to hell with her as a solution for taking her away from her husband when she had.  Dixie agreed to such a thing and soon inherited the power she wanted.  It was perfect.  She then moved away from the South and decided to try and find a suitable place that was better.  It didn't take her long though, maybe about..100 years or so she had wandered until finding Isle Volletta.  She then decided yes..this was the place she would go and stay for a good time, to at least stir up some trouble.<BR>
