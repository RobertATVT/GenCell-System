<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

  Raven stands at a towering 6'7", his long black hair runs down to a little above his shoulders, his pale green eyes sit there, looking as if they peer right into your very soul. He usually dresses in what ever's around, though he prefers leather. Raven looks well built, quite strong at that. Hois arms are huge, like pythons.<BR>

 Background:<BR>
</B>	Raven was born on September 8th, 1950. His family would always tell him stories about werewolves. His whole family were werewolves. They told him that once he was age 18 he would fully become one. Raven longed for the that when that would happen. His brothers showed him ways tro defend himself by teaching him wrestling. <BR>
	At Age 18 Raven finally transformed into the raging beast known as: horus. He stalked the countryside and began destroying anything in his path. Finally he broke intoa  hope with a girl sleeping. His long claws began to rip through here flesh. Finally he could feel that she was dead, the raging beast was soothed.<BR>
	Raven fell to the ground on his knees, his fur slowly melting to skin. He peered towards the girl, seeing her face. He laughed a little finally coming back to his home. Raven's family would go horus from town to town, destroying them. Finally his family over stepped their ground. A hunter was on the prowl and spotted his father killing a child on a road. Raven's father died, soon the hunter began to search for the rest of them.<BR>
	The Lupin Clan began to fall apart. Members were dying. Raven became a lone wolf. Drifting from town to town, he's been told to be the last of the lupin family. Raven has drifted into voletta, looking for a place to stay. He figures a small town will do best to get away from the hunter. Raven's wrestling skill and the wolf have united.. He uses the full power of the wolf.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
