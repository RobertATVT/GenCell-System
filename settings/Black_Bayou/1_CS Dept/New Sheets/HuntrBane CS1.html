 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description<B>:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, not highest.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
    <BR>
 <B>Adrenaline</B> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

     <U><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> </B></I></U>  Uziel is a man of rather unmemorable features and proportions.  In fact, very little about him physically stands out from the crowd.  His stature is roughly 6'2", the national average for males.  His body shape is toned, but by no means is he Mr. Universe.  A lifetime of working has made him capable of holding his own in almost all of what he does.  Body weight is slightly variable from 185 pounds to 190, depending on the time of year.  Facial features, too, are unremarkable in any flaws or major deviancies.  Correctly placed eyes, nose and mouth are all the norm, nothing wrong with any of them.  Hair is a medium length for a man, a plain light brown/blonde color seems to make him even more unremarkable.  Voice is a rather pleasant tone of bass, yet not deep enough to be labelled as "odd".  Careful thought and action keeps any regional accent from permating his speech.<BR>
   His standard dress is casual dress pants, much like Dockers or the like, and button down shirts.  Long sleeve and short are readily interchangable.  Semicasual shoes seem to be the standard bearer, as well.  He varies his manner of dress on occasion, as his whim seems to fit. <BR>
 <BR>
   When Uziel is "on duty", his dress is always very movement oriented.  Snug fitting bodysuits made of kevlar, (thanks to the wonderful United States Government), are his normal protection device.  The color depends entirely upon his surroundings.  <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>    <BR>
    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I> Sniping Rifle</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>--</B></I>  The Robar SR60, .380 caliber, 24 inch barrel.  Stainless steel barrel, designed for use of law enforcement personnel.  Custom McMilan fiberglass stock.  Designed to engage targets up to 600 yards away, however optimal accuracy is within 400 yards.  Has a sling swivel stud attachment for tri-pod mounting.  Construction is designed around minimizing flash from the barrel, while keeping the sound of the shot at normal decibels.<BR>
    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I> Ammunition</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>-- </B></I>Standard .380 caliber slugs bonded with silver nitrate, and expensive procedure to say the least.  Bullets are then coated within a copper casing that will break apart after firing.  A common practice to alleviate the normal wear and tear of the rifle's barrel.  This also eliminates the tell-tale markings that all bullets have once they have travelled down the barrel, and are "grooved".  Ballistics tests will be inconclusive, at best.  Note, the silver nitrate bullets are *only* for purposes of killing the hunted species, and standard lead bullets with copper casing are for non-hunted targets.<BR>
    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I> Green Screen Scope</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>--</B></I> Green Screen, or more commonly known as night vision sights, are used in today's military and SWAT units for locating targets by body temperature.  Visible light is not a factor when using this form of scope.  Any target in this scope appears as green, with temperatures of 94 degrees to 100 degrees (F) showing as a bright white.  Such devices can be used to locate vampires, as their body temperature is still within the acceptable range of body heat.<BR>
 <BR>
   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I> Nightvision Goggles</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></I>-- Standard issue military night field goggles, these work off the same principle as the green screen scope.  Voice activated for on/off commands, with addtional voice control for magnification.  Magnification goes as high as x75 in x5 increments.  Digitally enhanced picture produces dramatically clear viewpoint.<BR>
 <BR>
    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I> Kevlar-Weave Body Suits</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>--</B></I> The very latest in kevlar/ceramic technology, these body suits are form fitted and designed for Uziel's body by the United States Government.  He has numerous styles, ranging from artic design to desert.  These suits will stop a bullet as effectively as a standard issue kevlar vest, and weigh roughly the same amount.  The encumberance is also comparable.<BR>
   The suits also perform an added function.  Thanks to the ceramic filaments that travel throughout the suit, coolant is able to be pumped through the entire surface of the suit.  What this does is enable to the wearer to appear to be any temperature, ranging from 70 degrees F to 100 degrees F, with inrcrements of .1 degree.  This is made possible by a small, form fitting, battery powered pump on the left hip.  The battery pack for the pump is a flexible Lithium Ion battery (Li-on) that is rechargable.<BR>
 <BR>
    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I> Anti-Tracking Bagettes</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>--</B></I>  Personal mixture of red chili powder, pepper and lemon juice.  Used to dissuade canines from tracking once they have pulled this particularly vile substance into their snouts.  Also works startlingly well on lycanthropes that hunt by tracking of scents.  Designed to break open upon impact of at least 5 pounds of pressure, or...roughly the equivilent of being thrown to the ground. At minimum are 6 packages of this mixture are on Uziel when he hunts.<BR>
 <BR>
    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I> Scuba Gear</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>-- </B></I> Smaller than the standard sized scuba gear, Uziel is the owner of a miniaturized version of scuba gear.  The oxygen tank has been built from a mold of Uziel's back. The tank itself has a layer of kevlar surrounding it, and is capable of holding up to 30 minutes of oxygen.  The breathing apparatus is also smaller than usual, allowing for a greater field vision.  The scuba mask is formed from a strong plexiglass, also built from a mold of Uziel's face.  There are no opaque surfaces on the mask, thus allowing for a completely unobstructed view.<BR>
 <BR>
    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I> Magnesium Flares</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></I>-- Special flares that are both highly potent, and very dangerous.  Primarily used by aircraft dropping the flare with a parachute attached to light a large area.  When stared at directly, vast retinal damage can occur, the effects wearing off over time.  However, should one be exposed to the flare at close range, withing 10 feet, the damage can be permanent, also causing first degree burns over unprotected flesh.  If direct contact is made with a flare of this nature, severe third degree burns will occur.  No more than two of these will be carried at any one time, as they are rather expensive.<BR>

 </B></I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>The truth...or what would be shown as truth?  Either way, it does not matter.  One man's truth is another man's lie.  His past is of little concern to him or those that he knows.  He simply lives for now, and the immediate future.  What has brought him here is unknown to even him, until you reach the most base level of his subconcious...and we cannot delve there.<BR>
   As the prominent psychologists of our times will have us believe, normalcy belies the most complex of psyches.  This holds very true...in fact, it rings of startling truth in this individual.  Time will show exactlly what is meant by one man's interpretation of this.<BR>
 <BR>
   Recent events have uncovered part of Uziel's past.  He is known, by the Government, to have once been in the military, but was removed from active duty thanks to psychological trauma.  Over the course of the past year, the Government has been treating Uziel's mental disorders.  He has also undergone intense combat training in order to carry out some business that they felt he would be able to handle.  <BR>
