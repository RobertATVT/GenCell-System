<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><I>The tale of the history of Lynette Laveau is a short one.  She spent her most of her years in an orphanage. Her years as an orphan was mot good.  She was punished most of the time, because she was a problem child. She would curse at the workers and fight the other children just to see them cry. Maybe that's why nobody wanted her. <BR>
<BR>
At the age of about 18 the orphan was allowed to go out and do for herself. The workers were glad to see her leave. Lynette wanted to know her parents, she wanted to find them to make their lives as miserable as her childhood was.  A couple of times a week she would devote her time into researching her last name.  After months of work she found she was a descendent of Marie Laveau, who lived in New Orleans in 1794 and was the most famous and most powerful Voodoo Queen this world had seen.  After finding this she completely forgot about her parents and planned to be like this Queen.  IF she had all that power she could do more damage.<BR>
Now, Lynette devoted time to dark studies.  Eventually, she bought an old store at a government property auction and started a small Occult Shop on the bottom and she lived on the top floor apartment.  This store gave her the opportunity to research by reading the books she sold and talking to customers, all while making a small profit.  After about 5 years.  Lynette needed change.  That's when she left for Voletta, because she thinks that it would be a good place to</I> start.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
