<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<B><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

Nails are bitten down short - no polish. No make-up of any kind, in fact. She's tiny; fastidiously thin. She tends to curl up into herself.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> 	Childhood, she will say if asked, is of little consequence. She will say that nothing that happened then had any effect on what is happening now. She will defend anyone except herself - but blame the same people she refuses to speak of if pushed in the right ways. Halfway through the time-honored thing we call life, her father left. He simply walked away. It was all terribley straight-forward: first he goes crazy, then he leaves. That's all there was to it. Life went on as it had before: the clock in the corner ticked; the sun rose and set; she huddled in corners because corners had always been her favorite places. She adored people but found herself at the edges of rooms, always. She hated dealing with people and needed to be around them constantly. <BR>
	She was born in Voletta and attended public school, but couldn't give you the names of the people in her class if life hung on those facts. She kept to herself; ignored - with all due grace - the world. She never had an outburst in school; never spoke unless spoken to; had all her work in on time - would have been a teacher's dream, except for a shoddy attendance record and a refusal to participate in very many activities. She routinely skipped lunch to play the piano. <BR>
	So no one ever found out: that the scratches on her arms weren't accidental cat-claw marks. She, so carefully, never cut deep enough to leave lasting scars. It would be a shame if that happened - because then she would be crazy, and she just wasn't allowed to be crazy. She graduated from high school with a brief psychiatric record - "request discharge; no diagnosis." Therapy had been uneventful. <BR>
	Terrified of displeasing anyone (because then, you see, they would abandon her), she entered the state university in September 1999. Everything was fine for a while. In early February 2000 her on-again/off-again boyfriend (she had a lot of those) left. She exhausted him. She was too picky. She wouldn't change. She nodded - this was true. It was only proving all of her obsessive theorizing right. We're all so cyclic, she'd say; we all spiral, over and over and over, back and forth - not like a pendulum; a pendulum is far too orderly. It's more like crooked tide lines. <BR>
	By the twentieth, she'd taken a couple of Valium and somewhere between fifty and sixty Asprin (she lost count; it was supposed to be sixty) and had her stomach pumped - twice. Though it most certainly was not a result of the breakup, that separation gave her a most convenient excuse. She never actually thought that relationship would last, anyway. The second time she OD'd, there was no way to work around admitting her to the psych ward. In looking for an identity, she had one handed to her - the identity of a mixed up little girl; how unfortunate that she accepted this one; how unfortunate that no one has tried to convince her there's more to it than that. And this - is where we pick up.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
