   System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift<BR>
   Effect/Description:  This spell enables the lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
   animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Healing</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
   System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 hour to cast<BR>
   Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a full hour to cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will for the lamia to start over a gain.  The lamia must role-play the hour long casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
   System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
   Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

   System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast<BR>
   Effect/Description:  The lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

 System/Duration:</B>  NA / Scene; takes 0 rounds to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lamia is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Lamia attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> This is the truest measure of a Lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The Lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the Lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the Lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The Lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The Lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The Lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the Lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way, however.  <BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=1 PTSIZE=6><B>Olivia was born in Versalles, France.  She is the daughter of a second generation mob leader and a French opear singer.  Olivia's parents loved each other very much but her father's responsiblities kept him away from the family.  Olivia spent much of her youth hanging out on the Beaches of Canes.  She attented the Versalles All Girl's Academy.  Olivia was  always a very gifted and gentle hearted child. She played the piano and took ballet for many years.  She was also very good in her studies but Olivia's true love was and still is Photography.  Olivia received her first camera at the age of 10 from her father.  From that point Olivia's favorite thing to do was to take pictures.  <BR>
    	In the summer years of her child hood, Olivia did get to spend more time with her father while her mother was on tour. Even then his time was still limited because of his duties.  When Olivia wasn't under the watchful eye of her mother or father, she was accompanied by her father's most trusted assitants, Jackie and Angel.  This did cause some rebellion with Olivia.  She also picked up many fighting techniques from Jackie and Angel.  She also learned many of her father's secrets about his mob family.  Sometimes Olivia would purposely try to get away from the two men so she could have some privacy and a chance to escape from her sheltered life.<BR>
    	When Olivia graduted from Versalles All Girl's Academy, she was sent to Cambrige University by her mother.  There Olivia majored in photo-journalism and foreign language. In the summer years of college, Olivia took up modeling as another hobbie.  To her surprise she was able to travel all of Europe, Austrialia, and many part of South America like Argentina. Olivia didn't just enjoy herself because of the modeling but traveling gave her  great opprotunities to take great pictures.  After earning two degrees, one Foreign Language and the other in Photojournalism, Olivia decided to move to the U.S.  Her parents weren't too fond of her moving to Isle Voletta because of the rumors.  Olivia's father had many connections in the U.S., and he felt that it wasn't no place for his daughter.  AFter some thinking, Olivia's parents finally decided to support her and send their blessings.  Her father insisted that he would make the proper arrangements.  This was part of the reason why Olivia decided to move away from her parents.  She wanted her privacy, freedom, and a chance to grow up.<BR>
    NOTE: Olivia knows how to speak 6 languages. She speaks Italian, French, English, Spanish, Latin, and German.  She also has a lot of street smarts which she learned from Jackie and Angel.  Fortuanetly Olivia has never had to really test her ability to fight because she pretty much gets along with anyone she comes in contact with. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
