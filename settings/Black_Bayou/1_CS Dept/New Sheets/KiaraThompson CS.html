<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  N/A / Takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When faced with danger, Mortals have developed the so-called 'Fight-or-Flight' response, basically a surge of epinephrine to enhance strength and reduce reaction time. Mortals who have taken this 'Fight-or-Flight' response to the next step, i.e. Mortals who have purchased this mastery have controlled their response to only the Flight portion. Upon activation of this mastery, the Mortal has focused his concentration enough to allow him a better chance to elude those seeking to harm them, granting them a +4 to his quickness while escaping. However, the normal time limits on escape must be followed.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=1 PTSIZE=6>  <BR>

 Background: Kiara was born in Billings, MT on August 17, 1976.  She came from a family that was a very close knit family.  Her parents had gone strong for almost 24 years, but right before she left for Isle Voletta, LA they were going through a nasty divorce.  Her sisters all left home and they barely heard from them.  I guess their own lifes had taken control of their destiny.  Her older brother she was the closest to until that one fatal night on highway 54, where her brother was driving along and come to find his car crashed into the side of a mountain and his body nowhere to be found.  From here on out she became withdrawn from her family.  Attending school, and getting her degree, she became a insurance agent and she worked for a rather big insurance firm.  Her life had been destroyed after her brother came up missing.  Her friends, family and other close people noticing her strange behavior and suggested that she leave Billings and try to put everything behind her.  The big insurance firm, had just the right opportunity for her to leave and maybe never come back.  It was a chance to open up her own insurance branch firm, and that's all how she came to know the small isle known as Isle Voletta, LA.  She jumped on a plane and never to look back at Billings, MT.  <BR>
