They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The vampire has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the vampire to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the vampire is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the vampire must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Over time, the vampire can learn to expand and direct the nature of its inner beast during times of stress.  This monstrous energy can then be directed toward the vampire's physical form, causing the beast form of a vampire to emerge.  In vamporos form the vampire's body expands beyond the bounds of its human shape.  The vampire becomes massive, standing nearly eight feet tall.  Its body is skeletal, any clothes the vampire wore would be ripped and hanging loosely from its body.  The face elongates sharply from forehead to chin and cheek to cheek.  The vampire's eyes shrink to mere slits, the pupils glowing an eerie red.  Wicked gleaming fangs hang below the bottom lip and the nails harden into sharp claws.  The vampire's mind explodes with anger and passion, almost completely overriding rational thought.  It can formulate simple thoughts and speak crude, guttural English (or other language depending on its homeland).  Vampires can feed normally in this form.  While in this form, the vampire gains +2 Body.<BR>

The assassin couldn't bring himself to kill the boy, and brought him under his wing to train him as a replacement for him. Snake however didn't follow the rules and broke the basic rules taught to him. He always went in the front, not caring who saw him and never in silence. Snake left his mentor in order to find a challenge in his line of work. At the age of 21, Snake entered the army where he went through basic hand-to-hand combat and extensive weapons training. He left after his four years. From some contacts, he heard the town of Voletta was great for people seeking adventure, so he went off, in search of a true challenge.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
