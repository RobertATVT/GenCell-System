Who doesn't trust their 'tender?  An icon from 80s television and classic movies, the bartender has become someone we believe in, someone we confide in...well, let's face it, someone we spill our guts to.  And someone we've trusted when they stood in front of us, pouring drinks as we made scandalous deals with dark figures.  What do they know?  What could they bring down on us if they just bothered to find reason?<BR>

<B>Luck - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, not highest.  The mortal can only enact this mastery once per scene.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Adrenaline - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +4 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to  add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Gift - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (no room command needed) </B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift. <BR>

Wolf von'Darkmoor born a werewolf in 1969, and moved to New Orleans with his parents when he was 14. He wanted to be a police officer like all the rest of his family, but instead disappointed them when he went the other way about it and became a mercenary. When he was 19 he parents left to go back to Scotland and disowned him. He traveled getting jobs all around the US. When he came to Isle Voletta he met Vortex, owner of CMA (Central Mercenary Agency). He joined up with Vortex and met James Mag through a job he did to protecting one of his pack members, and was soon after made a pack member. Vortex was killed and Wolf left CMA, he was then supported by the pack, in which he was Omega, Beta, then Alpha. After the pack died off, he and Kali went back to Scotland to get married and live there. He became a bartender in his own bar. After while things started going bad with Kali, his wife, and they separated. After living on his own a very powerful Lamia beat him and made him mortal again. After that he forgot he was a werewolf and forgot nothing else of his past but that which dealt with his wolf self. After sometime he and his wife divorced because she had become heartless again. And then he returned to Voletta to live and remember his happier times.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
