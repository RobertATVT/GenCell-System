</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

Generation Cost: </B>15<B> </B>/<B> Experience Cost: </B>75<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By making eye contact or touching the victim, the Vampire can stoke the fires of their soul, provoking an intense obsession within them.  Whether the obsession is a person, place, thing, emotion, etc., the victim will feel strongly compelled to do whatever they can to obtain the object of the obsession.<BR>

<B>Generation Cost: </B>15 /<B> Experience Cost:</B> 75<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs victim's 2d6+Body / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 turn to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/description: </B> Through a vampire's control over their own aging it can cause others, even vampires,  to unnaturally age simply by touch.  It focuses its mind on the victim's body, willing it to speed its aging process.  The victim will permanently age physically by two years.  Due to the shock the body endures by this process, the victim's modifiers to attack and quickness are lowered by 5 for the duration of the mastery.  This mastery may only be successful on the same victim once per night.  If one vampire uses it on them and another one tries anytime that night, they will be unsuccessful (regardless of the roll - even double 6's) and will still lose 1 soul for their effort.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

I am the spirited child of my fathers line.  <BR>
I am the unbridled passion of my mothers loins.   <BR>
Welcome me. Worship me.  Forever be my Pawn. <BR>
I am Dione. <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
My birth occurred when the world was young and people believed in more than just one God.  My parents, may their souls rest in peace, were underprivileged, uneducated, and unwelcome in the homes of most. <BR>
<BR>
My mortal death was dealt during the silvery moon of the Spring Solstice somewhere around the year 1450 BC. On the night of Resurrection, I greeted the ebony sky with the knowledge that I, Dione of Thera, would walk amongst the pantheon of Immortals and thus, change the destiny of the infamous isle forever.<BR>
<BR>
My father of darkness, Creon; a man of Cimmerian eyes and fiery temper.  Delivered me into the hands of the night not by chance, but by devious plot.  A political observer in the courts of Thera, my Sire had need on occasion to take action in the behalf of his noble pawns.  Although, I was not worthy enough to be one of Creon's pawn, my actions were enough to draw his unwanted attentions.<BR>
<BR>
A friendly game of mischief between myself and Menelaus had landed me right in the middle of one of Creon's insidious schemes.  That friendly game, with the hindsight I have now, was the beginning of the end for my life as I knew it. <BR>
<BR>
Ah, sweet oh so bitter sweet Menelaus.  My partner in crime. My adversary in mayhem.  Our friendship had been forged almost upon sight of one another.  Our relationship singed together for all eternity upon the night of my mortal death.  In his own way, he grieved my passing.  By his own hand, he fell into the pits of darkness and joined me in Immortality of a different path.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the centuries ... throughout the millenniums... Menelaus and myself <BR>
have walked the earth.  A healthy competition built between us, we began to pass the endless nights with our fatal games.  Mortals were our pawns.  Empires were our playgrounds. <BR>
<BR>
I am Dionne, known now by the alias of Tana.  He is Menelaus, known now as Martin.  Welcome us into your lives. Open to us your hearts.  Freely allow us access to your deepest desires.  Perhaps, if you are wise enough, you will also whisper a prayer for your souls.<BR>
