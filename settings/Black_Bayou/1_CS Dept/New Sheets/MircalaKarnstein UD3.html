</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#030000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>roll<B> </B>2d6+Will vs target's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B> Gives the vampire the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The vampire may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The vampire may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The vampire may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed, unless they are thinking about their breed at the time.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B> </B><I> Countess Mircalla Karnstein was of the noble family Karnstein, in a castle on the out most edges of her families land. The Castle which stood tall in the darkness of it's own world- was called Castle Karnstein- and was surrounded by a small village where most her servants lived. Little is known about her, since she exercises an ever wakeful reserve towards her mother , family , orgins , her life, her plans and everything that surrounded her. She was quite the young lady in her part of the world- she would attend balls of only the noble high society. She would charm the men with her tempting movement- her beauty and grace was so far pasted most the other young ladies- that she was always surrounded by countless number of gentlemen- wishing to take her hand in marriage. The one that stood out most from the crowd was Baron Vordenburg,he was the one that held the Countess as his idol and loved her greatly. As time went on- she grew in her beauty and one evening when she was walking with a stranger - not one that is usually seen at her parties.....she was attacked by him, and was turned in a vampire. She continued to go on attending functions as if nothing ever happen- and the man that truely loved her....Baron Vordenburg- though he suspected her of vampirism. His greatest horror with this was that her beautiful remains would be prfaned by the outrage of a posthumous execution, as it is customary with the dead suspected of vampirism. So with great heart ache- he told his beloved to flee while she could- leaving her beloved home to ruins- she ran in the night- wanting to exscape as soon as she could. The days continued to shatter on- keeping herself hidden... soon the days became months, years and so much more. Soon a letter came telling her that the Baron Virdenburg, was too attacked and was burned to ashes ........her heart broke as she read the letter....and she locked herself away...in a castle on the border of Hungary and Czechoslovakia.Soon the 1700's and 1800's were a bad dream - and a number of medicallly inexplicable deaths accured; women who die suddenly of a 24-hour illness where being reported left and right- till finally in 1899 she moved once again. This time she arrived in America...she soon became all man's dream of a wife- and tried there hardest to woe her into there wedding beds. But she refused and continued her hunt- her heart broken from a lost love so many years ago. Soon things came along- cars and so much new technology it was uncanny. She couldn't help but be interested in it all....she soon traveled all about America- wanting to know all it's splenders- watching the many films that are produced, and things of that kind- till finally she arrives in New Orleans the year is 1990- so many things have changed in her life time- her one true friend- her "Mother" figure has disappeared into nothing because of a hunter who wanted her dead so much.....that he tortured anyone that meant a thing to her.She stayed there until this last month-when she couldn't stand being there any more she moved to a small town known as Isle Voletta. There she was hoping to start a new life again- leave all the past events behind her....and start a new refreshed life as just plan Carmilla Karnstein. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>
