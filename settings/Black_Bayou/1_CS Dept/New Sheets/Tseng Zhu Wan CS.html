System/Duration:  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description:  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly-yellowed fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Mind vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies himself, is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon may take temporary possession of another's body with simple eye contact.  The real person's personality becomes submerged in their subconscious mind.  The demon has full control over the body of the victim.  The host body the demon currently inhabits will be unable to move, think, feel, anything while the demon is controlling the victim.  If the intended victim wins the roll, it is safe from further Control attempts for the rest of the night.  No victim of this mastery may be commanded to cause damage to themselves (jumping in front of a car, shoot themselves, etc.).<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This is the ability to manipulate the dreams of a victim while they are sleeping. The victim will be unaware that they are dreaming and will take the events as fact, until they wake up.  If a dream becomes too horrific (Storyteller discretion), then the victim is allowed a one time roll of 2d6+Mind vs. a target number of 16 to wake up.  Otherwise, the victim will continue to sleep until the dream has ended.<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Level 1 ~</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> The demon is able to control the type of dream a victim is having.

<B>System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Each level purchased grants the demon the ability to create an illusion with an additional sense.  Level 1 is sound, 2 is sight, 3 is smell, 4 is taste, 5 is touch.  A demon can make use of any of the senses he has for a single illusion.  i.e.. A demon with level 2 could make a fire that could be heard and seen, while one with level three could make a fire that could be heard and seen, as well as smell the wood burning.  At level 5, actual attacks can be made.  This is done using the demon's stats and skills, though a Will roll is still made to see if the illusion is created in the first place and believed.  Damage for the skill used is halved,  (rounded down) and done to the mind, though the target will see their own blood etc.  Unless dispelled by the demon, mindspeak wont break through to someone being effected by an Illusion, however, Hypnotic Suggestion would cancel out the effects.  A round of concentration is required to form the Illusion.  On the next round, the demon sends the Illusion out to be heard, seen, smelled, tasted, or touched.  Many Illusions can be created with this mastery, however, a new roll and another Soul point spent would be in order.    *Note:  If the Illusions effect individuals, then they totally believe in it.  Meaning the Illusions has the ability to affect them physically. For instance, if a demon creates a deafening, high pitched sound, it would hamper or possibly damage the hearing of its victim.  If the demon created a bright flash of light, the victim may be temporarily blinded.    Once the Illusion is over, the victim regains their Mind points, as the effect is over.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B> Gives the demon the ability to understand thoughts, even pictures of what is in a person's mind.  The demon may eavesdrop into the surface thoughts in a person's mind.  Surface thoughts are basically what the victim is thinking about at that moment.  The demon may not add, change or delete these thoughts.  It is only a spectator.  The demon may ask 3 questions in IMs of a specific nature.  The answers must be as specific as the questions.  The victim must be touched for their mind to be read.  This mastery cannot be used to discover another's breed, unless they are thinking about their breed at the time.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon can sometimes alter the way a victim sees things.  These are small, minor  effects that last a very short time and are intended to frighten a victim.  For instance, making it appear their skin is wrinkled with severe age or momentarily create a UFO only visible to that one person.  Upon success, the distraction causes a -4 to Attack, Will and Quickness modifiers (in combat) to the victim.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When someone begins to show guilt or the potential guilt for committing some act, the demon is capable of suppressing that guilt, enabling the victim to perform the actions without concern for guilt or conscience.  This works on with any one action the victim is performing.  After the act, the victim will be overcome with more intense guilt than they ever realized was possible (should be role-played in the room and posted).</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER> Not much is known about the past of the mortal Wan Zhu, before her death and then being ressurected with the essence of a demon inside of her.  When Tseng Su Lao began his search for a sinful woman, his quest lead him to Los Angeles' China Town and the Jade Dragon Restaurant.  The Jade Dragon was/is owned by one Wan Zhu, but it was only a front for the brothel that she ran above the restaurant.  The Jade Dragon catered to the unique and dark tastes of those who could afford the price.  It was also rumored that she supplied the White Slave Market with tasty morsels, as well as, importing and the selling of opium.<BR>
 Tseng found this woman and after chocking her to death, skinned her and through an ancient and dangerous ritual, entrapped his beloved Demoness, Naamah within the mortal confines of this sinful woman.<BR>
