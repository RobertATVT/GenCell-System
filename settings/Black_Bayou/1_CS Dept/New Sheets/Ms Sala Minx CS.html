 They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a non-believer.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

 System/Duration: 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

 System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate <BR>
 Effect/Description:  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  For the Psychic to keep this mastery in effect, they must continue to concentrate.  This means no movement quicker than a slow walk, and no other masteries may be performed.  The Psychic can speak, but if physically attacked, the concentration is broken.  <BR>

 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 System/Duration: </B> NA / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> By reaching out with its mind, a psychic can detect its surroundings without using any of the normal five senses.  With this ability, they can effectively "see" in a 360 degree radius and can see through any form of hiding mastery (i.e. Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, etc.).  This mastery only works within a 50 foot radius outside or a single room inside.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

  Height/weight: 5 feet 7 inches/ 120 pounds<BR>

  Equipment/weapons:  9mm   5 inch switch blade<BR>
  Appearance(clothes, etc..):  <I>This statuesque female may be on the thin side, but the eyes carry the knowledge of horrors that no one can truly understand.  The honey-brown hair is full of its own natural curl and hangs mid-back.  Although she walks with confidence, her demeanor is betrayed by that hunted look... very slight and most people won't notice it... unless you get to know her.  She usually wears black or tan jeans, black boots and a matching leather halter top and a leather jacket.  She refrains from drinking or smoking and drives a 1998 Saturn coupe that is metallic green in color.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Born Natylya Ulyanov on December 25, 1971 in Nyandoma, Russia.  One of five children born to the middleclass family of Pietor and Anastasia Ulyanov.  Susposedly having been born with a rare disease, she received two injections a month from her first to her tenth birthday.  She had what one would call a normal childhood until she reached the age of 11.  The Ulyanov family, with the exception of Sala, were killed in a car bombing.  She became a ward of the Government and found herself in a government instiution. <B></I><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
 <I>Sala found herself at the age of 15, being recruited into a branch of the KGB that delved into Psychic Research.  The scientists insisted she had psychic abilities, but all she had were headaches from time to time that almost drove her insane with pain.  During those times she was injected with some drug that eased the pain but left her in a state of euphoria.  The KGB then started training her as a psychic hunter in case of their experiments got out of hand.  Unknown to her at the time... she was an experiment herself.  She showed a natural apitude for tracking and her training was concentrated there.<BR>
 <BR>
 The next 12 years showed her the horrors that the Russian scientists were willing to go to for the desired results.  The experiments that were conducted were so brutal that she has developed nightmares and has yet to recieve a good nights sleep.  During those same years she built up a tolerance to the drug they kept injecting her with.  It was during a severe headache that she lost control and started destroying the records room where she had been currently assigned.  When the psychotic episode was over and she started picking up the mess and the files that were strewn across the floor, she came across a file with her name on it.  Thinking it was a regular personnel file, she almost put it back, but something told her to open it.  Inside, she found out the truth about her.<BR>
 <BR>
 Sala had been created in the lab, combining the genes of several world renowned psychics.  The injections she had been given as a child were susposed to have enhanced any latent psychic ability she had.  All of her psychotic episodes had been logged and there was no explanation with them.  A name was written in red on her file and circled...</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Arius Zaven.  The name seemed familiar and then she remembered she had been catalouging the names of those Psychics that the KGB had gathered information on.  The name stood out in her mind as she thought it was a noble name.  She quickly found that file on Zaven and looked through it briefly, catching the name of a place in the United States.... Isle Voletta, Louisana.  Perhaps he could help her understand all that they had done to her.  The torutues and the lies were enough for her to plan her escape out of Russia.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>
