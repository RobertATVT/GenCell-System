 Lore Notes: Cameron wears a lightweight jacket that I have mentioned in all of my lore postings. It has been modified as follows. On the inside, it has 2 slits on each side allowing stakes to be slid up and held by the material. Velcro straps were sewn in to insure the stakes dont shift in normal wearing.  Two straps per side, one for the tip of the stake and one for the handle. The blessed/killing stake is always carved with a cross for the handle so it isnt confused with the unblessed one that is carried on the other side.  The jacket has snap closure pockets on the outside,  one holding wolvesbane in a zip lock and the other a clear plastic bag of ample size to capture a Mist Form vampire.   A Mossad style holster is worn in the small of his back anytime he is out that holds his Glock-17. It is loaded with silver rounds, 19 in the clip and one in the chamber, ready to fire. He also wears a jade cross under his shirt that is a vampire warding item.<BR>

When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  <B>Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.</B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Generation Cost: </B>20<B> / Experience Cost </B>100<B><BR>
System/Duration: </B> NA / Scene; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  To some, nature bestows special gifts.  These people have the unique ability of using both hands equally well.  The character may take 2 attacks per round, one with each hand.  These attacks are limited to small bladed, small arms, non-lethal attacks and hand-to-hand fighting, as the rest of the skills tend to require the use of two hands.  The attack made with the regular hand is rolled normally and the attack made with the second hand is made with -4 to attack.  The defender is allowed to dodge normally, taking a -2 penalty for each attack after the first for the round.  i.e. If DavisMason is dodging this mortal as his first dodge for the round, he dodges the first attack normally.  The dodge for the second attack is at -2.  Each dodge after that suffers a -2 penalty as normal.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human soul is known to manifest itself during desperate times of need.  During times of intense fear or when faith is the only thing they have left, mortals tend to reach deep down into places they didn't even know existed and harnessing this energy from everything that makes them mortal.  As a result, the player may add +8 to the next Faith roll their character makes (only applies when a the Faith skill is used).

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Every once and awhile, someone comes along who is so exceptionally gifted at something that their ability far exceeds anyone else's.  This mastery allows the player to temporarily add +3 to the skill that was selected for their Gift.  The player must roll 2d6 + the stat of the skill being increased.  The target number for the roll is 16.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill makes the character a Phenom.  This skill may only be used once per night.<BR>

        Cameron Slygar was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on March 12th, 1966. His father, Robert C. Slygar was not around much in the first six years of Cameron's life. Being a naval aviator, his father was deployed to Vietnam early and pulled multiple tours of duty there, remaining until the withdrawl in October 1972. These early memories of his father in uniform would in fact guide Cameron for years to come.  He quickly became involved with the Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps. at Fort Dorchester High School, where he graduated with honors in the top five percent of his class. He carried on to the next logical step, attending college at Furman University in Greenville where he graduated in 1988 with a BA in Criminology. Cmdr. Slygar also holds a degree in Government and Public Administration from George Washington University in Washington, DC.<BR>
    <BR>
      After his commission in April of 1989, his first assignment was with the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) in Yokosuka, Japan, where he served as a counterintelligence analyst and command administrative officer.<BR>
    <BR>
       While attending the Defense Intelligence College in 1990, Cameron became an investigations specialist. After serving in the Pentagon as an analyst and supervisor of International Terrorism Investigations Detail, Cmdr Slygar was assigned as Force Intelligence Officer for Commander, Middle East Force Staff embarked on the USS La Salle homeported in the Persian Gulf. <BR>
       <BR>
       After a brief tour in Washington on the CNO's intelligence staff in the Pentagon, Cameron was sent back to sea in 1992 as Fleet Intelligence Officer (N-2) for Commander Sixth Fleet aboard USS Blue Ridge, Cmdr Slygar spent a year deployed to the Persian Gulf before rotating back to the States where he spent a year at the National Defense University's Industrial College of the Armed Forces and earning an MPA from George Washington University, Cmdr Slygar served for one year as Executive Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence.<BR>
    <BR>
      Leaving the USN, Cameron returned home to Charleston for a few months before deciding to get out of the hussle of the big city. He took a vacation during Mardi Gras and ended of discovering Isle Voletta where he decided to settle down and seek employment with the local law enforcement.<BR>
<BR>
	Cameron's law enforcement career has seen many turns since his arrival in Voletta. Being hired on as a deputy almost immediately, he was then drafted by the US Marshal's service for a stint with them. Upon the Marshal's withdrawl from Voletta due to the high casuality rate of it's people, he returned to the SD and was named Sheriff when the acting sheriff at that time stepped down. He held that position for a respectable period of time before deciding that Voletta had been tamed as much as it could and moving on to be the Chief of Police in nearby Bristle, Louisiana where he purchased a home.  The desk job proved too boring for him, so once again he returned to Voletta as a deputy. His latest job change is to the position he desired all along, but not under the circumstances he had hoped for.  With the death of Andrew Trask as SAC, the FBI came looking to replace him and increase the agency's presence on the Isle.  Cameron and his wife Catherine both stepped up to the challange, and when it was all said and done, were the newest Special Agents for the FBI.<BR>
