<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Alexandra "Zand" Honor Dagenar is the younger sister of Sebastian Jareth "JD" Dagenar (SN: Bast Dagenar), and Nicholas Graham "Nix" Dagenar.  She is three years younger than JD, born March 13th, 1977.  She is feisty, domineering, strongwilled, and the only person that can shame JD into making an apology.  She is short, delicately built, with light brown hair and pale violet eyes.  She sometimes writes poetry, when the mood strikes her.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>The Dagenar family are native Australians. Parents Steven and Ann Dagenar were killed in a car wreck outside of Melbourne twelve/thirteen years ago. The children went to America, and they're only living relative, Matthew Dagenar. Matt had been naturalized through marriage, and was a Vampire hunter.  Zand was 7.<BR>
	Matthew taught JD in "the Trade", since Nicholas showed less interest than his father had in it. Relations are strained between Nix and Matt. He'd lost even the hint of Catholicism years ago, but he remained too conservative to tacitly accept Nix's sexual preferences or career choice. JD and Zand never cared - they're younger, though. Those conservative ideas kept Matthew from teaching Zand the same tricks, though she learned anyway, in the form of a rebellious JD. <BR>
	Nix left when he hit eighteen to return to Australia, pretty much disgusted enough to not call out of a desire to avoid Matthew. JD and Zand just had each other after that to hold down the home fires. It's not the Matthew was cruel, far from it. He was just clueless about being a father (especially to orphaned children), and Bethany, his wife, was not really strong enough to force it on him.<BR>
	JD and Nix both would swear that Zand has psychic powers.  JD, though, is closer, so he's the one gettng the late night phone calls when he gets into his moods. She knows he's a wolf, and was in Voletta for his marriage to Sai Zared.  Due to his teaching, she also knows about Vampires.<BR>
	Her short stay in Voletta made her realize how much she missed JD's companionship.  Since there was really nothing to keep her at home with Uncle Matthew and Aunt Bethany, she decided to see if JD would mind her moving to Voletta.  After all, she knows his friends there already, and family should stay together. <BR>
