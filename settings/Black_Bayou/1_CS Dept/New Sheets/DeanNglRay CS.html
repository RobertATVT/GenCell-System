 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
 Effect/Description: A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.   A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A>.)<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>          Dean, or Nigel, as was his name while he was a child, was dark and reserved. Handsome but sinister-looking, he stayed away from family gatherings, church, and never even prayed with them.  Originally born in Manchester, England, he lived with his mother, father, and his kid sister, Hayley.  When his father lost his job, they had to move to a small apartment just outside of Liverpool.  That same year, his mother died of starvation, as she had always been giving her food to Hayley and himself.  After that, he left and struck out on his own.<BR>
 <BR>
        His sister, Hayley, had always been bright, cheery, and a straight-A student.  She loved to read and learn, the only thing they had in common.  While she veered toward church and goodness, he had learned of the Dark One and the powers of his minions.  He easily made it through college, as the intelligence ran in the family.  He travelled, looking for the ideal place to live, and found Voletta, ironically enough, discovering it to be the same place Hayley ended up.  Moving into a small apartment, he prepared to meet the locals.<BR>
