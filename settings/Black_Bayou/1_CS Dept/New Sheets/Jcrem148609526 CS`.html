</B>The arena is dark.  You take a few steps out into the open.  Unable to see, you still know exactly where your ax is.  Reaching over, you feel its familiar neck brush against your fingers.  You take it, tossing the strap over your shoulder.  Then, you hear it.  The subtle 1-2-3 count of the symbol.  Then.. BLAM!  The pyrotechnics explode and you follow suit, fingers flying as the huge crowd cheers.<BR>

<B>Advantage: </B>Being a well known musician at the Symposium is an advantage all in itself.  However, musician characters are inherently quick and precise.  They receive a +3 to their Music Skill.  Those with the Musician Occupation are also allowed to learn as many instruments as they wish under one Music Skill.  (Those without this Occupation must purchase a separate Music Skill for every instrument they wish to learn.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#030000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Background:  Jesse grew up mostly in Shereveport, Louisiana. When he was Two years of age his father left his mother and him to play in his band. At the age of twelve, after his mother had divorced his adopted father, due to the man beating him, he had a chance to see his biological father once more. After a short stint of thirty-minutes the two parted ways. Jesse happy about finally meeting his father left for Shreveport again, only to learn that his mother had remarried after two months of being divorced. The man she had remarried was in the Navy, and he quickly learned about moving around in the military. The family was to be shipped off to Iceland for two years.  Right before the move happened Jesse Received a letter in the mail from his biological father. The letter bluntly stated, and not in these kind of words:<BR>
<BR>
		" I hate your guts and never want to see you again....."<BR>
<BR>
	Jesse was of course very upset about this letter and only through the help of his eight year old sister did he get through it. After the two years in Iceland and a short stay in New Hampshire, his mother got yet another Divorce and the family moved down to Dallas, Texas. Jesse, once there became involved in Boxing and a few other extracurricular activities, so to speak. Trying to help raise his sister and dealing with a full-time single working mother, he raised himself and soon was raising his sister.<BR>
	When Jesse was 19 years and a high-school grad, he joined the Army as a Chemicals Specialist. After two years in the military, realizing that he was quickly becoming an Alcoholic, and many Article Fifteen's later, he decided to leave the military and head back to Texas. <BR>
	During a one-night stand, the woman became pregnant with his child. Not getting along with the female to well was beginning to devastate him due to the fact of him not knowing if was going to be able to properly raise his child. The chance would never come. Both died during birth, because of the Doctor's mistreatment.<BR>
	Spending the next few months alone and not talking to his mother, sister or adopted father he finally came to a decision. To get away from all of it. After making a phone call to his mother, sister and Adopted father, he packed a few things threw them on the back of his Nine-Eighty-Seven Sportster Harley and headed down towards Volletta.<BR>
