<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Psychics have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / see below; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mental energies after utilizing the power of the mind, a psychic needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  By sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman while chanting, the psychic can slowly restore their soul.  They must meditate in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  It is difficult for a Psychic to keep their wits about them, and even more difficult when outside forces try to penetrate their mind.  By blocking everything out, they can prevent anyone from manipulating their mind, thus adding +3 to their defensive Will rolls.  Because the psychic is so mentally adept, no concentration is necessary to keep this mastery active.  It may only be used once per Scene, but psychics can use any other mastery they own or act as they wish while this one is active.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the psychic is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the psychic attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The Psychic has learned how to touch the human's subconscious.  With the use of this mastery the Psychic brings forth the fear within an individual to the surface.  They will become leery of those around them, and paranoid of where <I>they</I> may be lurking.  Once the initial seed is planted in the targets mind, the Psychic no longer has to concentrate, but must remain in line of sight to keep the mastery empowered.  All victims' rolls are made with a -2 penalty.<BR>

His/her face is narrow, and long, straight hair falls into his/her green eyes.  His/her skin is pale, creamy white, and his/her face is flawless.  His/her voice is a little deep sounding, but pretty and melodious.  S/he has both ears pierced only once, and usually wears studs or teardrop crystal earrings.  S/he usualy dresses flamboyantly, in poets shirts and black slacks, or in lovely long dresses, but is seen on more than one occation sporting jeans and a T shirt.  When wearing clothing that enhances her small bust and slender hips, and makeup skillfully applied, Robin is the picture of feminin beauty.  When he wears very masculine cut and styled clothing that hides the minimal bust and hips, and with a simple shift in how he holds himself, Puck could pass for the star baseball player on the boys' league.  S/he is well-groomed, and has a lust of sweet-smelling perfumes, and has an assortment of cosmetics for all occations.  Has a strand of metalic green, metalic gold, and metalic red Mardi Gras beads that s/he uses as a focus (divided into three necklaces, all must be worn to have affect).<BR>

	Picture growing up in the perfect life on Isle Voletta.  You have friends by the score, boys chase after you, and you let them.  You have loving parents, and a good summer job.  You've pulled excellent grades in shool, and have nearly a perfect attendance record (heck, nobody expects you to go in with strep thorat and the measles, do they?).  You're popular, and your parents think you're the perfect daughter.  But somehow you don't feel like the perfect daughter.  You're more of a tomboy than any of the other girls were growing up.  You have something of a violent streak, though you're slow to anger.  You like the boys chasing you, but you wouldn't mind the girls joining in either, which is downright scarry, given how you father and mother think of such things.  You're tougher than any of the other girls.  So much so that your younger siblings, a boy and a girl, get teased constantly about their "Big Brother Robin."  So you, Robin Elizabeth Goodfellow, are a little put off by your own actions, but blow them off as just being something that you'll grow out of.<BR>
	That was how life was for Robin until she turned 17.  It was springtime, and the last play of the year, "A Midsummer Night's Dream," was going to be showing for three nights at the highschool theater.  Robin was one of the stars of the show- she got the part of Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, much to the amusement of the teachers, staff, and other students.  She was looking forward to the preformance, but had been severely troubled by the fact that, at 17, she had yet to develope fully.  Her mother took her to the doctor for a routine well-woman checkup, Robin's first, and the results were disasterous.  The doctor informed her, on the afternoon before the opening preformance, that "she" was not female.<BR>
<BR>
	((In utero, all fetuses, whether male or female, start out with a predisposition to be female, in spite of the chromosomes.  The only thing that prevents a male from developing as a female are certain "turn on" genes.  When these genes fail to work in the uterus, the infant, in spite of having a completely normal XY chromosome pattern, developes a female body.  The penis is non-existant, and the testicals develope within the body, rendering them usless.  Small breasts develope due to lack of testosterone development by the testicals, but the child does not cycle, having no overies or uterus.  The voice does not deepen, but is not as high as female voices usually are.  I looked it up.))<BR>
<BR>
	This is what happened to Robin.  She lost her mind.<BR>
	The next memory she had was a few minutes later, with her mother and the doctor both gripping their ears in pain, though she'd not heard a sound made from anyone.  Apparently she'd "screamed" in her mind... and the doctor and her mother both heard it in theirs.  About that time she figured that no matter what else, she was *not* going home.  While the two adults were still concussed, she grabbed her clothes and split.  She didn't go home that night, nor any night after that.  Instead she ran away and lived with one of her older friends at her apartment.  She dropped out of school and started working in a laundromat for minimum wage on a parttime basis.  While she had free time she studied at the library, both about her condition and about her new-found ability to "hear" other people talking in her head.  She slowly lost her grip on reality, and as her 18th birthday passed, she was no longer completely mentally stable.  Her identity of herself split into the "male" Puck and the "female" Robin, though she doesn't have multiple personalities.  S/he simply thinks of him/herself as being male, female, or both at any given moment.  S/he has a limited understanding of what a psychic is and what her powers are.  What understanding she does have is a bit skewed by her perception that she is actually Puck Robin Goodfellow, the fairy from "A Midsummer Night's Dream."  S/he believes in magic and in otherworldly creatures, but without any proof save what her twisted mind was able to put together from her reading.  In spite of her insanity, she's a friendly, cheerful person, very courteous and kind, and rather loving.<BR>
