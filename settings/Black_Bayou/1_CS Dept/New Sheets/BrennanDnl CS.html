     <BR>
     Volange - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##Volange##)<BR>
     System/Duration: NA / NA; take 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
     Effect/Description:  Even though an Angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the Angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from Angel to Angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to me a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to ANT Email.  There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The Angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious. The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form. <BR>
      <BR>
     The Gift of Life - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (##GiftLife <target>##)<BR>
     System/Duration: roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18; takes 2 rounds to activate<BR>
     Effect/Description:  The Angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring a re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or Gamemaster has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>
       <BR>
     Healing - 0 XP - 0 Soul  (no room command needed)<BR>
     System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
     Effect/Description: Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the Angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds from fire or desecrated weapons heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the hour is over, the healing process is disrupted and the hour starts over.  The damage from an attack, which removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-playing the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the Forum Director.)<BR>
     <BR>
     Mindspeak - 0 XP - 0 Soul   (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)<BR>
     System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
     Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the Angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
 Effect/Description:  </B>Aside from the normal duties of an angel, an Archangel is also responsible for keeping an eye on the members of their flock, looking for signs of corruption.  By simply making eye contact, the Archangel can peer into the thoughts and memories of any of their fellow angels.  The Archangel does not have to be visible to activate this mastery.  The angel being probed would be completely unaware of the Archangel's actions.  In fact, only angels achieving this lofty status know this ability exists.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I>Experience Point Cost: </B>Innate<B><BR>
 System/Duration: </B>NA/NA; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
 Effect/Description: </B>An Archangel is a being that has transcended the need for a physical form.  In fact, their native form is that of a spirit, a being a pure energy.  As such, they have the ability to materialize and dematerialize at will.  While in this natural state, space and time hold no meaning for them.  This does not mean they may travel back and forth through time at will.  It means the Archangel may appear anywhere they choose instantly.  A dematerialized Archangel may not be detected in any way.  They are completely invisible to all the senses, including extraordinary ones.  This means they are also immune to all forms of attack and may not be targeted by any masteries, except the Mindspeak of members in their flock.  Transcendent beings that encounter each other are able to interact  as normal.  Many times, high ranking spiritual beings battle each other in the mortal world without humanity ever knowing.<BR>

    Brennan stands 6'1 and weight about 165lbs.  Tanned from the outside, he is quick to flash a lopsided smile that curls up the left corner of his mouth.  Eyes are tawny, nearly gold, and perhaps the oddest feature about him.  His face is strong and angled with sharp plains, a staight nose and high set cheekbones.  He wears his hair to his shoulders where it falls in looping curls of pulm-wine.  Both ears are pierced with two silver hoops in each one.  He has a tattoo of Celtic lions that wind about his left bicep, a tribal pattern that crossed up his hip, and what looks like thorns around his right ankle.  Normally he can be found wearing a beat up leather biker jacket, a t-shirt (either promoting Tang or Mr. Peabody and His Boy Sherman) and a pair of ragged Levi's lowslung with the knees out. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>     Named Ariel, Lion of God, when he was breathed into creation by the Lord, Brennan has walked the earth both mortal and angelic since before time began.  In his current state, he is a muscian and social worker that lives happily with Phoebe on the outskirts of the town.  The story of Ariel and Phoebe is a major part of the background to the character, but very, very long and would take much time to read as well as write.  To say the least, Brennan serves his God with his whole self and will not pass over those that are hurt, in need, etc.  If you have any questions, or wish for detail, please ask. :)<BR>
