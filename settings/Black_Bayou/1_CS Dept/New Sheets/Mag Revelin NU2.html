System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

	This section of town is not one you want to be caught walking alone at night in; not one you want to be caught walking alone in at all. This is their district; the disillusioned (or never illusioned) deviants; those children never quite raised. They raised themselves on their own rules and made up names from books and plays; songs; Bibles, if the spirit so moved any of them to read. A subculture; a counterculture, maybe. A group of chthonians. They made up their own reality; their own system; their own eternity. There is a heirarchy, when the spirit so moves any of them to enforce it. School was unheard of; parents were absent in mind or in body. Scavengers; streetwalkers - minstrels who carry switchblades and have no qualms about drawing them. <BR>
	At eighteen years of age, Margaret Revelin has been here forever. It's likely she was born into it; her mother was born into it; it dates back and she has no idea who she is. A razor-sharp edge and a poison-laced interior; a case study in a sociology book. They have been sheltered from 'normal' life; never socialized - shadow-walkers with heavy boots and made-up slang; people who have no inkling about how they should work at being perceived. Dangerous, really. A dark mood. Like blasphemy in Cathedrals. With some of the West Side mixed in and bits and pieces of the traditional Cajun society, Andy Warhol-ish with Chopin accompanying. <BR>
	She has a sharp tongue, often slow to be used; commandeering, sometimes. The 42nd Street princess; a remnant of dusted butterfly wings. 'Broken'; 'cried'; 'weak' - these words are ones not allowed in this girl's vocabulary. Apologies and pleasantries; pleases and thank you's are not things you are likely to get from her. She's a projection of what this place can embody; veiled magic; a street nymph with a blunt tongue and little compassion put forth. Mag Revelin would turn herself into stone if she could, the untouched and tainted angel. She grew up like this, in this place; has never been outside of it. She's a little bit of sorrow and a little bit of that old bleakness; a rock once-upon-a-time cracked. None of this, however, would ever be allowed the luxury of dwelling on her face; in her eyes. Veritable chaos. They all think they know each other; it may be that no one knows her. She doesn't have those memories. <BR>
	She (sort of stated) was born in Voletta. Small and red-headed; ripples of waves. She has blue eyes; one wouldn't expect someone like her to have eyes remotely crystalline. She's underweight; somewhat stunted in growth; a heart-shaped face much too gentle for this sort of work. She's made of contradictions; of pallor and incense. Over-alls; hooded sweatshirts and bandanas over her hair; dyed feathers. No tattoos; no birthmarks. Scars, of course, are another story - she has those, on her right forearm and just below both kneecaps. She has small feet and long toes; small hands and long fingers; narrow shoulders. Feminine.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
