  These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
  <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).<BR>

  <BR>
  	<I>Her heart beat wildly inside her breast, as if the whole world were going to come bursting forth.  This was the key, the key to the locked room upstairs.  Ellie's elation was cut off abruptly as she realized that the key now lay in plain sight in a room she frequented nearly every day of her stay at Blackmoor Park.  Someone had intended for its discovery to fall to her.  But why now, after so many weeks of searching?  Indeed, months of searching, for Mrs. Walling the housekeeper had told of its disappearance on the eve of her uncle's departure, nearly eight months ago.<BR>
  	As Ellie ascended the great staircase to its narrower and more humble cousin, which seemed to creak and groan its warnings to her she held her breath for fear of breaking any spell which most certainly surrounded her.  The door, locked for as long as any could tell, now stood in front of her.  It beckoned, and as she inserted the key and heard the familiar sounds of springs and latches, a silent gasp fluttered in her soul.  Now was the mo-</I><BR>
  <BR>
  	"Aunt Maddie!  Aunt Maddie!"  Two voices shouted in unison as the double doors to her bedroom suite crashed against the walls.  A dark-haired boy, seven-years-old, and a nine-year-old girl paused briefly in their breathless pursuit as bright eyes searched for what they knew to be in the room.  The girl spotted her first, knowing where to look, and her pursuit was  renewed, little brother following.<BR>
  	Madison Langford sat in her window seat, propped up with pillows.  Her denim clad legs were crossed Indian-style, supporting her laptop computer, which she closed as her niece and nephew approached.  She smiled genuinely, not minding the interruption in the least, and set the computer aside to receive the hugs and greetings of her biggest fans.<BR>
  	"Hunter!  Dean!  Hey, you guys.  How was Florida?"<BR>
  	"It wath great, Aunt Maddie.  We got to go to Dithneyworld!!" Dean beamed up at his aunt.  In the front of his mouth, a big gaping hole where two front teeth had been knocked out during a street hockey game.<BR>
  	"Aunt Maddie!  Aunt Maddie?!"  Hunter was desperately tugging on the young writer's arm.  "Did Ellie ever find the key to the room upstairs?  Huh?  Did she?  Did she?"<BR>
  	Madison laughed and tapped the tip of her niece's nose with a fingertip before taking a hand of each child and leading them out of her room.  "Well, Hunter, Ellie was just about to open the door-"<BR>
  	"What's she going to find in there, Aunt Maddie?  Huh?"<BR>
  	"I don't know yet."  Looking down at her niece, she winked.  "Let's hope it's something good, eh?  Now where's that father of yours?"<BR>
  	"He'th in the living room with Grandma Evelyn."<BR>
  	"Okay, I know for a fact that Mrs. Harding has some of her special chocolate cake waiting just for you two.  Why don't you both go give her a big hug and kiss hello."  And with that, the children bolted for the kitchen, not needing any more encouragement.  Madison paused just outside the gilded archway to the sunken living room.<BR>
  	"Mother, please.  You have to understand that this deal would be good for everyone involved.  Even Father would have realized-"<BR>
  	"Your father built this company from the ground up.  He would not want to see it overrun by a bunch of yuppie morons.  Especially that Richard Garrison-"<BR>
  	"Business as usual, Jonathan?" Madison questioned with a sly smile and a wink to her mother as she breezed into the room and seated herself in her father's old over-stuffed chair.  Her brother, thirty-seven-year-old Jonathan Langford, stood near the brick fireplace, his hazel gaze shifting to his little sister.  Madison Langford, twenty, was the youngest of Matthew Langford's three children and the only girl.<BR>
  	"You're not helping any, Madison," Jonathan sighed, running a manicured hand over his thinning dark brown hair.  "I'm trying to discuss a very important merger with your mother-"<BR>
  	"Your mother too, Jonathan.  She gave birth to you as well, fortunately or unfortunately-"<BR>
  	"Madison."  Evelyn Langford warned her daughter, unable to check a small smile at her pale lips.  "That's enough.  Don't antagonize your brother."<BR>
  	"He started it," Madison said with a grin.<BR>
  	"Oh, give me a-"<BR>
  	"Both of you, knock it off."<BR>
  	"Sorry, Mother, won't happen again," Madison sang as she unfolded herself from her father's chair and went over to plant a kiss on her mother's cheek.<BR>
  	"That's a lie, and you know it," the widow mumbled, catching a glimpse of that gleam in her daughter's eye.<BR>
  	"I was just coming to tell you that I'm leaving to go pick up Derek at the airport"<BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  FOUR HOURS LATER<BR>
  <BR>
  	<I>Now was the moment she had been waiting for.  No matter what her cousins said, Ellie knew there was a treasure hidden in that room.  Why else would it be kept locked for so long, no one speaking of its contents or what it meant to the family?<BR>
  	Her hand trembled on the knob as it turned and the door creaked open with an aged sigh.-</I><BR>
  <BR>
  	"So, what or should I say who is little Miss Ellie Price going to find in the little locked attic room?"<BR>
  	Madison nearly jumped out of her skin as the whispered tones paraded over her shoulder and into her ear.  She snapped the laptop shut and turned to embrace her brother with a squeal.<BR>
  	Derek Langford, thirty, was four inches taller than his sister at 6'1" with a head full of dark curly brown hair.  He held her at arm's length, gazing down at her with a smile in his warm brown eyes.  He'd just spent two years in Europe, his only real contact with the family being his sister's letters and phone calls.  He'd spoken with his mother and brother over that time, but there was never the truth in their words as there was in Madison's.<BR>
  	"Precious," he began, using the nickname that only he and her father ever called her, "I have missed your face."  Giving her a quick kiss on the forehead before he turned around and gestured to someone behind him, he said, "I want you to meet Nathaniel Marlowe, a friend of mine.  I met him in London at a club and invited him to stay a while."<BR>
  	Madison's gaze went over her brother's shoulder to the lithe Brit who stood off to the side.  His dirty blonde hair hung into his blue eyes, as clear as her grandmother's crystal.  As her eyes, neither hazel nor brown but a curious mixture of both, drank him in, his gaze seemed to do the same thing.  She checked the little nervous flutter in her stomach.  Derek's homosexuality was not discussed freely among other members of the family, but she and Derek had had more conversations about men and dating than any other mother-daughter or sister-sister relationship she knew.  This guy was gorgeous - and came across an ocean with her brother - there was no way he was straight.  How disappointing.<BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  TWO WEEKS LATER<BR>
  <BR>
  	The cursor blinked at Madison.  Blink.  Blink.  Blink.  This was so aggravating!  What in God's name was in that little attic room?  Would Ellie Price only find her cousins' old toys and dolls, or would she find something of more value?  Just who exactly had put the key out for her to find?  The young Miss Langford struggled with these questions and more as she sat in a lounge chair out by the pool on a cool evening.  Her fingers tapped the keys, as if maybe they themselves would come up with the idea without the use of her feeble brain.<BR>
  	Two separate splashes caused her gaze to snap up and the surface of the calm pool to become decidedly disturbed.  Two forms, disfigured by the rippling water and colored lights, made their way stealthily to her end of the pool.  She closed the laptop and set it aside, stepping to the edge of the pool, hands on her hips as she waited patiently for the two mystery beings to surface.  The dark-haired one popped up first and she smiled at Derek as he turned to her with a grin.<BR>
  	"Hello, Precious."<BR>
  	"Hello, Derek," she said, crouching down and folding her arms about her knees.  "Nathaniel," she nodded to him as he surfaced.<BR>
  	"Nate, please," he insisted, looking up at her with a half-smile.<BR>
  	"Nate.  I was sure I was the only one in the house still up and about," she resumed, addressing herself to her brother.<BR>
  	"Well, you were wrong.  Join us for a swim, oh sister dear?"<BR>
  	"No, I'm not dressed for swimming," she began, gesturing to her red tank top and plaid boxer shorts, "besides, it looks like-"<BR>
  	Before she could go any further, she was pulled into the pool by two pairs of hands, her brother and Nate having exchanged a mischievous look only seconds before.  She surfaced coughing, and trying to keep the smile from her face as she splashed at the two men.<BR>
  	"Well, now it seems you have no choice," her brother quipped.<BR>
  <BR>
  	"So, what's in the attic?" Nate questioned, looking up from the laptop.  He sat at the end of Madison's lounge chair.  She sat back, one knee drawn up, the other leg extended behind him.<BR>
  	Her shoulders tilted in a shrug.  "I don't know.  I haven't really decided yet."<BR>
  	Nate wrapped an arm around her leg and rested his chin on top of her knee with a grin.  "Any ideas?"<BR>
  	Madison's heart fluttered briefly.  Many of Derek's former beaus had engaged in flirtations with her, but somehow this was different... and cruel, both to herself and her brother.  She shrugged nonchalantly and stood up from the lounge, snatching the comp from Nate's hands.  "Haven't had any inspiration yet."  She walked away from him, padding away on bare feet towards the house.  "G'nite, Derek," she called to her brother as she passed the hot tub.<BR>
  <BR>
  	Madison sat at her window seat, gazing at the stars, when she heard a knock at her door.  "Come in," she called.<BR>
  	"I just came to say good night," Nate said softly as his eyes scanned the room before finally alighting on her.  He stepped into the room, leaning back onto the door as it clicked shut.<BR>
  	She just gazed at him coolly from across the room.  "Good night."<BR>
  	He frowned slightly.  "Can I ask you a question, Madison?"<BR>
  	"Sure, why not?" she shrugged.<BR>
  	"Have I said or done anything to offend you in any way?  I've been getting some mixed signals from you-"<BR>
  	"Mixed signals from me?!" she interrupted, standing from her seat.<BR>
  	"Yes," he insisted, stepping towards her.  "Ever since I've arrived you've been alternately flirting with me and avoiding me.  I don't get it."<BR>
  	A cloud of confusion swept past her autumnal gaze.  "Listen, I don't know what kind of game you're trying to play, but I want no part of it, and you can leave my brother out of it-"<BR>
  	"Your brother?" He paused a moment and then choked on a laugh.  "Oh God.  You don't think that I...  that he and I..." his words were lost to laughter.<BR>
  	"Oh God," she whispered, covering her face with her hands as a blush slowly crept up her cheeks.<BR>
  	He closed the gap between them and pulled her hands down from her face.  "You thought I was another one of your brother's boyfriends?"<BR>
  	"Well, what was I supposed to think?  He said he met you at a club, and you came across an entire ocean to stay at his house-"<BR>
  	"Derek offered, and I'd never been to the States before.  Besides," he added, looking down at her, "I wanted to meet his kid sister.  You know, he couldn't stop talking about you."<BR>
  	"Oh God," she mumbled.<BR>
  	He laughed again softly and tugged on her hands, pulling her closer to him.  She kept her gaze averted, the heat still rising on her face.  He bowed his head slightly, pressing his lips to the top of her head.  His hands ran up her bare arms to her shoulders and he lowered his chin until they were cheek to cheek.  He smiled softly as he felt the warmth of her skin.<BR>
  	She closed her eyes as his cheek slid along next to hers.  His breath felt cool on her skin as it whispered across her ear.  He tilted his head slightly until their lips brushed.  A quiet sigh escaped her parted lips in the moments before he kissed her fully.<BR>
  <BR>
  THE NEXT MORNING<BR>
  <BR>
  	"Hey, Derek, have you seen Nate this morning?" Madison queried as she walked into the dining room in only her cotton robe and flip-flops.  She had awakened not long before alone in her bed and wondered at the disappearance of the Englishman.<BR>
  	"Huh?" Derek mumbled around a mouthful of eggs, his gaze rolling up to his sister.  "Oh," he resumed, swallowing quickly, "he left a couple of hours ago.  Said he had a flight to catch."<BR>
  	"Flight to catch?" She stopped dead in her tracks, focusing hard on her brother.<BR>
  	"Yeah, he had to get back to the fam.  Man," he sighed, forking in another mouthful of eggs, "I'm gonna miss that little tart around here.  Too bad he's married, I would've given him the time of his life."  Derek laughed and went back to his breakfast.<BR>
  	"Derek!  Oh God... oh God..." she sank into a chair and folded her arms on the table before letting her forehead fall and bounce a couple of times.  "No wonder I can't have a normal boyfriend..." she mumbled, "every relationship around me is dysfunctional!"<BR>
  <BR>
  EPILOGUE<BR>
