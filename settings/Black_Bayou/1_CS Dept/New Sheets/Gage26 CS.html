 The Governor, The Mayor, The District Attorney, Circuit Court Judges, even small town civic leaders. They've built their dreams on the backs of the citizenry, which ironically have brought them to office.  Now they scheme and plot with each other, against each other, in the never-ending battle of holier than thou.  Who will rise to the surface?  Who will fall gracefully?  Who will wind up at the bottom of the Gulf in cement shoes?  Time will tell.  Since this occupation is limited to a small number of individuals, you must first send a request to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Politico Occupation Request">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#030000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8> before purchasing this occupation.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#030000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

       <B>Effect/Description: </B> The werewolves' olfactory senses are very sensitive, sometimes to the point where they pick up on the presence of supernatural beings.  They will instantly know what the individual's breed is if they have the lore.  The individual must IM the werewolf's player with the truth if the werewolf wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the Demon.<BR>

        May 2nd 1976, the lower bottoms of London, in the tiny flat on the corner.  John and Louise Blade have had there only child...his name is Gage Blade.  Gage was a fighter right from the start he was born w/ Pnemonia but fought it off.  He was born on the side of London thats embelished w/ poverty and lacks the usual luster of what London is idealy thought of.  He was born w/in walking distance of the Thames River.  Gage was raised with all the manors and proper upbringing of a boy in King Arthurs time.  His parents although they could hardly afford it, enrolled teenage Gage in a martial arts class.  Gage soon excelled and although he was almost 17 Gage was better than almost everyone.  Another thing little Gage understood would be the vast revolution electronics and computers would bring around.  He started a tiny store that quickly grew to Blade Enterprises, but unknown to him that fame would bring about his downfall.   <BR>
       <BR>
       Nory McKnight, a quite girl raised in the prim and proper ways of a princess.  She came to work at Gage enterprises as a secritary.  Gage soon noticed the attractive young Nory, and began to lavish her with gifts.  They began a secret relationship that soon became more...how shall we say?  physical.  All went well for the couple until they broke up.  Nory charged Gage with sexual harrasment and he was tried and convicted.  Gage fell from grace like Lucifer fell to hell.  Gage took the last of his money and flew to America.  He was soon attracted by the party atmosphere of New Orleans, but quickly changed his destonation to Isle Volleta.  Once there he settled down and invested the rest of his money in stocks.  He bought stock in Microsoft and AOL as well as some of the other high priced stocks.  He also sold Blade Enterprise for a sizable sum of money.  He has lived in Isle Volleta since 1995.  He got married to Zoe Knight and had 2 children Alex and Kelly.  He joined the small group of Vampires the Knight family.  He stayed with the family for about a year then his wife killed herself.  He has since left the family to form his own pack with his long time friend and lover Nisa Knight. Gage is now in the fold for Mayor of Isle Voletta.<BR>
