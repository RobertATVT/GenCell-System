<B>Adrenaline</B> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Luck</B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Gift</B> - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

Appearance (clothes, etc.):</B> Somewhat tall and gaunt in appearance, his motions have been slowed to a southern laziness to compensate. Eyes are ovalish, lifting up at the outer corners lending an Asiatic instcrutiblity as well as Nordic distance to his demeanor. The hair falling in a ragged pageboy around his chin is the classic red - orange - with streaks of true red threading through it like firelight. Jeans in varying stages of raggedness are normal along with various button down shirts.<B><BR>

</B>Roman Slavotski lead his small family from one gaming palace to another for nineteen years. His wife didn't make it the whole way, dying when their only son was barely nine years old. Zadiel, when he thinks of her, remembers only a tiny, sad doll that went through the motions of motherhood, religion and marriage. She left only her name to her son in the end. Her husband never kept the promise to raise him in her faith. Roman taught his son everything, keeping them on the road, and away from authorities that would take the frail boy from his father to put him through school. As a result, when Zadiel left his father's company nearly two years ago, he only had the reading, writing and math skills to handle daily life. He strangled the roving desire long enough to learn more, landing a GED. Then it was on the road, losing contact with his father mostly until a year ago. He was tracked down by police to claim what was left of his father's belongings, after Roman was shot for cheating in a private game. He turned from his western trek to head down into Georgia, claiming the possessions. He arranged for the burial with money won in a similar game, without the cheating. Then he was on the road again, trying to part with the last fading memories of childhood. His wandering path lead him into Voletta, with little money left to spare.<BR>
