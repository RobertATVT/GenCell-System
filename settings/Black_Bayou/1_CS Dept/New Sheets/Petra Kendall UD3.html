  <B>Description:</B> The ability to compose and play music is not the easiest form of employment, but can certainly be satisfying to the individual.  The music skill itself is a rather broad skill, but musicians the world over have learned multitudes of instruments and most can play more than one.  In other words, if you own the Musician Occupation you do not have a limit on your instrument choice.  If you do not have this Occupation, you must choose one style of musical talent to strive for - writer or musician.  In parenthesis next to your Music Skill, list which type of music talent you are as well as what instrument you use, or the word 'writer'.  Success of a writing roll allows the character to write a musical piece that others enjoy and want to listen to.  Successfully making a play roll represents the characters ability to perform a musical composition well by utilizing voice or more mechanical instrument, not making mistakes, and generally impressing those who listen.<BR>

  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
  animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

  System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

  System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

  System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the Lamia is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the Lamia attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> This is the truest measure of a Lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The Lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the Lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the Lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The Lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The Lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The Lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the Lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way, however.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Petra Kendall is 4'6" and weighs 70 pounds.  She is slim, bird-boned, frail of build, and weak of constitution.  Her eyes are a pale peridot green, with amber flecks, and her knee-length hair is the color of the dawn, a rosy reddish-gold.  The few outfits she owns from her father are cast-off, second-hand jeans and t-shirts, sweaters in winter--stained, badly frayed, far out of style.  Thin, fading scars mar her silken porcelain skin, and over a period of eighteen years, she has endured having almost every major bone in her body broken, many of them more than once.  Despite that, she has healed well, and when cleaned up, even in cast-off clothes, she is beautiful enough--in a tiny, birdlike way--to take a person's breath away.  Slightly tilted eyes frame a straight, slender nose; full rosebud lips are turned down with sorrow or fear far more often than uptilted in a joyous smile.  High cheekbones and a narrow, foxlike chin complete the delicate features, and her limbs and hands are thin and waiflike.  Her figure is svelte, a far cry from the voluptuous forms of those such as Anna Nicole Smith or Pamela Lee Anderson, but she is undeniably feminine, a waifish child-woman of the sort that misogynistic sociopaths consider the perfect victim.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Her growth stunted and her frail body habitually weak from poor nutrition and lack of food as she was growing up, she survived such a life only because of a combination of luck and the fact that, just when such beatings seemed enough to kill her, something or someone would intervene.  Despite the visible bruises on her face and hands, the casts on broken arms or legs, Petra slipped through the cracks of an overburdened Social Services Agency which should have taken her away from her father many years ago.  <B><I><BR>
   </B></I>	Petra's one chance for escape came during one of her father's many bouts of drunkenness.  After she had done her chores for the evening, he customarily locked her in the closet where she had spent the first eighteen years of her life.  That closet, with its pallet on the floor and single sheet, with no light and no pillow, was her only home, and she had spent her entire life there.  School was only a dream to her; she had never been in a car, or to church, or to a park; she had not even been toilet-trained until she was eight years old, and she could not write or read, not even her own name.  She returned to her closet, curling up to go to sleep, and her father came storming into the kitchen with a glass he had been drinking beer out of which she had not washed.  Forbidden by her father since she was old enough to understand speech that she was forbidden to go into the living room--where he sat drinking and watching TV, which she had never seen--she had been unable to collect the glass.  For this Catch-22, he began to beat her.  Before he could get very far, however, he passed out.  Bruised and bleeding, Petra gathered her few meager belongings and fled, trying to put as much distance between herself and her father, as he would certainly seek her out once he woke.<BR>
   	Petra has been on the road since then, not quite a runaway, but homeless, moving from place to place, certain her father is still looking for her--as he is.  Having never had any education at all, there are very few businesses, even fast-food places, that will hire her, and so she works mostly in orchards and fields with migrant laborers, making barely enough to keep from starving, fending off the advances of strangers, and always moving on before too much time has passed, to make sure her father isn't too close behind.  In the last two years, she has taught herself to read and write, and learned a love of music that has helped to keep most of her sanity intact.  <BR>
   	And now her wandering travels have brought her to Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
