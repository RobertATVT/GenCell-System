</B>Government agents have a number of different origins.  From the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Central Intelligence Agency to the highly secret National Security Agency.  These organizations are deeply rooted with sub-organizations so clouded in secrecy that they often don't recognize each other in the field.  All Player Character government agents begin as a low ranking field agent for whichever agency they belong to.  Also, you never know how many ex-agents there are lurking in the shadows...just what is their angle?<BR>

<B>Advantage:</B> Field agents are trained to hit the targets they take aim at, and will only do so if the situation meets the requirements of their training.  All agents gain +3 to their Sure Shot skill and their jurisdiction overrides any local law enforcement.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

System/Duration: </B> NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This spell enables the Lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Lamia Animal Form Request">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> and for a listing of the authorized animal forms: <A HREF="aol://4344:1192.lanimal.9394883.595601422">Lamia Animal Forms</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a Lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the Lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes fifteen minutes to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> When this spell is successfully cast, the Lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the Lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a fifteen minutes to cast and the Lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will force the Lamia to start over a gain.  The Lamia must role-play the fifteen minute casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
System/Duration: </B> NA/NA / Instant; takes 15 minutes to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a Lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 15 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each quarter-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The Lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the Lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the Lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 Breed: Lamia<BR>
 Age and/or birth date: 31 years old<BR>
 Eye Color: Black<BR>
 Hair: Black<BR>
 Height/weight: 5'11" 160 lbs.<BR>
 Occupation: Undercover agent for Mi6, currently on Long Term Sabbatical<BR>
 Equipment/weapons: lockpicking gear, a grappling hook, and a Colt .40 automatic, plated in silver, given to him when he began his sabbatical<BR>
 Appearance (clothes, etc.): Just shy of six feet, this guy definately gives you the impression of being taller. His appearance is best termed as ageless, as no one has yet to correctly guess his age on sight, and a certain angularness to his features and a slight point to his ears betray genetics that can't be explained well. In the (relatively) oppresive heat of Lousiana, he is usually found in denim or khaki shorts and a Tshirt rooting on one English team or another, particularly Manchester United. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B></I><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I>Blackthorne Jhelian Tahalshia was born in 1968 in Manchester, England. Though anyone in the Tahalshian family line is far from "normal", Black managed a relatively simple life up until the end of his adolescence. It was about this time he managed to gain control of his magic, as a Druid, one of the oldest sorts of spellcasters. But throwing spells and chasing kids in robes away from stone circles doesn't pay the bills, unless you manage to tackle one of the kids and rob him. To this end, Blackthorne managed to gain employment in the Ministry Of Intelligence, specfically, keeping an eye on the IRA and the terroristic activities associated with them. Normal is not the word for a Druid working undercover for his government, but he certainly tried for it, settling down and staying out of the line of fire as much as possible most of the time. He did get into a serious, long term relationship, but when it was discovered he was sterile, things gradually fell apart, and Blackthorne gave up the dream of normalcy and a family to live a bachelors life, a bit like another British secret agent we won't speak of here. After getting caught in a bomb blast he failed to stop in a shopping mall in Manchester, Blackthorne went on a "Long Term Sabbatical", as he calls it. With a modest pension, and the silver plated .40 automatic he recieved several years prior, he has since roamed Europe being a modern Casanova sort, until recently when he became quite smitten with Chanson Du Geste, the Squealer Reporter. After getting blown off rather abruptly, he has stuck around simply to stay out of the Troubles, but is growing closer to another woman. He is currently in residence in Tahalshia Manor, with all the usual mob that inhabits that not-quite-normal home.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></I><BR>
