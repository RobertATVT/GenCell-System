<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly yellow fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

To this end she dresses in delicate dresses of the finest material, usually blues and soft colors to compliment her fair coloring.  Her hair she keeps in tight ringlets that frame her face and assist in creating the illusion of the fragile doll she would have others believe her to be.  This is, however, not the case for amidst the folds of her dress she keeps concealed a small derringer to dissuade any who might think to take advantage of a lone child.  Additionally, to avoid the difficulties encountered by her appearance, Chrysa carries a number of articles she might use as identification and proof of her true age.  Among these are a copy of her birth certificate, a state ID that she has updated during each move, three credit cards, a medical report explaining her condition and an official court document recognizing her as an adult (she is 25) in the country of the united states.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <BR>
</B></I>	Nine hundred and sixty-seven years before the immaculate conception of Christ the Egyptian society thrived like no other; achieving wonders in the way of medicines and magic unrivaled before or since.  In this time, the Egyptian hierarchy achieved a level of decadence rivaling that of the Roman empire itself ... nothing was denied the rulers of this vast civilization, these men and women said to be gods in mortal guise.   A misconception perpetuated by the priests themselves for which they enjoyed a level of freedom second only to their pharaoh.  <BR>
	Among these elite there existed a priest by the name of Ka'Sa Ri'thetope. Though powerful man and physician, a mortal he was not; for he had been blessed by the gods with the eternal power of the unliving.  Or at least this was the belief held by his fevered mind ... a mind that was shattered inexorably when he was brought across by his own pharaoh.  Quite madd and hungry for power, Ri'thetope became obsessed with the concept of the living god and set into motion a chain of events that would lead to his eventual demise.  <BR>
	For fifteen years he sought, among mortal baern, the one who would help him see the fruition of his prophecy ... a vision he believed given by the deities themselves of the one true god of flesh, a god who he would nurture and control from the shadows.  It was then, that he found Kira'sin An'rah.<BR>
	Born to a common servant it was believed from the moment of her birth that the child had indeed been blessed by the gods, for rather than the raven hue of her mother this fledgling possessed hair of spun fire and gold .. with eyes the color of the deepest heavens.  <BR>
	Covetous of the child from the moment of birth, the priest bade his time until the hour of its weaning and snatched the infant from her mother's arms as the woman herself he had put to death.  <BR>
	The child was everything that Ri'thetope could have desired.  A savant from the moment it learned to understand the world around it, the fledgling devoured all the knowledge the priest offered with an unquenchable thirst.  A thirst that caused her patron great fear for his ability to control her when the years progressed.  So it was that the cleric, in desperation, transformed the girl into a state of eternal life at the age of five years.  <BR>
	As time progressed, so did the protégées understandings of the foul secrets offered her by the man she had come to understand as her master.  Kept eternally in his sway by her physical constraints and the assurances that she could not hope to survive on her own, the child was tutored ceaselessly for the role she would be asked to play.<BR>
	As was stated, however, the priestly mentors faculties were of a questionable stability in the beginning days of his unlife ... and time was no balm for such degradation.  In his maddness the priest was wont to ramble on about his impending success ... ramblings that eventually reached the ears of the pharaoh himself.  <BR>
	Enraged by this betrayal, that his own child would attempt to usurp his power, the Egyptian king struck the first and final blow in this long impending conflict ... declaring Ri'thetope a demon and betrayer ... the punishment, death by exposure to the burning desert sun.  The child, however, was never discovered; hidden within the secret confines of a chamber specially designed for her safety ... forced to depart on her own with the fall of night.  Seeking shelter in the nearest city, the child found her powers offered her the ability to survive .. something that had been denied her thus far.<BR>
	As the years progressed the child traveled between city and country, across seas and through war stricken lands ... everywhere she traveled her mark was left, though her true goal was to find rumored magics that would allow her to shed the childish form she had been cursed with and truly experience the gifts offered by immortality.  This was never to be, however, for along her search she drew the attentions of those ancients among her people ... those who could not see past her physical form and understand the tragedy or her creation ... those who would serve to be her destruction in the year 1874 A.D, on the eve of the realization of her dream.<BR>
<BR>
	But time progresses and in time even shadows forget the events of their past.  So it was that a hundred years would pass without thought of the child vampire and her aspirations.  The world would continue to progress, the legions of the undead would make their mark in history and a child with hair of fire and gold would be born in a Chicago hospital on the eve of St. George's day.  <BR>
	Now it is said that spirits never die, that although our bodies may rot and decay in the earth our souls are free to wander and should the stars decree even gain a second chance at redemption. <BR>
	If later asked, Chrysa D'Marou might say this is what happened on the day of her birth.  Certainly it would be a tale more interesting than that told by the numerous psychologists whose aid she was forced to seek during those years spent in a nameless orphanage.  Chrysa would tell of the spirit of a long dead vampire ... of her desire for redemption, for a second chance at life.  That opportunity was to be mocked, however, for even as this lovely child began to mature ... as she learned to read at that age of three and play the violin at five, tragedy would descend upon the joint spirits of these two women.  For Kira'sin it would be the reemergence of an ancient curse, for Chrysa the occurrence that would damn her soul; for at the age of five the young woman was diagnosed with a rare ailment, a corruption of the genetic code that would cause her apparent aging to cease.<BR>
	Having been born to a couple never truly emerged from the drug induced miasma of the sixties and whose maturity was not up to the task of raising a child so cursed, Chrysa was relegated to the care of an orphanage; from which her delusions insured she would never find a stable home.  Indeed it was only under the threat of being institutionalized that the aging woman finally relented and "admitted" that her wild fantasies where nothing more than that.  <BR>
	When she was finally released from the custody of that lonely children's home, the young woman found that her appearance was not an obstacle easily overcome.  Often she would be tormented or mocked by society do to a condition they could not hope to understand ... while at night she would dream of ancient places and events never recorded in history ... though real or imagined she could not know.  Eventually she found her way into film where she portrayed children in sensitive or intense motion pictures where her maturity level became an important commodity.  It was never enough, however, there was something eternally missing in her life, something she could not localize ... something that drove her on .. in search of her soul, her identity.  <BR>
	Such is when she became ensnared by the occult.  Among these people she found that she was not judged by her perceived deformities but celebrated for her talents and her unique nature.  Her questions of identity were encouraged and soon she became an avid member of these societies; committing many an atrocity in the name of freedom.  Eventually, however, the corruption of her compatriots reached home as those she trusted turned on her in hopes of gaining the acceptance of their unnamed gods and she was forced to flee.<BR>
	Since that time she has continued her research into the occult, though her new understanding that no mortal can possess the understanding and loyalty she seeks has led her to secretive worship away from the prying eyes of society.  And it is this that has drawn her to the town of Voletta ... armed with questions of her own existence and shadowy half truths of which she can only suspect the origin.  <BR>
	Having discovered talent as an author, Chrysa makes her living as a freelance writer, specializing in studies of the supernatural and the unexplained; a profession that takes her anywhere she might wish to travel in the modern world.  <BR>
