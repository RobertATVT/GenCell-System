<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

	Franz was usually good at whatever he did. He was particularly good at hurting people. A fiendish temper and not knowing what to do with it he searched for the un-doer of his parents. Traveling to America from his home in Germany after giving up a life as an underground street fighter his life was one big bet and he has a battle scar from every bet mand on his head. He's an easy person to get along with. Although he is known for making a few paitings with the victem's face as his canvas if provoked. <BR>
<BR>
	Franz grew up as a fighter, and remains as a fighter. His father and uncle taught him everything he knows about his craft. Franz is a calm person most of the time, but if his temper does flair he usually has little control. He started making money on petty street fights against neighborhood children, he realized, by crusing them all, he should look into this as a professions. Thats exactly what he did. Franz fought the underground for 15 years, he started when he was 17. 32 now he's ready to settle down and take his money to America and star repairing the life he left, and healing the scar he created.<BR>
	<BR>
	His manager arraged an apartment for him from a friend in America. Franz would be staying in Voletta. He was excited, with his parents recently killed he thought he'd find peace in this place. Him going to Voletta was no mistake, infact he wanted to go there. Seems the murderer of his parents dropped a piece of paper; it had a phone number on it with the area code of Voletta on it. Franz knew he would have to find his parents' killer. Then his plans at peace would eventually fall into place.<BR>
