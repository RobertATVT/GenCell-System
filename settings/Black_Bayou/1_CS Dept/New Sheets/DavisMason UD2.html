<B><I>Hi, your CS was already approved earlier this month, but we have a little problem here.  Your list of role-playing XP includes many days in the period since your last update.  Now I know you might play alot, but there is proof (in the form of logs) that you haven't quite earned that many XP over the period.  There are logs for days like <BR>
</B></I>Feb:<BR>
19, 20, 26<BR>
Mar:<BR>
1, 2, 10, 12, 20, 21, 27, 28<BR>
Apr:<BR>
2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11<B><I><BR>
where you did not earn an XP, that's at least 17 days of the period claimed.<BR>
<BR>
If it comes up again that you are not handling XP carefully we will have little choice but to take them away.  And if it continues after that we will take away more then the XP in question, this is your first and last warning on the subject.  <BR>
<BR>
Below you will find a copy of your CS as approved 2/25/00, it is temporarily you active CS until you correct the XP on your CS originally approved on 4/12/00, but is now pulled.  Please correct your XP record and resubmit the CS, you can add any XP you have earned since you last submitted the CS too, they will be checked of course.  :-)<BR>

  The men and women in blue, justice over all, highly trained and fully equipped to handle every crisis.  Well, almost any crisis. The modern day heroes.  Anyone can be an ex-officer, but only those that get hired by the Sheriffs Department are active officers in-character.<BR>

  <B>Advantage:</B>   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

  <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

        Sam Davis was born and raised in Los Angeles, or rather a small city to the<BR>
        Northeast of downtown LA called Pasadena.  A basic slum at the time, it<BR>
        quickly grew up into a bustling and beautiful city, long after Sam reached<BR>
        adulthood.<BR>
          <BR>
          Sam spent most of his childhood in trouble.  He was a fairly rebellious<BR>
        child, enjoying causing trouble and harrassing the local police force.  He<BR>
        was often taken, as a juvenile, to the police station.  When he got a<BR>
        computer, at the age of fifteen, he spent most of his time trying to hack<BR>
        into local computer systems.<BR>
          <BR>
          When he turned seventeen, he made his mother go with him and sign the<BR>
        papers so he could enlist in the United States Marine Corps.  He was<BR>
       assigned infantry, hoping eventually for Force Recon, but was transferred to a<BR>
        Military police unit.  He became very involved in the police unit, and, upon<BR>
        discharge, applied at the LAPD Academy.  After graduation, he was hired<BR>
        directly into the LAPD, Southwestern Division, deep in the heart of South<BR>
        Central, intending to go back to the Pasadena PD after five years on the<BR>
        force, when he would be a veteran.  After a year on the force, he left his<BR>
        Boot stage, and became a P-II, a full patrol officer.  Due to his hard work<BR>
        and dedication, two years later he was promoted to a P-III, authorized to<BR>
        train Boot's out of the Academy on the force.  Another year on the force,<BR>
       and the department sent him to become a DRE, or Drug Recognition Expert.  After<BR>
        four years of dedication, Sam couldn't contemplate going to another<BR>
        department, so was intending to stay on the LAPD until retirement or death.<BR>
          <BR>
          In May of 1997, however,  his mother moved to Louisana and became very ill.<BR>
        Davis moved to Louisiana to join and help her, feeling it his responsibility<BR>
        after what he had put her through as a child.  Once there, he applied for<BR>
         the Isla Voletta PD. <BR>
         <BR>
         After some time in the Voletta PD, the local department was shut down to<BR>
       form one Law Enforcement Agency, and Davis was transferred to the Sheriff's<BR>
       Department, under the supervision of Sheriff Cameron Slygar. He was appointed<BR>
       Senior Deputy-in-charge and assigned not only to street patrol, but new hire<BR>
       applicants. Later, promoted to Chief Deputy, he acted as the assistant<BR>
       Sheriff.<BR>
       <BR>
       Davis soon thereafter changed his name from Sam Richard Davis to Davis<BR>
       Mason and, upon the resignation of Sheriff Slygar, gained the rank of Sheriff in the Voletta Parish Sheriff's Department<BR>
