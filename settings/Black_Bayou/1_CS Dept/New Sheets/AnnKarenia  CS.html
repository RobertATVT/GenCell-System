<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B><I>The Gift </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Annabelle has light skin from so many spending the cold summers and winters of Germany and Russia indoors.  Wearing light makeup and her golden hair being cropped short about to her ears.  Annabelle wears semi-casual clothes.  Her pants, tied by a drawstring, are dark and loose, swaying whenever she moves.  A silk blouse adorns her chest, hiding within it her muscles from years of training in the fighting arts.  Her personality is somewhat secluded, she will often put on a bit of a psedo-person should someone get too nosey for her liking.  Rarely she will open herself up completely, letting them know of her distraught past.  At first glance she would seem as a person that just maybe had a semi-bad day, the facial expression locked off from almost everyone.  When she does talk it is in a happy tone, and heavily accented with mainly German but occasionally it will be mixed with German; but you could definitely tell she wasn't born and raised in the United States just by speaking to her.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

Background:	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#8000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Annabelle grew up in Moscow, Russia only a small part of her life, but her family had close ties into the Russian Mafia and prospered because of it.  Annabelle had a very close tie with her father and older brother.  Her brother protected her throughout her life.  In 1979 when Annabelle was only six her father was found brutally murdered.  It was a disaster that would continue to haunt her and her family for years to come.  Her family still, even without her father, had money; the money of her mother's family and some from savings.  Vladimir (who now was taking care of most family matters), her brother, watched as the communist party was starting to give-way around 1980-81; transferring all money to Swiss accounts for financial safety he then turned to the family.  They had to leave so late one night in December 1980 they hurried onto a train and left the USSR to East Germany.  East Germany was still in communist hands and Annabelle's family was well known with the communists there and so were well off for now.  Annabelle continued to study as much as she could in the restricted atmosphere of East Germany.  Wanting to learn more things and go to a university somewhere she slipped away in 1987 after months of careful preparations and planning to West Germany.  Not many people made it across the wall alive and she took the chance for a better life.  Leaving a note with Vlad she took some money and just left.  Her bother, caring for her no matter what, sent her money once a month to live on and save Incas she may need it sometime.  Taking what money she had she started to attend a local school, learning about as much as she could.  When the wall fell in 1989, Annabelle went to East Germany to find Vlad or her mother.  Upon reaching the house that she once lived in she found both her brother and mother dead from poisoning.  Upon reading the letter of apology and good-bye she learned that her brother had poisoned himself after poisoning their mother.  He said that with the fall of Communism he didn't want to live anymore, he believed that strongly in it.  On a separate card two Swiss accounts were given each containing two million dollars.  Slipping the card into her pocket she lit a cigarette and dropped it onto the carpet igniting it into flames.  Calmly Annabelle walked out looking back to the growing flames in the window.  Her face was hardened and showed little if no emotion about the entire incident.  She went back and finished the German equivalent of high school and then started to attend the University of Berlin.  She took various subjects just wanting to learn whatever she could.  Most of her late teens and early twenties were sad ones often going back to where the old house in Eastern Germany once stood.  Sometimes when Russia wasn't in too much turmoil she went and visited her father's grave at St. Peter's Cathedral.  Annabelle took little money out of the accounts in Switzerland.  Around 1997 she moved to New York, working a bit on the runway modeling clothes to keep up the look of a struggling woman in New York.  She didn't want people to know the past that was still vivid in her mind.  Rarely opening up to anyone she lived a bit of a secluded life from almost everyone.  Wanting to see more of the country she went to New Orleans for Mardi Gras in 1999.  Hearing a bit about an Isle Voletta not that far from here she bought a jeep to drive there and headed on out...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
