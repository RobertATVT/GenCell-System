Just a note, you might want to leave off old XP. It's a little confusing to pull what XP are relevant from a record that just keeps tagging them on. :) Also, you left off the four unused XP from your last UD. I've added these in for you.<BR>

Congratulations! Save this approved sheet for your records.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

5'11, all 135 lbs of her weight solid muscle from years of daily physical exercise. Far from looking like a buffed out bodybuilder though, her form is very lean and athletic. Her hair is a deep auburn, which in sunlight changes to a firey red - thick, straight, and cut in long layers around her face to a few inches below her shoulders. Eyes of sparkling grey peer out beneath her long bangs, a somewhat unusual shade for a redhead. They lighten and darken with her mood, from an almost silver cast when she's laughing, to the angry darkness of thunderclouds. This odd coloring, along with delicate features and high cheekbones, lends her something of an exotic beauty. Along her right thigh runs a tattoo of a "tribal" design surrounded by flames...a holdover from her days on the streets. Her dress is usually very professional during the day, at night more casual but still in high fashion.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Ceile Nessa Malley was born on Halloween, 1971. She was the second child of Jack and Cindy, her brother Derek having arrived two ears earlier. The Malleys lived just outside of Denver, and were poor - extremely so. Ceile's father Jack worked odd jobs that he got through temp agencies - the type where contractors and the like could hire cheap labor for a day. More precisely, he worked these jobs only when he felt like it, or when Cindy had finally screamed at him enough. Most of his time was spent hanging out with his buddies on street corners, complaining about their wives and kids, and generally watching the world move on without them. Cindy was at least employed on a regular basis as a waitress in one of the neighborhood's seedier bars. But whether she was sober enough to do her job on any given night was another matter. A raging alcoholic, she would often neglect the children entirely in favor of a bottle and sometimes, when the liquor brought out her temper, would beat the children for any minor infraction. When old enough, Ceile and Derek were enrolled in school, but their parents' interest in education stopped there. More often than not the kids were left to get to school on their own, and it was very clear that Jack and Cindy couldn't have cared less whether they went or not. From early on, Derek's attendance was sporadic at best. He started skipping class to waste time with his dad, and eventually found every dropout's dream of fast money - earned by dealing drugs and other crimes. Ceile, however, quickly caught on to the idea that an education was the first step to a better life. And having been left almost completely on her own since just after learning to walk, a better life was all she could dream of. So she threw herself into school, convinced it was her only ticket out of her world of neglect and poverty. Her parents gave no support to her endeavors, which was no surprise. But Derek for some reason seemed mortally offended by her quest for knowledge. He and the endless stream of thug friends he brought home would torment her mercilessly - ripping up her books and homework, and even going so far as to beat her up. When her parents made no move to stop him Ceile decided she had finally had enough and left home. She was all of 12 years old. Ceile moved from place to place, staying at her school mates' houses when she could, but just as often taking whatever shelter she could find on the streets. Not surprisingly this life made her very tough both mentally and physically. As soon as she was old enough she got a job stocking in a grocery store. And as always, she stayed in school, soaking up as much knowledge as she could on every available subject. After graduating from high school she got a second job and eventually saved enough money to rent a cheap studio apartment and enroll at the University of Denver as a business major. After several years of study, while still working full time, she emerged a college graduate. Ready to take on the world, her determined ambition soon landed her a job with a large advertising firm. Never satisfied with half a victory, she fought her way up the company ladder, and finally felt she was at least starting to achieve her goal of total success. But before long her past came back to haunt her. Lured by her executive status and the money that came with it her father and brother suddenly wanted to be a family again. Ceile soundly rejected them, hoping they would rake the hint and leave her in peace. But when their begging turned to threats she knew she had to move on once again. She ended up moving to New Orleans, staying with a friend from college until she could find a job and a place of her own. Unfortunately Jack and Derek were able to track her down again, having somehow gotten her new address from an ex-coworker. Thanks to a few threatening phone calls she had advance warning of their coming and enough time to pack up again, heading for a small town in the Louisiana bayou...Isle Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
