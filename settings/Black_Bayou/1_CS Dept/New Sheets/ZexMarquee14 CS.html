									<B>Occupation</B><BR>
<BR>
Federal Law Enforcement<BR>
Generation Cost: 40 / Experience Cost: 120<BR>
Government agents have a number of different origins.  From the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Central Intelligence Agency to the highly secret National Security Agency.  These organizations are deeply rooted with sub-organizations so clouded in secrecy that they often don't recognize each other in the field.  All Player Character government agents begin as a low ranking field agent for whichever agency they belong to.  Also, you never know how many ex-agents there are lurking in the shadows...just what is their angle?<BR>

Advantage: Field agents are trained to hit the targets they take aim at, and will only do so if the situation meets the requirements of their training.  All agents gain +3 to their Sure Shot skill and their jurisdiction overrides any local law enforcement.<BR>

								<B>Special Abilities</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Adrenaline - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<BR>
Luck - 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
The Gift - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

Appearance (clothes, etc.): Zechs has long silver hair that he always ties behind his head. He is muscular but not a big guy, and always wears a thigh-length, light grey suede trench coat (collar turned up and unbuttoned) that goes over his always untucked shirts of varying color, that are tight and kling to him, and his loose black cargo pants. Sometimes he wears a solid black, single-strapped bagpack (the kind that go from shoulder to waist across the torso), but that is rare.<BR>
<BR>
Background:  <BR>
	<BR>
	Zechs Marquise was born on October 19, 1977, in New York, New York.  More specifically, the part of town was called Little Italy, and Zechs family ruled it all.   He was the son of Heero Marquise mafia king pin of new york, and being the only male in a family with three sisters made him the sole air to the Mafia rule.  So Zechs ,at the mere age of six, already had his life plannned out for him, but somone else had a plan for him and the rest of his family too.  It was Jimmy the "butcher" Ventura, family head of the Bronx area, he wanted Heero's territory, and would stop at nothing to get it.  That includes hiring a hit man to kill the whole family.<BR>
	Zechs was late getting home from school and he knew that his dad hated it when he was late, so he hurried home and even prepared an excuse to try to get out of a punishment.  When he finally arrived at his house he found more than a angry father, he found a dead family, more specifically his dead family.  As he ran from the house littered with bodies he was intercepted by the hit man that did the job, and suddenly Zechs didnt care if he lived or died and took the Man on right there, but this David had no chance against Goliath, and when Zechs realized this he broke down crying right there.  He got lucky that the hit man took pity on this newly orphaned child, and took him in as his own.<BR>
	The hit mans name turned out to be Duo Maxwell, an ex fed with a love for the art of killing, but this killer had a weakness, a want of a companion, someone to share his joy with and that is what he got in Zechs, he also got an apt pupil with a rage in his heart.  Over the years Duo taught Zechs all he knew about the art of death, even the teqniques he learned in the FBI, and Zechs became especially talented at distance riflery and information gathering, or in normal terms, sniping and spying.<BR>
	After a while they became partners, Zechs would use his wit and charisma to line up the contractors and they would both take on the target, it was an unstopable team that made enough money to support a small army through WWIII, but that isnt why Zechs did it, he did it to quench the anger in his heart.  That is probally the reason he later killed Duo, just for resolve, a resolve that killing the man that made him into what he was, could only create.  After that Zechs looked to begin a "business" of his own, that is how he ended up in Isle Voletta, he wants to make a new beginning for himself in a new place, but now that he has killed the reason for his anger he also thinks that he may find another profession, eventhough what he does best is kill.<BR>
