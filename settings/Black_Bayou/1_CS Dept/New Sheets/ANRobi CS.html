</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> Amanda has full blonde hair, that might come to down below her shoulders.  She often leaves it down, seeing no reason to keep it up, when it is so short.  She has light blue eyes.  Though if you look closely you might see the hint of silver that lives in them.  She has a white complection that seems to be too white at times, though no one pays much attention to it in the dull light of the bars.  Her slim figure is 5'11, and she weigh 115 lbs.  You could often see her with her favorite black Ray-Ban sunglasses, and dark red leather jacket that reaches below her waist.  Jeans, and black pants are usually an option, but once and a while you see her in a nice skirt.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>   Born somewhere in Utah, July 6, 1978, she lived there throughout her childhood years.  She was an only child after her mother had a miscarriage, and they never tried again.  Sure you could say her childhood is normal, because of course, there were no weird experiences or what not, which brought along her carefree personality.  Most days were spent lying around, and enjoying the sunshine, and the beautiful mountains.  Her parents had made a wise decision in letting her grow up in such a beautiful place, so she could remember it always.  Some years later, she moved to California to live with some relatives, though her Utah accent wouldn't dissapear all the way, because of disputes with her parents of where she was going to school.  Ah, the rebel years.  Of course then she went to a junior college after all that, and then flew away to the other side of the country just to get away from her family.  That's how she ended up in Voletta you see, it looked so pretty and serene like home, yet so far away from them, and she's never been back since.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
