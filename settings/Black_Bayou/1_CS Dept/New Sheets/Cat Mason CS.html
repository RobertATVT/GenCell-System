      Advantage:   Everyone hates a cop killer.  You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they never travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller present, police characters can call for back-up in most situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 10 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human soul is known to manifest itself during desperate times of need.  During times of intense fear or when faith is the only thing they have left, mortals tend to reach deep down into places they didn't even know existed and harnessing this energy from everything that makes them mortal.  As a result, the player may add +8 to the next Faith roll their character makes (only applies when a the Faith skill is used).

  Background:<BR>
      <BR>
      Grew up in Atlanta, Georgia in a very political family.  Her father George Mason was the governor of Georgia for two terms.  Her mother ran the family and Catherine was taught all the proper etiquette of a nice southern girl.  Even at this young age, her natural analytical mind and interest in law enforcement was seen.  President of her class in High School, Valedictorian, she attended George Washington University in Washington DC.  with the blessing of her controlling father who had hopes she would meet and marry a Senator or his son and play political liasion for him.  She had her sights higher than that and much to his dismay she studied, criminal law, political science and investigative law.  During her summers she interned at the Department of Criminal Justice in Washington DC.  She graduated in the top 1% of her class and received a Masters Degree in Criminal Law with a minor in Political Science.  <BR>
      <BR>
      After graduation she returned back to Georgia.  With help from her father, she entered a predominately male work enviorment and landed a job in the Internal Affairs Department of the Georgia State Police.  With long hours, her skills and in depth analytical ability on cases involving cops, soon proved her worth to the department.  Having achieved an award for excellence for convicting a group of Georgia cops that skimmed drugs from their busts and money that was suppose to be turned over to their departments.    Wanting to move from the big city and hearing of an opening in Isle Voletta, she put in a transfer request to transfer to the Internal Affairs division there.  While awaiting notice of an interview, she has taken a paid leave from the Georgia State Police to visit Voletta.  Currently she is the Internal Affairs Director of the Plaquemine County Sherriff's Department.  <BR>
