 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

 <B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#808000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  When the vampire begins to fully explore its animal nature, it eventually learns to harness that side of itself, forcing it to the surface.  This sparks a change that slowly becomes physical, coalescing into the form of a wolf.  Unlike werewolves, who are masters of the art, vampires have only limited control of the appearance of their wolf forms.  Most appear as large, black wolves, however, some may  turn into a wolf ranging in color from gray to black and range in size from a large collie to a full sized wolf, dependent on body weight. Further, a single "type" must be chosen and placed on the CS and adhered to from then on if other than the basic. This is merely for individual RP and will not alter any stats or abilities other than those listed above. All Vampiric wolves have eyes that glow an eerie red.  The vampire only gains a slight difference to its sense of smell while in this form and is not attuned enough with the wolf to discern between the different scents and their meanings.  The vampire gains +1 to his body while in this form.  A vampire cannot feed in this form, since it must ingest the blood directly from the body of the vessel.  They also cannot use any masteries other than Mindspeak, Extended Mindspeak or those requiring a Body roll while in this form.<BR>

       Psychological Profile:<BR>
            Peter, a vampire, suffers from the delusion of being mortal. Having read up on poryphia, a psychological illness which causes people to believe they are vampires, he belives he is nothing more than a normal human with this disease delusion. Poryphia victims give stunningly strong arguments to support his case as many have symptoms to the point of refusing to go out in sunlight, drinking blood, growing nervous around crosses, etc.. Peter is thoroughly convinced that this is his problem and, regardless of any counterevidence, refuses to be convinced otherwise. Hence he suffers from the delusion of being a mortal with the delusion of being a vampire.<BR>
            Poryphia is not his only peive of evidence to support his delusional theories. As for his symptoms, he tends to lead towards MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder). Cases have been documented where a person is allergic to something, such as milk, while in one personality, but then when they switch to another personaliy, milk would have absolutely no effect on them. Because of this, he is convinced that the mind, if it is delusional, can cause the body to act abnormally in certain circumstances. This is how he explains having a small black dot permanently burnt into one of his eyes by sunlight.<BR>
            Peter has, in fact, developed a split personality, though not in the way he belives it to be. These two personalities can be distinguished as the Human and the Non. The Human is still the dominant personality, however, the Non has been able to take control at times. Peter knows what he does while under the influence of both as they are both the same mind, they simply cause such a difference in  both thought process and actions that it is to the point of seeming to be two separate personalities. This is probably caused by the fact that he has never been shown what he is, therefore, as a human, he deals with it the only way he can, by repressing it. Although he considers his other personality evil and attempts to repress it, it tends to take control in times of long-term mental and physical stress. This most often occurs after he has gone a month or so without feeding. As the dominant personality, the Human will generally stay in control at almost all times, even in the face of extreme danger. It is only when the Human and the body have been weakened over a vast amount of time that the Non takes control. And this control often only lasts long enough to feed again. Once Peter has fed, he tends to give control back to the Human until the Non is needed again. <BR>
       Peter's explanations for his extreme condition spread so far as to the vast overnight changes in body weight and physical appearance. After a month of not feeding, he tends to literally be not much more  than a skeleton. Then, overnight he regains his normal health after just one feeding. He believes this is nothing more than a type of anorexia. Anorexia, and bolemia, cause the victim to view themselves innappropriately. For instance, the 5'11" 96 lb female who looks at herself in the mirror and thinks she's too fat. Normally, this will cause the person to go on extreme diets (wether it be not eating or extreme over-eating). He beleives his version of Anorexia behaves the same way, but is triggered by this blood feeding ritual. He belives that the longer he goes without feeding, the more his mind tricks him into thinking he's getting weaker. Then, when he feeds, it triggers his mind into once again beleiving he looks normal.<BR>
            He also exhibits certain tendencies which can be traced back to adolescence and early adulthood. Even as a child, Peter tended to live an isolated lifestyle, clinging to only one or two friends at a time. This may have developed from the constant moving his family endured while his father was in the military. His masochistic tendencies began roughly the time his father died. Which is also when he began his martial arts training. Whether the masochism can be linked to the training or to his father's death is unknown, though it is more likely a combination of the two.<BR>
            His intense martial arts training gave him a sense of honor, to protect the weaker ones from the stronger. He kept this feeling of honor even after he turned into a vampire, however, after months of both physical and mental abuse by his own and other vampiric families, he has all but lost that sense of honor and replaced it with a sense of survival. He tends to be extremely cautious in any setting, almost to the point of an animalistic caution. It is only when he is called on by family or friends that this sense of honor is regained.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>           With Peter's father being in the military, his family would constantly move from base to base. Because of these rapid transition periods, Peter would never gain any close friends in the short times between moves. He became extremely dependant upon his family for comanionship and comfort. Especially his father, who was always therefor him whenever he needed a friend.  <BR>
            In 1988 his father died in a plane crash which Peter still blames himself for. It was a monday morning and his father was ready to ship out, but Peter wanted his bike fixed so he persuaded his father to catch the next flight out. Reluctantly his father agreed and the plane he did end up taking crashed en route, killing everyone on board. In Peter's teenage mind, his bike being fixed somehow caused that plane to crash. During the closed casket service, Peter snuck back in and opened the casket to get one last look at his father. His father's burnt face is still a constant torment to Peter.<BR>
       After his father's death, the family moved back to Fairhaven, MA to live there permanently. Five years later, his mother died in an automobile accident. Peter moved in with his sister and finished college as they struggled to support each other. The two of them grew extremely close and when she was raped and killed in September of 1996, Peter felt like he could kill someone for the first time in his life. On a tip from a friend who worked with the police, Peter went to a small town called Isle Voletta, LA in search of the killer.<BR>
            On September 25, 1996, the day he was planning on going back home, he was attacked from behind and his hand and finger were sawed off. It was that night that Chantall Billaud found him crawling back across the parking lot to the club. After a breif, incoherent conversation, she carried him off into the woods to embrace him. Three days of torture and a night dead in his Mother's bed later, Peter started a new life. At first Peter lived with his mother and her family in the Billaud mansion. That ended the night our beloved family head Geoff Billaud, was visciously murdered and the mansion burnt. Later, he met Monet Roux. The two of them promised to be faithful to each other in an unofficial marriage and his mother gave them a cabin just outside of town. For a honeymoon of sorts, she sent them on a honeymoon to Paris. Monet never returned from the honeymoon. She ran into her grandmother who requested that she stay there and finish her family training. Peter returned home having been told she would be gone only a week. Even though he had no way of contacting her, he awaited her return for over 2 years before a relative of Monet's came to Voletta and informed Peter that she had been killed.<BR>
            Peter's life has been a hard and lonely life since his embrace. His family having forgotten about him, his mother abandoning him to be Gaeton Beaucage, her third son, his wife gone, probably forever. However, he has begun to make a life for himself. He has been the Head of several computer programming departments, has designed and mass marketed his own software, and is currently working for himself as a private contractor. Maybe someday, he'll even be happy<BR>
