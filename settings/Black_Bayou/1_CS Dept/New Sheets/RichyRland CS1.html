They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen, and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A creature reborn to darkness, vampires long ago developed the ability to gain control over shadows.  Basically it is nothing more than an illusionary tool used to conceal themselves from sight.  This power requires so much concentration that rapid movement (attacking or walking normal speed) will negate the effect.  If activated in an area with no shadows, this power is useless.  The vampire can cause shadows to surround itself, hiding its location from sight.  The vampire will remain hidden until it releases the shadows or attacks its prey, the shadows parting before it.  Attacks made while under the cover of Shadow Manipulation are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Vampires under this mastery may not be targeted for attacks, nor can they 'target' anyone for attack.  They may not be seen, and this includes any and all forms of 'sight', including infrared and ultraviolet, but they may be smelled or heard. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

Background<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>Richard LaMollette Roland Is a normal Guy Born On September 4th 1976 Making him 22, His Parents Richard and Patsy Roland were excellent Parents he was brought up with both of them In there Middle Income Home In St.  Louis Missouri.  Richard Loves his Parents and they would do anything for each other, He has One brother, Alexander, They do not get along.  Richard left his Nice little suburban Home after Turning 18 because he was Bored, He want to Isle Volletta in his wanderings and became stranded there without money, too stubborn to call his parents to bail him out, Richard Hung around Is;e Voletta for a time, and eventually got a job as a manager from Thexter Mycaron (estrach) He was promoted to chief of managers, and promoted again to his current position, head of employee hiring (aka chief cook and bottle washer) <BR>
     <BR>
     Richard is a quiet unassuming young man, he is an introvert and Not at all outgoing, He is extremely polite and Nice to people but he seems slightly arrogant to people whom he doesn't like and who don't like him, as some of this arrogance is a defense for when he feels threatened.  He considers himself a romantic, but he was often too shy to actually approach any lady Richard gained a girlfriend in Voletta, Mikaela Shay Donevan, Shay was raped and Richard hunted down the rapist, and manipulated a crime lord into doing him in, and sending the tape to the police (shhh).  If Richard finds someone he does not like he tends to avoid them or snub them He is not a very "physical" person and is very nonagressive, almost pacifistic.  Richard is very Careful, But he has a hidden reckless streak, sometimes VERY hidden, he secretly longs to do some of the things he thinks about doing.<BR>
   He is very Happy go lucky and is not aware of supernatural forces at all. He is mortal.. He is a Born again Christian and that is one of the few things he is Vocal about, the only things he knows about supernatural forces are Angels and demons, (No lore on it however) If He should discover Beyond a doubt that Demons and Angels DO exist the sparks will fly. <BR>
     <BR>
     Richard is Very intelligent looking, and very intelligent in truth, though he has very low self esteem and considers himself an idiot at times. He is not very strong and because of this was not a good athlete. He does however have a brown Belt in Tae Kwon Do though because He is so Laid Back, He doesn't have very Much practical experience in using it against someone.  Richard Thinks Fast when necessary, but is very forgetful of many things (Peoples Names, His Car keys((Though he doesn't have a car)) , Etc.)  Richard Conceals his feelings Very well, and has been seen on occasion to appear almost on the verge of berserk Rage, and within twenty seconds to become calm again, maybe even less than that. <BR>
     <BR>
     Richard is 6'2 weighing 212lbs he has light brown hair and Brown soft brown eyes  he has no tattoos and a small scar on his chest from when he was a baby Richard also has a huge hideous scar across his face, the remainder of a sniper attack a short while ago, he is quite sensitive about the scar, and occasionally hides it..  He wears very conservative clothing usually No G-strings or anything like that, He usually wears Blue Jeans and some kind of shirt.  He likes Computers and Video games as well as reading, He also enjoys paintball as that is one of the few things that keep him from becoming wildly aggressive.  He does not carry a Gun, or any other type of weapon.<BR>
 <BR>
 Richard is on the verge of becoming Ballistaphobic, after being shot in the Face. Richard is growing more and more firghtened of guns and gunfire. Richard isn't a coward, but he's not suicidally brave, he considers violence to be the last option, and the act of a fool, if Richard is moved to violenece, he considers himself to have failed<BR>
 <BR>
 Since coming to Voletta Richard has many friends, Including His Bosses, Thexter Mycaron, and Nicolas Lannier, his ex girlfriend (who hates him right now, but proberably won't next week and then will the week after that) Jason Sussman, one of his best friends, Kyle Pulse another buddy, who was recently wounded in a sniper attack, James "The reck" and many others, Richard is leaning towards alcoholism and has fallen slightly away from his religeon.<BR>
