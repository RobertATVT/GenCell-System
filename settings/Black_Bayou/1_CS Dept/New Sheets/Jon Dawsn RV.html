<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000080" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or GM or ST has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Even though an angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from angel to angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to be a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While an angel is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> The angel can fill any character with a brief and overwhelming sense of compassion and amity.  If timed correctly, the person may follow through on some action they would not have done otherwise, i.e., giving to charity, befriending a lost soul, lending advice.  Using this gift to derive personal benefit is considered a grave sin.  This mastery can force another character out of their True forms (i.e., Horus, TVF, TAF, etc.).  If successful target is filled with compassion, -3 to Attack for duration.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>  </B>Jon Riley Dawson was born to Jonathon Riley Dawson II and Emelia Dawson one cold Nebraska day in early February.  The couple had been trying for conception for quite a while and had been told that because of complications from illness as a teenager, Emelia was incapable of childbirth.  It was a miracle that she and the baby made it through the birth.  However - Jonathon was to be their only biological son, his two brothers both being adopted when Jon was 9 and then 10.  Jon's father was the local preacher and the family owned a modest farm not too far outside the limits of Rawlings, Nebraska.  It was in this God fearing, hard working atmosphere that Jon was raised.  He showed excellent academic ability at an early age, as well as a love for the church.  His academic endeavors were always coupled with his learning the Bible and singing with his father.  For the most part Jon had a normal childhood and adolescence.  He was a good church-going, moderately athletic, excellent academic son who was praised by both of his parents.  <BR>
 	Things only started getting odd on his 18th birthday.  His mother had been planning a large familiy get together on that day, but Jon had a massive chemistry test the following day.  So, the few hours between school and the get-together, he decided to spend in the old hayloft of his father's never-used barn.  He spent a great deal of time studying there because it was quiet, isolated and not too cold.  But, as he was climbing the ladder, one of the barn's tomcats jumped after a mouse and landed on Jon.  The weight of his bookbag threw him off balance and he fell twenty feet to the barn's floor.  The floor was old and gave way under him, shards of broken wood ripping through his femoral artery.<BR>
 	He should have died within the span of a minute, but somehow Jon lived through the fall and the bleeding.  His mother found him an hour later, still breathing, the wound having been staunched in some way the she, nor the doctors could understand.  But that was not the most disconcerting thing.  The first...event...happened while Jon was in the garden section of the recouperation clinic he had been sent to.  The garden was outside and being in Nebraska...none of the flowers had bloomed.  However - after being in the garden for some time, a nurse went to check on Jon..only to find him covered with butterflies and seemingly in the throws of a seizure.  The minute he was shaken the butterflies flew from him to die in the cold winds and he snapped out of the violent thrashings...only to mutter the same word over and over again. "Voletta."<BR>
 	His doctor figured that in the fall Jon had damaged some sort of sensory processing section of his mind and that the crossed neuro-wiring was responsible for the visions.  In short his mind was damaged and overloading itself.  However - extensive testing showed that to be untrue and Jon was sent back to Rawlings as somewhat of a medical mystery. Nonetheless, the visions and experiences did not stop.  Jon started having terribly realistic dreams about falling from this Lighthouse into the Gulf and of this sleepy town.  He knew the name like his own...and -had- to go there.  By the beginning of March, Jon had to be supervised at all times. He spoke in tongues and saw angels.  He heard their singing and kept seeing this sad-eyed, black haired man in his dreams.  He would wander away from school if no one was watching and would murmur about someone he had to find and how he had to talk to her.<BR>
 	His parents were close to making the difficult decision of hospitalizing him when late on the eve of March 2nd, he appeared in the doorway of their bedroom.  A bookbag was thrown over his shoulder and he was fully dressed.  His hand hung at his side and as his parents turned on their light they saw the blood trickling from his hands and the growing blotches on the sides of his white sweater.  His parents moved to come to him, but he silenced them with a motioning of his hand.  His voice was serene and gentle as explained that God was calling him toward Isle Voletta and someone who lived there.  The stigmata was only a sign of mounting urgency.<BR>
 	His father -- being intensely religious -- finally understood that the gibberish of the preceding 4 weeks had been leading toward that moment and that if God willed Jon's leaving, then it must come to fruition.  So early March 2nd, Jon left his father's house to do this Father's work..with only the clothes on his back, a few possessions and the Will of God on his side. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
