System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

System/Duration:  NA/Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
Effect/Description:  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon its massive shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous hands.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to destroy the target of their fury .  It will go to whatever means necessary to kill the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been killed, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf (currently) gains +3 Body (if the rules of the curse are not adhered to, we will change this bonus to +1).  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA/Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift<BR>
Effect/Description:  A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>The werewolf has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the werewolf to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the werewolf is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the werewolf must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the werewolf possesses a natural animal quickness, which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the werewolf, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>Even the wisest and most peaceful of beings understands that use of force is sometimes a necessary thing.  The "next step" in self discipline, the ability to summon forth the beast during even the most relaxed situations.  By way of this mastery, the Horus form can be called forth whenever the Alpha desires.  When they willingly bring their beast to the surface, they are treated the exact same as any other Horus except for a limited intelligence that remains.  While they are unable to communicate or use mental masteries, they are capable of discerning who is an enemy and who is not, combine their attacks to those they choose.  As stated above, it takes 1 round to summon forth the beast within.  It takes and additional round to actually shape change to the Horus form.  No target is required when the Horus is brought about in this manner.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

System/Duration: </B>2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>Although rare, it is not unheard of for a werewolf to get out of line within the pack.  Most Alphas have realized the death of their fellows serves absolutely no purpose.  Therefore, some Alphas have learned alternate ways to handle to disobedient.  During a total eclipse of the moon, all werewolves temporarily "loose the wolf".  Meaning, they lose all of their masteries, shape changing abilities and for all intents and purposes, become mortal until the light of the moon once again graces the sky.  An Alpha who has studied this phenomena can attempt to duplicate it's affects upon a single individual by sheer force of will.  Should the Alpha beat the victim in the test of wills mentioned above, the victim will effectively loose the use of all their masteries for the rest of the scene.  This includes everything from shape changing to Mindspeak.  If the victim is in wolf or Horus form, they will immediately revert back to their mortal form.  The use of this mastery is often considered a great insult by many werewolves and if used without good reason, could result in an overthrow of the Alpha. <BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>           Rya Winterhawk is a full-blood Cherokee, growing up an honor student in the Indian schools of the '70's during the aftermath of the Native American incidents of the 60's such as Wounded Knee.  At a painfully early age, it became obvious to Rya that the only way she would ever escape the reservation would be by playing by the white man's rules, so she buckled down, graduated with honors, went to a good college to get a B.S. in Criminal Science, and upon graduation was recruited by the C.I.A.  She spent eight years with the agency before an operation went bad, nearly getting her killed.  She chose to retire after that, signing the usual security forms, and returned home to North Carolina, only to find that her parents had died in a house fire and her younger brother had drunk himself to death.  Rya left the reservation, never to return to that broken place, but still seeks after her heritage. She has recently settled in Isle Voletta, liking the wilderness and the distance from the larger cities of the white man such as New Orleans. <BR>
