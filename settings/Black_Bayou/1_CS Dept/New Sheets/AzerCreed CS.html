 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
 <B><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Luck<I> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></I>- 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  Occupation:  Currently studying psychology on his own, hopes to soon take classes to earn his degree.  Has worked as a research assistant to professors at various universities and colleges he has been near, due to his large thirst for knowledge.<BR>
  Equipment/weapons:  One long dagger (small melee size), etched with various unidentifiable designs, on sheath on under-arm strap under clothing; one automatic handgun, also concealed in clothing on under-arm strap; a backpack containing several textbooks and novels, paper, pencils, and various student supplies; and a small leather-bound journal written in an undecipherable language.  Always carries medical papers explaining his growth defect and verifying his age.  Note:  The dagger and journal were found on him after he passed into the coma.  He purchased the handgun after he was mugged a few months ago.<BR>

  Background:  Azerin Creed was an angel, a representative of the Light, chosen to join with a human host, Timothy Zerin, to complete a mission in Voletta.  However, during the joining, something went horribly and inexplicably wrong.  Instead of the usual joining of host and angel, the identity of the host was obliterated, and the mind of Azerin was fused inextricably with the host's body in the same manner that the mortal's mind was.  His celestial presence was stripped away, and now he was now just another mortal.  However, even more was wrong.  A body is not just a handy place to keep one's mind.  A mind will quickly change to fit the body it resides in, like liquid poured into a new container.  Normally, the powers of an angel would prevent this from happening, but without such powers, Azerin's mind was as malleable as putty.  The mind of an angel simply would not comfortably fit into the new body, and nearly all of his memories were lost.  Timothy Zerin's body, now occupied by the mind of former angel Azerin Creed, went into a coma for 12 years after the failed joining, before waking up to the doctors' astonishment at age 26.  Now he is mortal, with neither memories of being human nor of being an angel.  The only memories of his past are distant, removed, and he sees them only as dreams and visions, that he does not believe to be true.  He believes that mortal is all he has ever been, even though he doesn't even fully understand what being mortal is.<BR>
     There were physical side effects, as well.  At the time of the joining, Timothy Zerin was 14, and the shorting out of cosmic energies within his body caused severe damage to his pituitary system.  Now at 27, his body has not grown, his face the only part of him that has aged.  For the past year he has wandered the Louisiana Bayou, until one day he, by strange chance, happens upon Isle Voletta...</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
