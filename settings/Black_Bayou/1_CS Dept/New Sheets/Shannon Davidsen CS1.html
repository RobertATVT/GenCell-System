   <BR>
   When a vampire uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+3 vs. a TN: 20.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +5 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the vampire use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>
   <BR>
   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Wooden Stakes:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>  </B>To kill a vampire, they must first be brought down to the negative total of their body statistic.  A body of 8 would have to be brought down to -8, for instance.  Once this is accomplished, it becomes possible to get around the vampire's natural healing abilities.  Vampires happen to be susceptible to a wooden stake that penetrates the heart.  The stake must be a piece of wood no smaller than a foot in length and an inch in diameter.  Once the appropriate body number is achieved, the attacker must place the point of the stake over the vampire's heart.  A full round of uninterrupted concentration is necessary as they summon their faith, empowering the stake.  This is when a roll of 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 26 must be rolled successfully.  A ST or GM must be present.  If the roll is successful, the stake must be driven through the vampire's heart on the round following the roll.  The empowerment does not last any longer than that.  No character may attempt to empower a killing weapon more than once an hour.  As the stake passes through the vampire's heart, the faith the character used to empower it is released, spreading throughout the vampire's body.  This causes the body to burn internally and on the following round, the flames will erupt around the body.  Seconds later, nothing will remain of the body as the ashes are extremely thin, disintegrating with any kind of contact.  Since a vampire's body has to be in the negative when they are staked, they are obviously considered prone.  No attack roll is necessary.<BR>

   <BR>
   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Lore Level 2:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> You have done an incredible amount of reading on the subject of werewolves. Having read everything from the local booksellers', to the more arcane legends, you believe to know the truth.  Most of this information is, of course, false. You believe that any type of silver can kill a werewolf, once it enters the bloodstream. You also know that werewolves can shape shift into the form of a wolf. You still believe, however, that the werewolves' change into the monstrous form is related only to the full moon. You also realize merely touching silver has no effect on them. Having studied werewolves for so long, you've begun to pick up on their more subtle abilities.  When a werewolf uses a mental mastery with you as the target within line of sight from you, roll 2d6+Mind+2 vs. a TN: 20.  If you succeed, you recognize the ability and its effect, giving you a one time +3 to the resistance roll (if any) for that mastery.  (masteries requiring the werewolf use Will, Mind or Soul rolls only; cannot be used while in direct combat).<BR>

   </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Bane Water: </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Bane water is little more than water used to boil the wolfsbane herb that has been empowered with the character's faith.  It takes 10 minutes to empower enough water for 1 attack.  The water must have been used to boil wolfsbane and posted in the ST's Lair message board area each day it is used.  The empowering with faith must be role-played in the main room for the entire 10 minutes for it to work.  The character must put the bane water in whatever item they intend to attack the werewolf with prior to the empowering.  These objects can be any small item that can hold water.  Balloons, vials, squirt guns, etc.  Only 3 attacks worth of bane water may be empowered at one time.  If the character attempts to make more than 3 attacks worth, the first amount looses its ability, etc.  The empowered water may only be used by the individual that created it.  The roll to empower the water is 2d6+Soul+Faith vs TN 22.  This roll must be witnessed and approved my either a room host, ST or GM.  Attacks made against the werewolf are made as normal, depending on the method being used to hold the water.  For instance, balloons and vials are thrown while squirt guns use the small arms skill.  If an attack is successful, the werewolf suffers 1 point of damage that cannot be healed supernaturally.  The werewolf must heal the damage as any normal mortal would.  That would mean each point of damage would take 3 days.  Major Medical is the only medical skill that will help the werewolf heal faster at the maximum rate of x2. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
  Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

  System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
  Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

    </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Shannon Fortner was born and raised in Louisville, KY on April 18, 1968.  She<BR>
        graduated high school in Louisville and won a scholarship to Julliard majoring in<BR>
        drama.  With a taste for musical comedy, she began auditioning at various<BR>
        Village theaters and landed several small to mid-range parts.  The critics told her<BR>
        that while her acting was acceptable, her voice was exceptional.   While she<BR>
        didn't really believe the critics (because she wanted to be an actress) she started<BR>
        accepting jobs as a singer in several small nightclubs.  <BR>
        <BR>
        The visibility eventually paid off and she began getting small parts on Broadway -<BR>
        Hair, Anything Goes, Company, and a short stint in Cats were among her credits. <BR>
        She moved in with her boyfriend, Antonio (Tony) Dubocelli a locally well known,<BR>
        and moderately successful songwriter and began performing his material at clubs<BR>
        such as the Blue Note.<BR>
        <BR>
        After living together for 8 months, Tony and Shannon were going to be married. <BR>
        Their families were very much against the marriage... the Dubocelli's did not want<BR>
        Tony to marry an actress... "Wives should be wives and stay home and raise the<BR>
        babies!", Tony's mother screamed.  Shannon's parents still preferred to think of<BR>
        her occupation as a hobby and feared a marriage to a songwriter would keep her<BR>
        in New York and away from them.  Tragedy intervened when Tony was killed in a<BR>
        car wreck 2 weeks before the marriage was scheduled to take place.<BR>
        <BR>
        Shannon was devastated and could not bear staying on in NYC without her Tony. <BR>
        She disposed of the apartment in New York and flew back to KY.  But there was<BR>
        no consolation in KY for her.  Her parents felt Tony's death was a blessing and<BR>
        did not try to hide their pleasure.  Furthermore, all of Shannon's friends had<BR>
        moved or were heavily tied up with their own lives.<BR>
        <BR>
        Finally she remembered Tony telling her of a small city in Louisiana he had<BR>
        discovered in his travels before they had met.  It had been a source of great<BR>
        inspiration for Tony and Shannon decided that this little spot might possibly<BR>
        inspire her too.  So she packed her bags again and set out for Isle Voletta,<BR>
        Louisiana.<BR>
