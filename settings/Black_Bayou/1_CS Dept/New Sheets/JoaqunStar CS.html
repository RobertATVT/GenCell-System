<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SERIF" FACE="Book Antiqua" LANG="0">Joaquin is decended from a long line of werewolves. Both his parents, and all his siblings are of the lycanthrope variety. Born on February 10th 1978, he grew up in the mountains of Montana. Along with his brothers and sisters, he was raised in one of the upper class families that lived in the area, and neither Joaquin nor his siblings knew poverty. When Zoe, his sister who was two years his senior, moved to New Orleans for College, Joaquin became the eldest of the children. However, it wasn't until almost a year later that his parents explained to him exactly where his heritage rested. Apparently they had told Zoe before she'd left for New Orleans, and now it was his turn. They related to him tales of shapechanging creatures, moon cycles, and the Beast within. For around a week after they'd sat down to talk about it, it had become little more than a joke for him. However, over the next two days they made sure he never left their sight.  Then, on the third night, when he had planned to go to a party with some friends, the Beast broke from within him. Luckily his parents were nearby, since he was just walking out the door when the intense feelings struck.<BR>
	However, what his parents had been planning for since Joaquin and Zoe had been born, along with the rest of their siblings, turned out terribly wrong. They underestimated the physical power of the business-minded nineteen year-old. He easily over powered his father, who, only through intense willpower, managed to refrain from going Horus himself.<BR>
Joaquin remembered nothing of his first 'kill'. From the moment his eyes looked up at the full moon from the doorstep, to the second when he stood above his fathers limp body, was a blank. Naked, his mother comforted Joaquin, and reassured him that his father would not die. The next few days proved her correct, as his father truely did reawaken, as start recovering. For the first time in his life, Joaquin took his parents words at their true meaning. He took all the knowledge he could from the couple, and the next couple of times it happened, he managed to fight off the insane killer rage.<BR>
	On the more "mortal" side of his life, Joaquin made a name for himself  after taking over the ranch, and his business skills were enhanced with each passing Quarter. At the age of twenty one, present day, he decided to finally take a trip down country. The whole family had been devestated by the news of Zoe's death almost a year earlier, but life went on.. He knew that she owned a Cafe along with one of their cousins, Kali, and now Joaqiun decided to make sure that it was still running fine.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Arial" LANG="0"><BR>
