</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Angels have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the angel or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#030000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the angel is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the angel attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 18 / Instant; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>The angel may transfer their Body points to any willing (or stunned / unconscious) individual through touch.  This transfer is almost instantaneous in normal RP, but during combat, no more than 2 Body points can be transferred per round, requiring an re-roll for every additional round.  Transferring Body points to a stunned or unconscious individual without permission is perfectly acceptable.  This same mastery also has a number of minor effects, causing flowers to bloom spontaneously, or making a starving person feel as though they've just eaten their full.  In the end, a Host or GM or ST has the final say in what can and cannot be performed with this power.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Volange</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use. (##Volange##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B>NA/NA; take 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Even though an angel's essence is bound the mortal body it inhabits, when confronting the vilest evil, the angel can sometimes extend its true self.  By exerting its will, the angel's symbolic self materializes in the real world, temporarily changing the body of its mortal host.  This form varies greatly from angel to angel depending on the aspect of the Light they represent.  This form does not have to be a mortal-like form.  Angels have appeared in many different guises throughout history.  The form you choose must be chosen at Character Creation and approved.  To get approval, please send your request to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>There are a few things about this ability that remain the same, regardless of the chosen form.  The angel's true form will always  radiate a soft, white aura that anyone with the Faith skill will see as obvious.  The Angel will also gain +1 Mind and +2 Soul while in this form.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms, except Transcendence).  While an angel is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the angel will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  John grew up in a small town on the coast of Florida.  His father was the local preacher, and his mother was an elementary teacher.  John grew up tall in the light of Christ, a good kid with a kind heart.  When John was 19, an annual check-up revealed that his mother had cancer.  John's family was not rich, and the bills began to add up.  Eventually John dropped out of college, searching for a job that could provide for his struggling family.  John joined the Navy, striving to rise in rank so he could earn more money.  While his mother suffered and his father prayed, John worked, and worked hard.  At night he practiced a martial art, focusing on his inner strength.  As he grew in strength and rank, his mother progressively got worse, and his father fell into a depression.  But John would not give up, and kept striving to provide for his parents.  Finally, almost 3 years later, his mother passed away.  When the news came to him, John rushed home to be with his father, only to discover his body hanging from a rafter in the garage.  As the tears began to form in his eyes, John knew he could not stay int he same town both his parents had died in.  After a small funeral for his loving parents, John packed his things and quit the Navy, turning his eyes to the west.  There he would search for his refuge, his haven from pain.  After a full day of traveling, he pulled into the small town of Voletta, hoping to find a hotel that would give him a room for the little money he had...<BR>
