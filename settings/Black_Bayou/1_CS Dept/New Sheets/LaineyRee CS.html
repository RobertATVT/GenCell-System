System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 hour to cast<BR>
Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a full hour to cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will for the lamia to start over a gain.  The lamia must role-play the hour long casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast<BR>
Effect/Description:  The lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

System/Duration: </B>Ritual / 24 hours; takes 5 minutes to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description:  </B>At times, the Mentor may need to reprimand one of their students.  The worst punishment that could befall a lamia is the loss of their spell casting abilities.  This mastery goes a step further.  When the coven joins together, they encircle the victim.  The coven recites an ancient phrase repeatedly throughout the casting.  The Mentor then identifies the victim and calls their crimes out over the chanting of the coven.  The ritual is complete after a period of 5 minutes when the victim is completely stripped of all magical ability for the next 24 hours.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Character Background (approved by ANT Juiia)<BR>
Drake Dupree, Sr. and his wife Pamela are a premiere New Orleans couple. He's your typical old-guard Southern lawyer-turned-politician -- lots of money coming in, serving his 2nd term in the State Senate with an eye on Washinton's Senate next round of elections.  A different girl for every day of the week (and twice on Sunday!).  When sober, she's your typical old-guard Southern Politician's wife, was a beauty queen in her youth (made it so far as Miss Louisiana in 1952) and now dotes on her dysfunctional family and meaningles socials -- an occasional charity or two -- and the endless political appearances.  Staying busy helps her turn a blind eye (or two) to the parade of lovelies Drake Sr. keeps around.<BR>
    <BR>
 The Duprees are what is considered "new" money in Lousisana society. Their "mere" 2nd-generation family fortune was obtained through grandfather's shipping company. Uncle Malcolm runs that part of the family business and helps keep brother Drake in office.<BR>
    <BR>
 The Duprees have four children: Drake Jr (33), Mavis Geraldine (30) , Lavinia Celeste (27) and Rebecca Alayne (25).  Only Drake is married and is expecting his second child; (Stephanie Lynn) arrived 3 years ago.<BR>
    <BR>
 After graduating from Tulane with a degree in English, Alayne began dating the son of a business partner of her father's, Tyler Bordreau.  He was beautiful, had been a football quarterback in high school and was hot on the track of a grand and glorious law career when they started dating.  They hadn't been together more than a few weeks before a wild night at an acquaintance's party ended disastrously. Tyler refused to take Alayne home; instead opting for a little parking beneath the full moon.  Tyler was a little more convinced of the "romance" of the spot than Alayne, and despite her refusals, took full advantage of the quiet locale.  Alayne didn't make it home until well after the moon had disappeared from the sky, and was a shaking, sobbing mess when she did.  When she could finally make sense, she explained to her parents and siblings (except Vinnie who was in NYC) that Tyler had "taken advantage" of her and begged her Daddy to do something.  The wallet spoke more highly than the bloodline, though, and Drake Sr. refused to jeopardize his business dealings over a "little misunderstanding."<BR>
    <BR>
 Alayne was almost destroyed by the turn of events. She hasn't spoken to her father since, and has moved out of the family house. Despite finding the strength to leave the family, Alayne was devastated personally, and it's taken her 2 years of therapy and sisterly TLC from Vinnie to regain her life (she visits NY often).  Work has helped. Keeping busy seems to be the family coping mechanism, and Alayne has had plenty of writing to do in the mean time.<BR>
    <BR>
 It was writing that brought Alayne to Isle Voletta. She was doing an article on bed and breakfasts w/i a day's journey of New Orleans when she was drawn to the Isle.  A visit to the R&R her first night in town led her to Shannon Fortner who was more than happy to show Alayne around.  Alayne had a wonderful time, easily finished the article but stuck around for a few days of fun with her new friend.  Shannon introduced Alayne to her boyfriend Daren and to friends Shifter and Rio, but it was Shannon's introduction of Alayne to Cord LeRose that completely changed her attitude about sticking around Voletta a while.<BR>
    <BR>
 Cord and Alayne hit it off instantly and have been almost inseparable since (only Alayne's writing assignments interrupt their time). He recently took her to France for a small vacation, and they returned more hopelessly devoted to one another than when they left.  (He confessed his true nature to her, but instead of being repulsed, Alayne was even more attracted to him.)  They are quite often seen in one another's company at the R&R or on the beach before retiring to the LeRose house for the night.<BR>
    <BR>
 A few days ago, Alayne made a quick trip to cover a story in Austin where she met up with her sister Lavinia (Vinnie). In desperate need of a break from NYC after recently being mugged, Alayne dragged her sister back to Voletta to try her hand at giving her older sis some overdue TLC, and to introduce her to the man she's so gaa-gaa over.  Alayne eagerly looks forward to more time to devote to improving relationships with both individuals, as well as her friendhips w/ Shannon and Daren. Looks like the Isle's got a new writer in its midst!<BR>
