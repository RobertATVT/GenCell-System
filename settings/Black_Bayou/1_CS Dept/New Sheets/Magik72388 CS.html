<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </I>- 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff00ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.<BR>

Generation Cost: </B>15 /<B> Experience Cost: </B>75 <B><BR>
System/Duration: </B>roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Duration:</B>  The vampire is a confident creature in most situations, almost to the point of arrogance.  This confidence, when firmly believed in, can strengthen the will of the vampire, granting them a +4 to their Will for the rest of the scene.  This confidence is removed the moment the vampire fails any die roll for the remainder of the night, as its confidence is now shaken. This confidence is so powerful that the vampire may allow others to hit him and still not shake their ego. (Not roll to dodge)  Initiative does not count toward 'losing a die roll' for this mastery.<BR>

Generation Cost: </B>15<B> </B>/<B> Experience Cost: </B>75<BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 8 rounds or 4 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  By establishing eye contact and calling to them with mind speak or a spoken command, the vampire can lull their victim into doing its bidding.  The victim will act as though their mind is distant, as if they do not know what is going on while they helplessly obey the one sentence command.  If the victim is told to hurt themselves physically (like told to shoot themselves or jump off a cliff), they will automatically snap out of the mastery.  Being led to a place that would eventually cause them harm does not count in this, though. They will follow other commands to the letter (Like 'follow me into this alley' ).  The victim must immediately follow the command as closely to the stated words as possible.  In other words, the player cannot say 'okay, I'll follow you later', because that isn't the intent of the command, and upon loosing the will roll the victim no longer has the full use of their intelligence, as the victim's mind will be distant.  Room Hosts, ST's and GM's will monitor the players actions to preclude attempts to avoid following the command.  If the intention of the vampire is to feed, the player will leave with the vampire to a destination close at hand and permit the vampire to feed from them.  The bite of the vampire will not snap the intended victim out of the trancelike state.  No memory will be retained by the victim of what has occurred after the vampire has finished feeding, no matter how much vampire Lore the victim possesses.  If the victim has at least Level 3 Vampire lore, and made their roll, they will know on the following morning that they have been feed upon by a vampire the previous night, but will not know who the vampire that bit them<BR>

     Serelia Danine Morgan was born May 5, 1978 on her father's farm in Ashbourne, Ireland. Standing at 5'6" she is 110 lbs, has dark emerald green eyes, and long, deep red wavy hair. She has vrey pale, lightly frecled skin, completeing her typically Irish features.  Her wardrobe consists mostly of natural colors, grey and black, all very simple and not outstanding.<BR>

    <BR>
     Serelia's mother died while giving birth to her.  Her father, once a very cheerful<BR>
      man, became a bitter drunk after the "death" of his wife.  He was very strict and<BR>
      overprotective of his daughter and she was not allowed to leave the farm unless<BR>
      accompanied by him or her grandmother.  Her father even paid for a tutor to come and home-school her.  Because of this she's always been an independent and solitary person. Growing up, her only friend was her grandmother, whom she called Nana.  Nana protectedher "Sary" from her father while he was drunk by taking her into her room and telling her stories.  Serelia's favorites were the ones about the witches and vampires.  She always romanticized about these creatures  with their magical powers, and deep down she believed they were real.  She'd never admit to this however.  <BR>
        	On the night of her 13th birthday while her father was on a rampage, Serelia awoke to see a woman standing over her.  She couldn't see anything more than her black silhouette, but she knew the woman posed no threat.  In fact, she felt very comfortable around her.  She placed her hand on Serelia's cheek and gently whispered, "Soon you'll be away from all this... in Voletta."  Serelia had no idea what that was, but before she could ask, the woman disappeared.  Later on, Serelia dismissed this all as a dream, but she never forgot it.<BR>
        	A year later, Nana became very sick.  On her deathbed she told Serelia one last story.  She said that Serelia's mother was not dead, but rather undead.  She said that when she was 8 months pregnant she fell in love with a man who turned out to be a vampire.  He changed her into one, but hours later she went into premature labor, then fled with her lover soon after her 3 day "coma."  Nana swore to keep the child safe and never tell anyone what happened.  Everyone was told that Mrs. Morgan died in labor.  Serelia was shocked at the story, and wanted to believe her mother was still around, but Nana was heavily medicated.  What she said was impossible, and she had been speaking a lot of nonsense lately.<BR>
        	Nana died soon after and Serelia knew she had to get away from her father as soon as possible.  Her grandmother had left her a great amount of money, with the hope that Serelia would do just that.  So Serelia hid that money away and saved every cent she found lying around.  Just before her 16th birthday she bought a plane ticket and left for New York City.  Knowing she'd need a place to live she quickly made friends who let her stay with them.  They understood her problems and helped her get used to the fast paced life she'd so suddenly entered, and they even let her work nights at the cafe they owned.  To make her feel more secure in the city, her friend Brian gave her his ebony switchblade knife with the rune symbol for protection engraved in silver on the handle.  He taught her how to defend herself with it, and now she never leaves home without it.<BR>
        	This is how she lived until she was 22.  One day while helping Brian plan a trip to Louisiana, she spotted Isle Voletta on the road map.  All the sudden the memory of that "dream" came back to her.  It couldn't be... It had to be!  A week later, Brian dropped her off at a little hotel in Isle Voletta.  This was her new start, her tabla rasa, and she was ready for anything.<BR>
