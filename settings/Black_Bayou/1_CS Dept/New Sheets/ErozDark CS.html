<B> System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
<B> Effect/Description:  </B>A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly-yellowed fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B> System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B> A demon, being a part of the lord of lies himself, is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

<B> System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description: </B>Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><U>Forum Director</U>.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

<B> Effect/Description: </B>By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

A Demon can make use of any of the senses he has for a single illusion.  i.e..

	<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / see below; takes 2 rounds to activate.<BR>
	<B>Effect/Description:</B>  This is the ability to manipulate the dreams of a victim while they are sleeping. The victim will be unaware that they are dreaming and will take the events as fact, until they wake up.  If a dream becomes too horrific (Storyteller discretion), then the victim is allowed a one time roll of 2d6+Mind vs. a target number of 16 to wake up.  Otherwise, the victim will continue to sleep until the dream has ended.<BR>
	<B>Level 1 ~</B> The demon is able to control the type of dream a victim is having.  The events of the dream are random.  i.e.. a happy dream, a sad dream, a nightmare, etc.  This dream can be a maximum of 15 minutes long.<BR>
	<B>Level 2 ~</B> The demon is able to not only control the mood of the dream, but is able to actually manipulate randomly created events.  It cannot create events, only manipulate existing ones.  This dream can be a maximum of 30 minutes long.<BR>
	<B>Level 3 ~</B> At this level of ability, the demon is able to create the setting of the dream and the events that will transpire.  This dream can be a maximum of 45 minutes long.<BR>

	<B>Generation Cost: </B>15<B> </B>/ <B>Experience Cost:</B> 75<BR>
	<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
	<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A demon may take temporary possession of another's body with simple eye contact.  The real person's personality becomes submerged in their subconscious mind.  The demon has full control over the body of the victim.  The host body the demon currently inhabits will be unable to move, think, feel, anything while the demon is controlling the victim.  If the intended victim wins the roll, it is safe from further Control attempts for the rest of the night.  No victim of this mastery may be commanded to cause damage to themselves (jumping in front of a car, shoot themselves, etc.).<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=1 PTSIZE=6>  Jake 'hard as' Steel was born in Port Arthur, Louisiana. He lived in an expensive house and loved the high life. he was always a straight A student. His friends were all older than him, and were all tough boys, while Jake was known as "wimpy". His friends were probably the reason that he never got beaten up, despite being snobish. Then his friends left for college, but he still had two years of school left, he knew that he would'nt last a week, letalone two years. So during the summer after his friends left, he learnt three different fighting arts. Ninja, karate and jujutsu. He trained hard all summer, and in his spare time went to the sports center to buff up on the weights. <BR>
               	School started again, and the bullies almost didn't recognise him. He had gained nearly 2lbs of muscle, and had grown his black hair into a ponytail that reached beyond his shoulders. He never did get beaten up, and for a change, actually got a girlfriend, rather than that, he had nearly the whole female student population. The Basketball coach finnaly took notice of Jake when he was seen lifting weights at a weight most students would have disabled themselves with. But Jake didn't like Basketball, much to the complant of the Coach, saying that his size was a great plus.He took college, and always kept up his training and fitness routines. After college went to work at a butchers factory, to the distaste of his parents. He soon found out that this life wasn't for him, and went back to live with his parents. He was hired as a bouncer at a local nightclub, also to the distaste of his parents. Later that same year his father died of a heart attack. This but a major black mark on his personality, and this black mark got him fired from his job. He stopped training at the boxing center and the other fighting centers and started taking lessons as an actor. For some reason he made a really bad actor, and left this idea for a job as a security guard for the local factory. After spending nearly two years as this, he moved to Flarida, in the vain hope of reliving some of his carefree childhood. he started boxing again, and then took a position at the karate center, mostly due to his three black belts, and started training the kids. the kids either respected him, or feared him, but either way, they all did exactly what he said, and most reached their target belts with the lessons that Jake taught them.<BR>
               	Then his mother died, and this was'nt as bigger shock as his father because he was now 25, and used to the things life could throw at you. He moved back to Port Arther and sold the house and took off to a place called Isla Voletta. He currantly rents a house, and lives of his house maney, and parents life insurance.<BR>

               After a major fight with his girlfriend of two months, he ran into the woods. Inside he found himself at ease. He rested there, back against a tree stump, and he dropped into a dreamful sleep.<BR>
               The first dream was about fire. A land of fire, with HER in it. She was in the centre of a piller, shouting for help, with a flame climbing up the side, then it reached the top, and her feet caught fire, then the dream stopped.<BR>
               The next was about controlling the world. Jake stood in his kitchen, and placed a ball onto a plate, then cut it in half with a knife. Then the ball grew to twice it's size, and Jake could see that the two halfs were in fact two heimispheres of the earth.<BR>
               The last one was about a person, who always had his back to Jakes eye, who walked into the symp, and had his hand catch fire. It continued to burn, then someone dressed in a white robe walked in, and the two figures started fighting, except they didn't even touch. The robed person held out his hand and the fire person obviously felt pain, then the fire person did the same, and the robed person cringed. Then the fire person jumped onto the man and the robed person dissapeared. then the dream ended.<BR>
               Jake woke up suddenly, it was dark but a faint glow of the moon allowed him to look at his watch. 10.30. "jeez, I really need to get some decent sleep", he walked out of the wooded clearing, feeling different. A storm started half way out the woods, lightning flashed across the sky, and thunder echoed between the trees. Jake though he saw a man in a black robe ahead at one point, but when he wipped his face of the rain, he wasn't there. Then he thought he saw lightning hit the top of a tree and the tree caught alight within seconds, but it wasn't so when he looked again. Then he felt a pain in his back. sudden, like a stick had been thrown at him. He turned around at saw, not a stick, but a book, or rather a scroll. He picked up the scroll, looking around, but there was nobody there."wierd" he mumbled was he straightened up. He took the scroll out of it's silk binding, a bag that only covered half the paper. Inside were words, half in Latin, half in English. He looked over the paper, then read the English section.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>               As he read this, he remembered back to the dream about the battling people. He visulised himself as the fire person, and how he would destroy the good person,.... the angel. he looked back to the paper<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>               Jake thought about this for a second. Name I know you as? what is that? Satan? Devil? Beelzebub? "LORD" he shouted to the dark sky, lighning crossed his view as soon as he finished the word. Great pain suddenly pulled at his feet, like he was being pulled into the ground. Then the pain spread to his whole body, lastly his head, which finally made him pass out.<BR>
               If you had been watching from a distance, you would have seen the lightning cross the sky, then Jakes feet catch fire. Prehaps you would think that he dropped a lighter onto a patch of leaves, except no lighter fell. The fire grew up his body and stopped at his neck, then overcame some forcefield around his head, and engulfed it in fierce flame.<BR>
               Jake woke up, but he looked out of his eyes in a kind of tunnel vision, like he was at a distance inside his head. He walked with difficulty, slowly getting nearer to the end of the tunnel in his eyes, then he finally got his usual eyesight back, but when he looked at his watch it was still night, midnight. But he looked around like it was daylight. He walked out of the woods and straight to his car, and drove home, without his headlights on.<BR>
               He slept for three days straight. When his woke again, he felt like he had a mission. He felt like somebody had told him to find some kind of people, and kill them, and then spread the word of.....He was amazed, he was about to say that he needed to preach about Satan. Then he remembered back to the night before (as he knew it) and remembered that he was right, he must spread the word of Satans great world, of hell and the dirty heaven.  <BR>
               He stood up, still fully clothed from the night when he changed, and walked out the front door. He had a mission.<BR>
