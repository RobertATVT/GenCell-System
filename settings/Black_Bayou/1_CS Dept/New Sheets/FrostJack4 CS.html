<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> Werewolves have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the werewolf will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by bane water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Horus Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##HorusForm <target of rage>##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA / Until target(s) is destroyed; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Tall, muscular, and extremely strong, this raging beast is terror incarnate.  The massive head of a deranged wolf sits upon a massive set of shoulders.  Thick matted fur covers its body as four inch claws tip the fingers on their enormous paws.  Their eyes are slits like animals, but still retain their human color.  Their reasoning is that of a maddened beast; pure instinct.  Impervious to logic, they seek only to <I>destroy</I> the target of their fury.  It will go to whatever means necessary to <I>kill</I> the target of its rage, whether it is loved one or foe.  Once the target has been <I>killed</I>, reason begins to fight its way back.  How the Horus reacts depends on the individual it is.  Some flee while others fall to their knees sobbing.  While in Horus form, the werewolf gains +3 Body.  Due to its enraged state, the Horus is immune to the following masteries: Terror, Hypnotic Suggestion, Mind Scrye, Illusions, and Twisted Visions.  Since the Horus is unable to think rationally, it may only use the following masteries: Dulled Pain, Rending, Agile Wolf, and Terror.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Mindspeak</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> -  0 Soul to use.  (>>::target of Mindspeak:: message<<)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the werewolf is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the werewolf attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shape shift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:  </B>A werewolf who is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear in many different shapes and sizes, their wolf forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in wolf form, they gain +1 Body.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a werewolf is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the werewolf will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Jack was born to parents that were werewolves, in a small town in Nebraska.  When he was still an infant his parents gave him up for adoption early one due to the fact that they felt they were too scared for what may come of his birth.  So he was given up for adoption and placed in a foster home with lots of other kids who had been given up for adoption.  Early one Jack exhibited traits of his werewolf status.  He seemed to have more strength then the other boys, and a much more agressive nature.  When he was around the age of 9 he was adopted by a nice couple, the Frosts.  He was soon taken out to a Farm where he had many blissful years up until the age of 18 when his first transformation occured.  He ended up killing both of his foster parents in a blind rage brought on by the beast within him.  Horrified by what he had done he ran.  He ran not understanding what had happened back there. By the time he was 22 he had learned how to control his temper much better and learned how to store it and release it only when he needed to, almost like a rain check. He drifted around from place to place.  When he was about 23 he began learning the Art form known only to his own breed.  He quickly learned upon it and became exceptionally good at it.  He was around the age of 28 when he stumbled upon Volletta and its strange mythical prescence.  Deciding this place may hold some answers he ambled on in and decided to see what this place was all about.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
