<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  	Born in beautiful Los Angeles, California, Yuric was originally from a high class society of people.  His father was the Chief Executive Officer of a major corporation while his mother was the Vice President of the same company.  Yuri was a decent student, and seemed like he was on the right track.  Though he was sent to a rich private school, rather than the public high school, he always seemed to get into trouble.  He fought constantly with the other students, smoked on campus, and was eventually caught dealing illegal drugs, heroin and marijuana.  He stayed out late at night, usually "borrowing" one of his father's cars and driving into the city.  It was at this point in his life in which he made contact with the gangs, though he was first viewed as an outsider, he was eventually accepted on the grounds that he had access to large amounts of cash, funds necessary to fuel the gang's "propositions".  After getting busted on drug charges by the cops, Yuric's father decided to straighten out his son and pulled him out of school and put him to work at the company.  He underwent what seemed like a total change, he got into no more trouble, was home on time, everything was back to normal.  But it wasn't, he'd faked the whole thing, once he'd earned there trust he hacked into the company account and embezzled over $200,000.  With a steady cash flow, he earned a high spot in the gang.  Finally, at age 24, his past caught up with him and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  He returns to the gang to find it disbanded and reformed under new leadership.  With the change, he is put back at the bottom, though he deserves more from the gang.  He is sent to Voletta to kill a rogue member, though a part nags at him, about getting back at the new leaders and claiming his rightful place in the gang.<BR>
