<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  N/A / Takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When faced with danger, Mortals have developed the so-called 'Fight-or-Flight' response, basically a surge of epinephrine to enhance strength and reduce reaction time. Mortals who have taken this 'Fight-or-Flight' response to the next step, i.e. Mortals who have purchased this mastery have controlled their response to only the Flight portion. Upon activation of this mastery, the Mortal has focused his concentration enough to allow him a better chance to elude those seeking to harm them, granting them a +4 to his quickness while escaping. However, the normal time limits on escape must be followed.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Mind vs. TN 16 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some mortals have learned to read the facial expressions and body language of others.  These insightful individuals can occasionally pinpoint someone else's emotional state just by observing them for a few seconds.  The victim must IM the mortal, describing their emotional state.  Angry, aroused, excited, and distraught are only examples.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B> Short cropped hair, dark brown eyes that seem to hold a mysterious secret.  Muscular build born of hard work, and determination.  More of a thinker and brooder then a fighter or a lover.  He usually prefers the solitude of his car or a garage with a Ford Big Block and a Six Pack of MGD.  Usual attire includes jeans, and a t-shirt with a leather jacket.  On the surface he seems to be the typical "gear head" mechanic, but under the surface lies a man with an IQ well over 175.  One who prefers that people think of him as a "simple mechanic" rather then try to figure out his complexities.  He is in Voletta in search of solitude.  He is also in search of someone.. Himself.. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>

 Height/weight: 6'1" 190 lbs<BR>

 Occupation: Unemployed, skilled mechanic.<BR>

 Equipment/weapons: No weapons, Equipment includes a small tool box, and his vehicle, a 1966 Mustang.<BR>
<BR>
  Background:<BR>
   The head lights were brighter then he thought they would be.. but he couldn't look away from them.. He knew he should watch the road.. search for the one thing that would get him out of this accident... but the lights had been so bright, all he could do was watch them... Then came the crash.. glass flying into his face... half blinding him, splintering into his left eye.. sparing his right...  <BR>
<BR>
::jerking upright so quickly his head smacked painfully on the door handle of the mustang he awoke from the nightmare.  The same one that he'd been having since the accident.  The accident that had lead him to his own version of hell... one where he was not sure of what was going to happen from one day to the next..  one where he was not sure of who was going to scorn him.. and one where he was not himself:::<BR>
<BR>
" All I remember is that I used to work on cars.. and I'm darned good at it.. I dont think I was married or had kids.. Cause there's no pictures in my wallet.  It says my name is Nathan Derrick Slater.  That's all I remember, and it's too hard for me to continue here without knowing who I am or what I did, that's why I'm leaving.. That's why I'm going to Voletta, where no one knows me, and no one will bother me."  <BR>
<BR>
:: the words sounded hollow to him.. but they must have convinced the Doc because he was released and sent on his way.  He had been on a probationary period.. a phase they called "reintroduction".  He assumed it meant they were trying to reintroduce him to the world so he wouldn't freak out, but it was too late.  Nothing in his place had sparked any memory, and nothing had seemed like it was his.  All he took were three changes of clothes and a small tool box that fit in the trunk of his Mustang.  He didn't even remember the car, but it was his or so the registration said.  Locking up the apartment and slipping the key under the mat he awaiting the tears or sorrow that he thought might come, but of course they didn't.  There was no sorrow when you left a place that was not yours.::<BR>
<BR>
"I'm hear Doc.. Just pulled in last night and I'm looking for a place to stay right now.  I promise I'll call if there are any developments, but don't hold your breath.  It's been two years, and I dont remember anything.  It's like a nightmare, and no matter how much I pinch myself I can't get myself to wake up!!!"  :: With that he hung up the phone and began to walk back to the Mustang.. Preparing to invent his life as he went along.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
