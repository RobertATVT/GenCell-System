These artists create with words; developing stories, cities, even worlds for us to escape to.  Great authors are in a category of only a handful that have the possibility of living forever in their prose.  Authors often have other skills to allow them to grow closer to their subjects in order to gain inspiration.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Bat Form</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Bat Form##)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Unlimited; takes 1 round to shapeshift.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> A vampire that is attuned to its own inner nature is able to assume its sister form at will.  They appear to be rather small and difficult to notice, their bat forms often taking an appearance characteristic of their personality.  They still retain their normal eye color, however.  While in bat form, they have +2 Quickness and -4 Body (a minimum of 1 remaining).  A vampire in bat form effectively cannot see.  It uses active sonar to move around.  Attackers suffer -4 to their roll when they try to attack the small vampire bat.  A vampire can feed in bat form, but cannot use any other masteries while in this form.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></I>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><I> </I>- 0 Soul to use (no room command needed)</B><BR>
<B>System/Duration: </B> NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Vampires have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the vampire will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed by this mastery.  Wounds from sunlight or fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Limb Regeneration Time (Attn: FD)">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#804000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> By concentrating on a chosen target, the vampire is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the vampire attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:  </B>NA/NA<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The vampire can see twice as far as a normal human can.  In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the vampire takes on the effects of infravision.  Unable to make out detail, the vampire can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Gabriel was born in 1972 in New Orleans.  However, he grew up in France and lived there most of his life.  He was raised by his mother Monique, his father having died when he was 2 years old.  His father had been a vampire slayer like his father before him, and thus the mantle was to be passed on to Gabriel.  But being that Gabriel's father died when he was so young, there was not alot of training that could be done.  Gabriel's mother, however, had been able to teach him the basics about protection against vampires, and the different methods of destroying them, as Gabriel's father had taught her in order to protect her.  Being a notorious slayer, Gabriel's father had constantly been hunted by vampires, and he knew that Monique would be in constant danger from these vampires.  Ironically, Monique survived, but it was Gabriel's father that was eventually taken down by a gang of the undead.  <BR>
	Gabriel wanted to be a vampire slayer like his father, but he was more interesting in writing.  He did very well in school, and was given a scholarship to a school in America, where he majored in English Literature.  In his senior year, a short story he had written was published in a collection, and Gabriel was paid $1000 for his story.  He became serious about becoming a writer at this point, and managed to land a deal with a moderately large publisher.  Slaying became second priority, though he never forgot what he'd learned.  <BR>
	When he finished college he wrote his first book.  It made the best seller list for 10 weeks, and landed him an even better deal with his publisher.  He decided he wanted to write a gothic, occult-oriented novel.  The interest in the subject, of course, came from what his mother had taught him.  And though he understood the basic mechanics of vampires, he had never really experienced them firsthand.  He went to his mother, asking her where he could go to experience the occult better.  She asked him to take his mind off of it and not bother going to such a dangerous place, but she she saw she could not shake him, she told him about Isle Voletta, but did not mention that it was the town in which his father had been killed.  And so he went.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
