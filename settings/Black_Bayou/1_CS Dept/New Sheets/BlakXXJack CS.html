 The prophets of our generation, some mean well, while some don't.  But they have a unique power over us, the gift to sway us, to tell us anything they want to and somehow make us actually believe it.  It's a good thing they're on our side.  They are on our side...right?<BR>

 <B>Advantage:</B>  Religious Leaders hold an incredible sway over the community.  Many people hold a solid belief that Religious Leaders can do no wrong.  Obviously this reputation can be tarnished, but until it does, a Religious Leader is almost always believed over someone who is accusing them.  The religious leader receives a +3 to any roll involving their Theology skill.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>   </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>	Jacob Dominic Barikson was born October 27, 1975.  He grew up and spent most of his life in New York City, the son of Maria and John Barikson, who were both heavily involved with drug smuggling and dealing.  When Jack was 11, both of his parents were shot.  Their bodies were left in the family's house, and Jack found them when he came home after school.  He was taken into an orphanage, but never really settled in, and when Jack was 13, he ran away from the orphanage, living on the streets.  His sharp mind made up for his lack of physical ability, and after years of his parents' sheltering him from criminal life, he walked down their road.  By the time Jack was 20, he was a savvy ringleader who ran his gang through sheer guile.  At 21, he was killed, or so his enemies thought.<BR>
 	In one of the many suburban areas of the city, Jack was run down by a rival gang leader's lackeys, hit full-on by a car he never saw any of, save the glow of the headlights.  He was left for dead, his legs and lower back so thoroughly devastated by the crash that walking would have been impossible.  Jack regained consciousness, and through force of will, did the impossible.  Crawling and walking in alteration, he made it to his personal physician, who arranged for him to get out of New York by plane.  His legs healed over a course of months, and when they were healed completely, he began to wander the nation, moving away from his life of crime and making up for the end of his education by studying everything he could in his meandering.<BR>
 	After a year of these wanderings, Jack Barikson arrived in Isle Voletta, Louisiana.  Soon after his arrival, he was contacted by demonic forces who offered him power in exchange for servitude, and he eagerly accepted.  Gradually, his focus of attaining power for himself changed to a strange religious fervor, in which he saw his duty as preparing the world for hell, by making people as perverse as possible; his logic was that if someone could become as inhumanly corrupt as possible, hell would be paradise to them.  His memory of a year and a half of demonic servitude is shoddy; he knows that at the end of it, his possessor ascended back to heaven, regaining its status as an angel.  Jack was offered the chance to follow in its ascent and declined, wanting to continue his mission, his psyche firmly directed to service in hell's ranks, even if he was no longer among them.<BR>
 	The next six months were taken up in finding himself again, spent trying to gather the shambles of his life after the newly ascendant angel reworked Jack's memory "for his own good."  Many of the memories of his wife Fiona were taken away, as well as other residents of Isle Voletta; all of his memory of his powers as a demon, and of hell, were taken, and now Jack has only the most basic idea of what he was.  Now that Jack feels he has the pieces put together, he's returned to Voletta to put his life back together, with a new light on his life: he serves hell, but no demon.  He's a free agent of sorts, even if he's a weak mortal once more.  Now he can make his moves with full freedom.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
