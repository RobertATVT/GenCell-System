 The men and women in blue, justice over all, highly trained and fully equipped to handle every crisis.  Well, almost any crisis. The modern day heroes.  Anyone can be an ex-officer, but only those that get hired by the Sheriffs Department are active officers in-character.<BR>

 <B>Advantage:</B>   You better think more than twice about touching one of these guys, and they rarely travel alone.  When there is a Storyteller or Room Host present, police characters can call for back-up in drastic situations and have 2 - 6 non-player character officers arrive one the scene within 4 - 8 rounds (2 - 5 minutes), depending on the situation (as determined by the Storyteller or Gamemaster).  Police characters also know how to use those weapons they carry on their hip and gain a +3 to their Small Arms skill.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Adrenaline</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)</B><BR>
 <B>System/Duration:  </B>NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

 <B>System/Duration:</B>  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 <B>Effect/Description:</B>  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>The Gift</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>- 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. <U>(Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills)</U>.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>

  Skye has a slim, athletic build.  She wears a black Stetson, a black leather jacket, a semi-tight v-neck white t-shirt, form fitting blue jeans, and black coyboy boots.  She has long, curly red hair that falls around a pale, delicte face with bright, light blue eyes with a grey ring around them, kinda like a wolfs.<BR>

 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Skye was born and raised on a ranch about 50 miles outside Texas.  She had a loving home with her mother and father, who had bought the ranch just after leaving Ireland ( They were both werewolves and were trying to escape pursicution).  She had a happy, content childhood untill the day of her 16th birthday, when a band of outlaws, who were running from the police broke into her home and killed her parents after brutally beating them.  Skye was only spared because of the fact that she had escaped out her 2nd floor window and hid in the barn for 3 days, when the outlaws were chased off.  She stayed only long enough to finish high school and sold the ranch and began to roam the country, taking with her only some clothes and the four last gifts her parents gave her....Jemm, a black arabian horse, a set of ruby encrusted daggers, a medalion with a wolf on it, and her truck.  She went from state to state, finally returning to texas to become a Texas Ranger and look for the evil men that had destroyed her family.  She found them, killed the leader and put the rest in prison, but not before being charged with murder for the death of the leader.  She was found innocent, but was fired from the Rangers.  She began to wander around the country again, and stopped in at a place called Isle Volleta to rest her weary soul for awhile....</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B><BR>
