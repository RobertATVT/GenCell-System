 Special Abilities<BR>
 <BR>
<BR>
Adrenaline - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>
<BR>
Luck - 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>
<BR>
The Gift - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation. (Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat Skills).  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>
  <BR>
Masteries<BR>
  Heightened Awareness - 1 Soul to Use(##Aware##)<BR>
Generation Cost: 5 / Experience Cost: 25  <BR>
System/Duration: roll 2d6+Will vs. TN 22 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
Effect/Description:  Some people are just naturally more aware then others. Call it paranoia. Call it vigilance. Call it heightened awareness.  When concentrating, some mortals can expand their senses, making themselves more aware of their surroundings.  This ability grants the mortal a +3 to all initiative rolls.  This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).<BR>

  <BR>
  Background<BR>
  Did well in highschool, went to college, speciallizing in biochemistry.  Had all his education paid for by his parents.  After college, set out on his own, and quickly got hired, and became mildly presitigous for his work, mostly in hemoglobin.  Living in a nice apartment, and working at a local lab, once day he got an odd request to process a blood sample.  He soon discovered irregularities, and quickly published the material about what he thought were incredible mutations.  At this point, he soon became noticed.  A week after posting the material, he was ambushed at his apartment building, when two masked men knocked him down and kicked him repeatedly.  He was fortuante, as a neighbor called the police and threatened the attackers with a small, empty, revolver.  The two men fled, and escaped the police.  <BR>
	Tyler went to his room, and had the locks replaced.  After a week in bed, he began to return to work, never traveling alone, but making use of a carpool to get anywhere.  He began to investigate the abnormal blood some more.  He continued to Show the world what he was discovering, the unusual benifits of the blood.  Upon wokring late one night, roughly two months after his beating, he heard a sound at one of the doors.  he soon ran out a diffrent exits and to a bus stop.  As he entered the bus, he cold faintly see traces of smoke emerging from the building.  <BR>
	The complex had barely been damaged, but all of Tylers personal thigns, his desk, pictures, computer, all were either set afire or beaten with a crowbar left on the scene.  None of the lab smaples were touched.  The police had no leads.  Tyler was sure someone was after his life, that they were after him.  Theyw anted to kill him.  He began to become afraid, an cautious.  He stopped publishing any of his work, and soon submerged back into disrenown.  Yet, still, curiosity tugged at him, and he continued to experiment.  He never strayed far from his co-workers, and lost almost all of his social life.  <BR>
	One day, a smoke bomb went off in one of the bathrooms.  As the fire alarms went off, everyone left the building.  Tyler, who was working at the time, selaed his samples, and took them with him, along with a few computer diskettes to finish at home.  Upon arriving at his apartment, he found only the gutted room, the flames had taken everything.  The police reported a bomb having gone off.  <BR>
	Tyler withdrew his money from the bank, bought soime clothing and a duffel bag.  feraing for his life, he moved out of town.  Staying at a hotel for abotu a week, he carried the duffel bag with him where ever he went.  He barely slept.  He feared for his life.  Some nights, he thoguht he heard breathing noises... other nights, scrathes at the door.. or window... on on his bed...  One night, there was a crash, Tyker jumped to his feet and ran to the kitchen, as he looked back he saw a black object hit his bed, and he dived behind the refridgerator as the grenade went off.  Sheltered from the worst of the heat, he escaped with only cuts and bruises.  <BR>
	He fled town, and traveled by night.  Traveling aorund, he searched for someplace he could hide.  An active place, where he could get a job.  <BR>
	And thus, Voletta approached.  And he fled into it's arms.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Believes in God, but fails to understand him/her, and many of the teachings of religion.  Seeks friend and romance, not only to confide in, but also to help hide him. Hopes they can help him, and fix him.  Suffers from insomnia, usually several nights a week.  Has psychological problems induced by his fear, and the events in his life (neurosis).  During insomnia roughly one every two weeks, he can, and often does thigns he does not remember, including hitting himself (although rarely enough to cause even a bruise), Wandeirng the streets, spilling things, etc. Will not speak on these occasions.  Does not recognise any of this, and suffers from denial, usually explains with he probably uts forgot what he did, even with his excellent memory. Has no intention of seeing a psychiatrist.  Will explain bruises with, he must have fallen, or hit his head.  <BR>
