  Occupation<BR>
 Hunter<BR>
 Generation Cost:  30 / Experience cost: 90<BR>
 They walk a lonely path.  Scorned by friends and family, they have been the<BR>
objects of ridicule for many a nonbeliever.  But they know what they've seen,<BR>
and they can't deny that to themselves.  Creatures walk among us, forcing us<BR>
to lie to ourselves, to corrupt ourselves, to destroy ourselves.  The hunter<BR>
must find them, they must kill them, or they have failed.  <BR>
 Bonus Skills       Level        Skill Cost<BR>

 Finance            1       Next Level x 3<BR>
 Advantage:  A hunter may choose a single level of Lore, free of charge. <BR>
They also receive a +2 to any mastery resistance roll granted by having level<BR>
2 lore in the breed of their aggressor, and +4 to any mastery resistance roll<BR>
by having level 3 lore in the breed of their aggressor.<BR>
 <BR>
  Special Abilities<BR>
  <BR>
 <BR>
 Adrenaline - 0 Soul to use. (##Adrenaline##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to<BR>
perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting<BR>
cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front<BR>
of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a<BR>
simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8<BR>
(must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to<BR>
mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per<BR>
night.<BR>
 <BR>
 Luck - 0 Soul to use.  (##LuckRe-roll##)<BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / Instant; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
 Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get<BR>
them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the<BR>
tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may<BR>
re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll<BR>
more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is,<BR>
regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per<BR>
night.<BR>
 <BR>
 The Gift - 0 Soul to use. (no room command needed) <BR>
 System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
 Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem<BR>
naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing,<BR>
it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill<BR>
at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points<BR>
to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill<BR>
must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you<BR>
purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus<BR>
that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted<BR>
by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your<BR>
Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character<BR>
generation. (Note, Evasion, Reflexes and Sure Shot are classified as Combat<BR>
Skills).  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift<BR>
unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is<BR>
automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its<BR>
current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the<BR>
Gift.<BR>
