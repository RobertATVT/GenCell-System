</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Animal Mimicry</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use. (##<animal> form##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / Unlimited; takes 2 turns to shape shift<BR>
Effect/Description:  This spell enables the lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form.  Please send requests to <A HREF="mailto: BBSTMail">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9>.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Healing</B> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Heal##)<BR>
System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 hour to cast<BR>
Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a full hour to cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will for the lamia to start over a gain.  The lamia must role-play the hour long casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Meditation</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Meditation##)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><B>Night Vision</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (##Nightvision##)<BR>
System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast<BR>
Effect/Description:  The lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Born in Ireland to the parents of Talia Priest and James Priest on January 1st, 1975.  They moved to Boston Mass. early though when Jessica was only about 3 or 4, seeking a better life for their child.  Soon her father found a job and she went to school.  It wasn't till she was in middle school she found something that interested her.  She had heard a myth or two about the Aztec Civilization and decided to read up on it.  Well she read and read on it till she couldn't read anymore.  She read about their sacrafices to their gods and such things and about how certain people in their tribes could perform "magic".  She soon read more of the histories and began to like them.  She was in high school about her sophmore year, about 16, before she became interested in the Toltec's Civilization.  She read about them and their form of magic and their rituals and such things.  About their gods and such things.  Well soon she graduated from high school and went to college when she was about 19.  She studied the field in which she loved so much history on the Aztecs and other civilizations that came before and after the other two civilizations.  She also took a course or two on the strange blood cults and such things of the far east.  Well soon she completed her courses and graduated with honors from college when she was about 24.  Hearing wild stories of strange occurances in a small town called volletta she decided to perhaps learn just a bit more about the theory on the folk lore she had learned on magicians and such things.  So after a year of earning enough money she went down the the quaint town of volletta.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> </FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
