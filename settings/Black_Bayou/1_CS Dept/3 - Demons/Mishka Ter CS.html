System/Duration:  NA/NA; takes 1 round to shapeshift<BR>
Effect/Description:  A demon is capable of forcing its true form upon its mortal host body.  A demon that assumes  the locust form will rip free from its host body, physically.  Their skin will crack and split, falling off of the demon in a macabre display.  A typical demon in its locust form stands about 9 feet tall.  Its skin is a deep reddish tint with long, stringy black hair.  The body is covered in a hard carapace that helps protect it from physical harm.  Its black lips curl up from the sickly-yellowed fangs as its eyeless sockets stare on.  Black, leathery wings sprout from its back, enabling it to fly at a speed of 25 mph.  Once the demon releases its locust form, the beast will shimmer slightly as the host's flesh slowly begins to reappear over the creature's features and it returns to its moral form.  Locust form grants the demon +3 body and gives it the ability to fly (as described above).<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a demon is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the demon will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Mind vs TN 22 / 10 minutes; takes 1 round to activate<BR>
Effect/Description:  A demon, being a part of the lord of lies himself, is capable of picking out any attempts of deception directed at it.  This is effective against anyone who attempts to lie to the demon.  They must immediately IM the demon's player with the truth behind their lie.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><B>Healing</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8></B> - 0 Soul to use.  (no room command needed)<BR>
System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: Demons have an incredible natural healing ability.  Any wound caused to the demon or its host body will heal at the rate of 1 Body per hour the character rests.  If the character takes any strenuous action, the healing is disrupted and the hour starts over.  A Room Host must be notified when you claim your Body point back.  Wounds created by faith water cannot be healed with this mastery.  Wounds from fire heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play until the damage is healed).  The damage from an attack that removes a limb heals at the normal rate, but the player must role-play the limb slowly growing back.  (Length of time for the limb to regenerate is determined by the <A HREF="mailto:ANTEmail 2">Forum Director</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>

System/Duration:  NA/NA<BR>
Effect/Description: By concentrating on a chosen target, the demon is capable of speaking directly to the creature's mind.  Mortals are unable to return the thoughts.  The target must be within view of the demon attempting to communicate in this fashion.  Mindspeak can only be used to speak to one individual at a time.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Unlike the summer people that she entertains, Mishka Terentyitch is created of autumn hues.  Sanguine curls tumble in a heavy mass to frame the heart-shaped face before they trail down her back to where they drape in a thick curtain at the top of her waist.  Eyes as pale as the sky during the Siberian winter are prisoner by long curling lashes.  The nose is aquiline in its make and the lips that rest beneath have a delightful fullness to them while they are often turned into an engaging smile that seems to draw one in.  Pale as snow given the curving shape of feminine ideals, she stands somewhat above average height and is often hard to miss in a crowd of onlookers.  Her voice is a whisked alto that has a slight accent to it though from just where one would be hard pressed to say.  Her laughter is merry, bright, and often as she finds there is much in the world that amuses her.  While in the off season her dress is casual enough, though her clothing varies from the mundane to the exotic.    <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Born into a world of bright lights where barkers call out to the people to test their strength and win a doll for their sweethearts, Mishka has known no other life than that which the carnival brings.  Raised amoung tattooed men, acrobats, and stage magicians, it's no surprise that she never left the life that her parents brought her into, a life that they lead before she was even a thought in their minds.  Born in March of 1974 to Mikael Terentyitch and Isobelle Dupois, she claims neither heritage as her own, casting off Russian and French for that which can only be called American.<BR>
     She has never had formal schooling, taking instead her lessons from a hard life of travel and experience.  Though this is not to say that she doesn't have an intellect, for she does, but in her mind the realities of everyday living outweigh any that have been scribed into a book.  For Mishka the carnival is all that she has ever needed to know of life, death, love and hate.  She's witnessed the realm of human joy which turns to sorrow, for even if they are considered to be the shysters of America, the people of the Midway still have their own epics that evolve and spin out over time.  Shown by those who know, the mediums and tarot readers, she has found over the years that she too possess this talent, though she is very reluctant to show it off.<BR>
     From the youngest age, she has was a curious child that wished to know how everything worked and the reasons behind it all.  The curiosity was fostered by the family of carny workers that looked at the young girl as being theirs with no set of adults to truly claim her as their own.  Skilled in different aspects of entertainment from bareback trick riding to throwing daggers to basic accounting and finances it is no wonder that the owner of the carnival came to her and offered a business partnership.  The name of Vincent and Terentyitch has become well known in the circles that they move in and a great respect has grown for the red haired woman who will work along side the ticket girls or watch over the sickly children of performers.  She has made her mark and has every intent of one day buying out the old man that is her partner.<BR>
     When the last days of summer approach, she and her motley family part ways until the next spring when they meet again to journey back out into the small towns and larger cities to offer themselves as pieces of history and folklore alike.  Such is the time now, when Mishka finds herself looking to the south and a place to winter until it is time to move on.  The place she has decided upon is Isle Voletta.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8><BR>
