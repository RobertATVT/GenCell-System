  System/Duration: </B>2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene; takes 2 round to activate.<B><BR>
  Effect/Description: </B>A master of mimicry can learn to focus their shape shifting abilities on others.  By picturing the animal and forcing their will, the Mentor can change the shape of the victim to the animal they chose.  The Mentor must speak an elaborate incantation that the victim can hear while making eye contact.  The incantation is meant as a sort of hypnotic phrase while the eye contact opens the victim to the Mentor's will.  The only limitation is that the animal must be on the Animal Form List in the local category.  While the victim is forced into this alternate physical form, they are clear thinking and rational.  However, they are unable to speak orally, use any kind of mental mastery or change into any other form, if they are normally able due to their breed.  The penalties of communication and mental masteries are still in effect.  The first round of activation is spent speaking the incantation and the second round is the actual shape shifting.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><BR>

  System/Duration: </B>Ritual / 24 hours; takes 5 minutes to activate.<B><BR>
  Effect/Description: </B>What breeds independent humans also breeds corruption.  At times, the Mentor may need to reprimand one of their students.  The worst punishment that could befall a lamia is the loss of their spell casting abilities.  This mastery goes a step further.  When the coven joins together, they encircle the victim.  The coven recites an ancient phrase repeatedly throughout the casting.  The Mentor then identifies the victim and calls their crimes out over the chanting of the coven.  The ritual is complete after a period of 5 minutes when the victim is completely stripped of all magical ability for the next 24 hours.  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

       Effect/Description:  This spell enables the lamia to shape shift into one type of small<BR>
       animal.  This would include, but is not limited to: dogs, cats, mice, etc.  This form must be chosen at the time of character creation.  Other animal types may be purchased at a cost of 5 Generation Points or 25 XP later on per form.  The animal form you choose must be approved by the Rules Coordinator or Forum Director.  No form of spell casting is possible while in an animal form. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

While a lamia is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the lamia will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=9><BR>

       System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Instant; takes 1 hour to cast<BR>
       Effect/Description:  When this spell is successfully cast, the lamia will heal at an incredible rate.  Upon successfully casting this spell, the lamia heals 1 Body for each point over 20 they make on the activation roll, unless the wounds were created by fire or salt water.  Wounds created by salt water cannot be healed with this spell.  Fire wounds heal at the rate of 1 Body per day and only when the character sleeps.  If the character is woken up before the day is over, the healing process is disrupted and they do not regain their point (which means they cannot role-play more than the casting of this spell until the damage is healed).  If fire wounds aren't healed with this spell they will take twice as long to heal than normal.  The spell takes a full hour to cast and the lamia must be undisturbed for the entirety of the casting.  Any distractions will for the lamia to start over a gain.  The lamia must role-play the hour long casting of this spell in the main room.<BR>

       System/Duration:  NA / NA; takes 30 minutes to activate<BR>
       Effect/Description:  In order to center themselves and replenish their mystical energies after spell casting, a lamia needs to shut themselves off from the world around them and meditate.  To accomplish this, they must be sitting alone and relaxing, concentrating on a candle flame, or some sort of talisman - perhaps chanting.  The meditation must be role-played for the full 30 minutes in the main room.  If they are interrupted (legitimately) for even a moment, the meditation must begin anew.  1 Soul Point may be regained each half-hour, going no higher than the original level.<BR>

       System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to cast<BR>
       Effect/Description:  The lamia can see twice as far as a normal human can. In addition, when the lighting is low, or near total darkness, the vision of the lamia takes on the effects of infravision.  In total darkness, this mastery is useless.  Unable to make out detail, the lamia can discern between animate and inanimate objects, sensing their red or blue glow, respectively.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

  Generation Cost: 15 / Experience Cost: 75<BR>
  System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 24 / scene; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
  Effect/Description:  One of the Lamia's greatest abilities is the power over gravity itself, allowing the Lamia the gift of flight.  There are two separate spells intertwined in this singular one.  <BR>
  <BR>
     Solo flight:  This costs 1 Soul and allows the Lamia to fly unaided.  The Lamia can never fly faster than 25 miles an hour and cannot carry anything over ten pounds. <BR>
  <BR>
     Enchanted Flight: This costs 2 Soul and allows the Lamia to transfer the power of flight into an inanimate object - some of the most common being brooms and carpets.  The Lamia cannot empower any object weighing more than ten pounds.  The empowered object will fly where the Lamia wishes, though the Lamia doesn't have to be in direct contact with the object, they must remain concentrating on it.  Conversation is possible, but not even walking will be allowed.  This empowered object is capable of carrying passengers, depending on the size of the object - as passenger weight doesn't effect the magic, space does.  Common sense prevails here, but if you aren't sure ask the Room Host or ST on how many passengers can fit.  The object also doesn't need to be in sight, as the Lamia can 'see' from the object itself.  If the Lamia loses concentration the object will lose the gift of flight and will gently fall to the ground, much like a feather.  This has been built into the spell due to past Lamia's dying horrible deaths as their objects crashed to the earth.  The object will retain some aspects of magic if dropped into water (it will float) or even fire (has protection as long as the passengers don't leave the object) as there is a small 'bubble' of protection around the passengers.  However, passengers can still be effected by blows, shot, stabbed and even hit with arrows.  In both versions of the mastery, the protective sphere prohibits items from exiting the bubble (These include but are not limited to physical objects and the effects of masteries)  Think - things can go in, but things can't go out.<BR>

              System/Duration:  2d6+Will vs. victim's 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to cast.<BR>
              Effect/Description:  The lamias magic is a physical manifestation of the collected force of the *mind*.  Stasis is air constriction.  A lamia molds it with their mind.  This spell causes the air around a victim to compress itself tightly.  The duration of the mastery is 4 rounds.  The first round, the victim is completely immobilized, the compressed air holding them tightly.  For the following three rounds, the victim can barely move.  Their Attack and Quickness modifiers are -8 for the duration.<BR>

                       Effect/Description:  This spell enables the Lamia to flawlessly detect the true nature of a target.  She will instantly know what the individuals breed is if they have the lore, if not, they will only know if the person is living or dead.  The individual must IM the Lamia with the truth if the Lamia wins the roll.  *Demons using Soul Mask, will reflect the breed being masked and not the nature of the demon. (Level 3 lore required)<BR>

                      Effect/Description: The lamia has learned to seek others out by manipulating their spell: Mindspeak.       This allows the lamia to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after t the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the lamia is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the lamia must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

  Effect/Description:  Through the use of powerful magic and ages of practicing, Lamia have the ability to magick their clothing to change with them.  When they return to their human form, they will once again be wearing clothing.  Only cloth will work with this mastery as other materials will not blend with the shape changer and fall to the ground.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

      System/Duration:  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 26 / Scene; takes 2 rounds to cast.<BR>
      Effect/Description: This is the truest measure of a lamia's shape altering powers.  The ability to shift their material forms in such a way that enables them to assume an ethereal "spirit-like" quality.  They become translucent/ghostlike - being able to pass through solid objects.  The lamia can solidify at will, although once they do the lamia must recast the spell to become spirit again.  While in spirit form, the lamia is immune to physical attacks of any kind and can only be effected by mental masteries and only if they can be seen.  Lamia in this state are incapable of affecting the physical world in any way.  This means they cannot be heard, smelled or felt, only visible as a soft outline of the individual casting the spell.  The lamia is still affected by the all powerful force of gravity, so cannot float or fly.  The lamia must have both hands free to cast this spell and can have no more than the clothes on their backs for it to work properly.  The lamia is unable to use any masteries or skills at all while in this form.  The only thing the lamia is able to do is move, see and think.  Lama in spirit form may see and follow others in spirit form, transcendent states or astral projections.  They may not interact with them in any way, however.<BR>

                     Effect/description:  Through the use of this spell, the lamia can electrically charge an item to deliver a shock upon touch.  This spell causes the static electricity in the air around the item to spark when another object comes into contact with it.  This spark causes -1 Body damage to anyone who touches the item.  This can be cast on weapons, causing knives to do 2 damage, for instance.  Due to their explosive natures, bullets and shells cannot be charged.  The item must be touched when the charging is cast.

                Effect/Description:  By concentrating on the electricity in the air, the lamia can cause it to sizzle and pop, actually causing physical damage to the victim.  Additionally, this jolts the consciousness of the victim and this spell is used primarily to subdue.  The damage caused by this spell is -1 Body -2 Mind.  The victim must be within line of sight to be effected.<BR>

      Effect/Description:  This spell enables the lamia to summon lightning from the storm clouds above to strike a specific victim.  A storm must be present in order for the lamia to summon lightning.  A round of concentration is required to summon the lightning.  On the next round, the energies are harnessed and the lamia has control over the lightning as a loud thunderclap is heard directly overhead.  During the third round, the lamia may send forth the bolt from the heavens to the intended victim.  The damage for lightning bolt is -6 Body.  The target must be within line of sight to be targeted for a Lightning attack.  The intended victim is allowed to add their evasion skill to their defense roll if applicable.<BR>

      Effect/Description:  Throughout time, magicians have always been able to "create things out of thin air".  Most of these stage magicians rely on illusion to fool their audience.  True lamia can sometimes pull matter from the spirit world, molding it into a physical object.  The object that is created must be rather small, no larger than a 2 liter bottle.  The lamia must reach behind something to create the item.  I.E. reaching into a top hat to pull out a rabbit or reaching behind someone's ear to retrieve a quarter.  After the duration of the spell, the item will dematerialize instantly.  Chemical compositions, such as explosives, cannot be created with this spell. </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

               Effect/Description:  By casting this spell, negative forces fill the lamia's limbs with eerie black electrical energies.  This allows the lamia to cause damage simply by touch.  A loud popping sound is heard as contact is made.  If successful causes 1 damage to body.  If used with hand to hand attack: an extra 1 damage is added.  Also upon touching the victim, the lamia causes intense pain, sickness, boils, seeping abscesses, etc. in the victim.
