</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>So you want to run the wilds with the pack?  You must learn the ways first, you must feel the strength.  A Loup Garou is a mortal given the most scant amount of the wolven Virus, not enough to change him for the spritual ritual is missing from them.  This creates a member of the pack free from the curse.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>  When a wolf bites a mortal after summoning the virus he creates a Loup Garou.  In order to create the Loup Garou the werewolf must successfully bite the Mortal and summon the Virus by rolling 2d6+Soul vs. the targets 2d6+body.  Once this is done the Mortal will enter a Euphoric state, seeing the spirits of his creators past and that of his new family.  If the Soul roll is failed the wolf must roll his Will vs. TN:24 in order to stave off the frenzy that ensues after a failed creation.  If the werewolf fails this roll he will attack the target until one of them is dropped to 0 body.  If the Mortal is dropped the werewolf will immediately run off and flee the area.  If the werewolf is dropped, however, it is up to the whims of the target. A Werewolf can only make 1 such attempt on any single mortal per night and may only create only one Loup Garou at any given week.  This sharing of the virus will last for 1 week.  Once the week is up, the mortal loses the bonus of the Sharing immediately.  This causes severe depression and a constant sense of exhaustion in the mortal as the energy of the virus leaves them.  All rolls for the following week after a Sharing ends and is not renewed are at -4.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Werewolf will lose -3 from their Mind stat for the rest of the night after a Sharing, successful or not.  They will regain these points as they heal overnight.  This only happens the first time they Share with the target, additional sharings do not require as much of the virus.  Sharings are allowed once a week, but the Loup Garou is allowed to resist at each sharing.  Each successive sharing gives the Werewolf a closer "bond" on you, therefore providing the Werewolf with a +1 to their roll.  This modifier is cumulative.  At the end of one week the Werewolf must re-share with the Loup Garou and roll again. This Sharing process must be posted.<BR>
<BR>
A Werewolf can have no more than 1 Loup Garou at any given time<BR>

So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or almost two weeks.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e., a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, or stiffness, or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / Instant<BR>
Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.  The mortal can only enact this mastery twice per night.<BR>

System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>
