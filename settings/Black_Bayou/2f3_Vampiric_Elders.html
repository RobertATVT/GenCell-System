When creating a new vampire family, there are a few things one should first consider.  Isle Voletta is a good sized island, but the city of Voletta is not all that large.  Vampires rely on their human population in order to survive, therefore that population determines how many vampire families there can be before overpopulation puts serious demands on the feeding stock as well as put them in greater danger of having their breed discovered.  Voletta is large enough for five vampire families with no more than 13 members.  If a family member tries to produce a 14th member, the attempt will automatically result in a rogue vampire as the blood has thinned too much - even if the attempt was made by the Elder.<BR>
<BR>
If there is enough room for a new family, the Elder-to-be must meet a few requirements.  They must have played an approved vampire character sheet for a minimum of 6 months and have Lore level 3 in Vampire.  In order to maintain their Elder status, they must roleplay for a minimum of 5 days during each update period.  Also, in order to attempt another family, the Elder-to-be must have sired four children of their own.  An Elder's power comes mostly from the combined energies of its children.  The more vampires they surround themselves with that share the same blood, the more power the Elder has.  The Blood of the Elders children strengthen and fortify them allowing them to rise above the normal vampire.  Like the age old adage the closer to the bone, the sweeter the meat, the same applies to the Elders.  His own children are his power, but Lo to the Elder who allows his children to build their own blood lines, for herein lies their greatest peril.  As the strength of his children serve to make the Elder what he is, he cannot permit his children to build their own power base.<BR>
<BR>
When an Elder's child creates their own child, the Elder still benefits, but to a lesser extent.  The child acts as a blood "clot" between the Elder and the grandchild.  The child, of course, benefits the most from the them.  Grandchildren also count toward this family member total, though the amount of power they return to the Elder is significantly less than the child.  The child acts as a barrier, blocking a direct flow of power to the Elder, keeping most of it for themselves.  <BR>
<BR>
When a child creates 5 or more children, they become a threat to the Elder.  At that point, the child has accumulated enough "blood power" to break free of the blood ties of their Elder.  If there are less than 5 families total, the child that broke free may apply for Elder status.  If not, they simply lead a coven of rogue vampires.  Of course, the Elders who would sit by and let this happen are few and far between.  It is the rogue vampires that are the greatest threat to any vampire society.<BR>
<BR>
Either way, to create the family, the player of the Elder must submit a Breed Leader Request to</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>BBSTMail</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Once approved, the Elder will have access to the Elder mastery list and have their own page set up in the main boards.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Rogue Vampires</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
Vampires who do no belong to any established family are considered Rogues.  They are often found in cities where the vampire population exceeds the mortal limitations.  They generally cause a strain on the vampire families and there are tales of famine throughout vampiric history.  The human population overall has increased to an extent that famine is unlikely these days, rogue vampires present other problems as well.<BR>
<BR>
Rogue vampires who lead groups do not gain the same benefits as the traditional Elders of vampiric families do.  They also lack the social prestige of leading a family.  These two factors are usually enough to inspire even the youngest of rogues to vie for power.  This means one of the established vampiric families have to be removed to make room for themselves.  Obviously, this tends to lead from political maneuvering, manipulation to the occasional terroristic attacks and so on.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>When Children Die</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
If a child dies while they still belong to the Elder's family, all of their grandchildren automatically become the children of the Elder, or the next highest vampire on the blood chain.  For instance:<BR>
<BR>
Elder<BR>
   Child 1<BR>
   Child 2<BR>
       GChild 1<BR>
       Gchild 2<BR>
          GGchild 1<BR>
   Child 3<BR>
<BR>
If GChild 2 were to die, their child, "GGchild 1" would become the child of Child 2 because that is the next parent on the blood chain on the way to the elder.  If Child 2 were dead or was to die, then GGchild 1 would become the child of Elder, as would GChild 1.  If the Elder dies, then Child1 would become the new Elder as soon as they can send in their next update.<BR>

Effect/Description: </B>The head of a vampire family has a great amount of control over those brought into the fold.  The originator of the blood that both killed and resurrected them acts as a link to their master.  The family head can reach out and compel one of their blood to return to them, even over great distances.  This form of beckoning will cause the affected vampire to do whatever they can to join their master, even at great risk to their own unlife.  The called vampire will immediately cease all activity and travel with great haste to their master's side.  Once they have been affected, there is no way to escape the call.  In addition, this mastery enables the family head to sense whenever one of their children sire a new vampire.  This knowledge is gained instantly at the moment of creation.  The siring vampire must email the family head immediately informing them or they may risk OOC penalties.  The bond is not fool proof, however.  Should the victim not be online, then they are immune to the mastery.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; Instant.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>With a moment of concentration, and prior to the Elder falling unconscious, the family head with this mastery will cause the membranes and tissue of their own heart to strengthen tenfold, nearly taking on the consistency of stone.  This makes the family head nearly impossible to stake.  If all the requirements of a Lore 3 staking attempt is made, you must also roll 2d6+Body+Athletics vs victim's 2d6+Body+Athletics (the Body is the victims particular max, not what they currently hold). This roll is a physical attempt to pound the steak through the toughened membranes of the Elder's heart.  Only one attempt can be made to break through.  If the attacker win the roll, the Elder dies.  If the attacker looses the roll, it triggers an unconscious Mass Mindspeak that is transmitted automatically to all of the Elders children normally reachable by such means.  This version of Mindspeak not only pinpoints the Elders current location, but it also works for family members who aren't even online, so Email is okay.  (The scene will not be paused for the Elder to return Email or answer other IMs - this is for an emergency 'send' only)  There are several other benefits to this mastery besides the hardening of the heart.  All long range staking attempts will automatically fail.  The Elder will receive 2 points of free Body loss per round with no effect.  All other damage taken after this 2 Body will effect the Elder normally for the remainder of the round.  This remains in effect for the entire scene once activated.  On the downside, Elders receive -4 to their Quickness due to the toughening of their skin and if the elder doesn't make their TN to activate this mastery, they will be stunned for one round due to shock on their heart and are unable to attempt it again for 5 rounds after that. <BR>

System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 24 / Instant; takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>Among having mastered the blood that is their line, some family heads have also mastered the darkness with which they live.  With but a thought, the family head can mold its very substance to that of shadow.  They will appear translucent as their skin takes a shade of pitch black.  Their facial and other distinguishing features vanish as their bodies become two dimensional.  The family head can shrink and enlarge itself at will.  While in a shadowy form, the vampire is unable to affect any physical object or person.  Likewise, they are unaffected by any form of physical attack or contact.  Mental masteries, sunlight and holy water will continue to affect the shadowy vampire, however.  Another benefit of this mastery is the ability to meld with the shadows around them.  A family head can literally become one with a shadow and travel along it from end to end, completely undetected.  If the shadows of two objects cross, they are able to move from one shadow to the next.  The family head must be in shadow form to travel in this manner.  While traveling across shadows, the family head is completely undetectable, unless they choose to be visible.  A bright light, such as that of a flashlight, that hits the family head will pull them from their shadow form immediately returning them to their normal physical state.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=8>(Just a quick note about shape changing (all forms).  While a vampire is in another form, if its current Body falls to 0, the vampire will immediately change back to mortal form minus the damage it has already taken, leaving a minimum of 1 Body.  It should also be noted that materiel objects do not shapeshift with the character.  Any and all clothes and objects the character was holding will need to be transported by some other means.)<BR>

System/Duration:  </B>roll 2d6+Will vs victim's 2d6+Will / Scene (see below); takes 1 round to activate.<B><BR>
Effect/Description: </B>At times, a show of power is required to persuade a reluctant child into obedience.  Being the master of the bloodline, the family head has great control over the life force presiding within their children.  With sheer force of will, the family head can speed up the atoms within the blood of the victim, causing it to heat up.  Within seconds, the blood will begin to boil causing unbearable agony and damage within the victim.  Those struck with this mastery immediately suffer 4 points of damage to both Body and Mind.  Additionally, due to the lingering pain and discomfort, all die rolls for the remainder of the scene made by the child are halved.  The victim must be within line of sight for a family head to inflict their wrath upon them.  Wrath may not be used more than once on the same individual per night.<BR>
