</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>A mastery is what science would calls an extraordinary feat in a mortal being.  These are the abilities that set mortals apart, in strength, intellect and faith.  Every mortal has the potential for power, but it is a small few who learn to tap into it.  Fewer still are the ones who learn to master them.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

The role-played effects of certain masteries can last a lot longer than the combat effects.  Also listed here is the number of rounds it takes to activate the mastery.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the time your character tries to use a mastery, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  To some, nature bestows special gifts.  These people have the unique ability of using both hands equally well.  The character may take 2 attacks per round, one with each hand.  These attacks are limited to small bladed, small arms, non-lethal attacks and hand-to-hand fighting, as the rest of the skills tend to require the use of two hands.  The attack made with the regular hand is rolled normally and the attack made with the second hand is made with -4 to attack.  The defender is allowed to dodge normally, taking a -2 penalty for each attack after the first for the round.  i.e. If DavisMason is dodging this mortal as his first dodge for the round, he dodges the first attack normally.  The dodge for the second attack is at -2.  Each dodge after that suffers a -2 penalty as normal.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>Ever notice how, just when the hero is going down, they make an amazing come back and strikes a blow for truth, justice, and the American way?  How about the bad guy that always comes back for one final scare? The ability to return from the brink of death is possessed by some Mortals. When the Mortal takes enough damage to take his Body statistic past 0, the character's will to live will drain it's inner force in order to survive.  No roll is required, but the mortal's Body must first reach -1 for this mastery to begin.  The Mortal loses 1 Soul and gains 1 Body.  This will work until the Mortal has either drained all its current Soul or returned to a current body of 1.  This ability may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  When faced with danger, Mortals have developed the so-called 'Fight-or-Flight' response, basically a surge of epinephrine to enhance strength and reduce reaction time. Mortals who have taken this 'Fight-or-Flight' response to the next step, i.e. Mortals who have purchased this mastery have controlled their response to only the Flight portion. Upon activation of this mastery, the Mortal has focused his concentration enough to allow him a better chance to elude those seeking to harm them, granting them a +4 to his quickness while escaping. However, the normal time limits on escape must be followed.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  NA / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Haidee was the only woman ever truly loved by Don Juan.  Imagine the greatest of lovers only truly opening his heart to one woman at a time.  Such is the power of love.  A force sometimes as strong as the tides.  Sometimes as steady as a mountain.  Based upon this connection that some Mortals have for those they love deeply, they sometimes are able to sense danger almost on a psychic level to their loved one.  The sensing takes the form of a vision, that seems to flash across the lover's eyes.  These visions occur at anytime the loved one feels an extreme emotion.  Hate, fear, happiness, and lust are only examples.  They will know exactly what is happening to their loved one, though they will not know any details except for a 30 second flash of seeing through the eyes of the loved one. Also, should someone attack the object of the Mortal's Haidee, their love will be channeled into a blind rage.  If the lover focuses their soul on the rage, they gain +4 to all attack rolls for the remainder of the scene. This bonus is only applicable after a physical attack causing damage to the Beloved, which is witnessed by the Mortal visually or via their 30 second vision.  The loved one must be stated during character creation, or role-played over a month's time in the game.  Should either loved one die, the Haidee is lost and has to be purchased again.  When repurchased, state the SN of your loved one next to this masteries title.<BR>

This bonus also works when trying to notice something hidden (including Dispas, Shadow Manipulation, surprise attacks, etc.).<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  In intense situations, the human soul is known to manifest itself during desperate times of need.  During times of intense fear or when faith is the only thing they have left, mortals tend to reach deep down into places they didn't even know existed and harnessing this energy from everything that makes them mortal.  As a result, the player may add +8 to the next Faith roll their character makes (only applies when a the Faith skill is used).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B> see below / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Every once and awhile, someone comes along who is so exceptionally gifted at something that their ability far exceeds anyone else's.  This mastery allows the player to temporarily add +3 to the skill that was selected for their Gift.  The player must roll 2d6 + the stat of the skill being increased.  The target number for the roll is 16.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill makes the character a Phenom.  This skill may only be used once per night.<BR>

System/Duration:</B>  2d6+Will vs. 2d6+Will / 4 rounds or 2 minutes; takes 1 round to activate. <BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> Some mortals seem to be blessed with a natural affinity toward animals.  With the use of this mastery, a mortal can calm an animal and befriend him for a time, be it wild or tame.  Simple, one word verbal commands given to the animal will be understood.  The duration can be extended with the expenditure of extra soul, no re-roll is necessary.  Shepherd's Aura has the potential to affect a breed while it is in an animal form, including Horus.  In any case, if the roll is against a player character, then the roll is vs the targets 2d6+Will.  These feelings tend to carry over to the mortal form and are viewed as "good vibes."<BR>

System/Duration: </B> 2d6+Body+Music vs. victim's 2d6+Mind+Soul / Instant; this takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> For ages, music's soothing quality has been known to calm both humans and beasts.  Some musicians have learned to harness this quality of music, especially in their endeavors with those creatures of the night.  Any character which succumbs to the effect may not make any aggressive actions.  This includes attacking and using aggressive masteries or spells.  Although they <U>will</U> defend themselves, even though defending may potentially harm another.  If the player using this has lore level 3 for whatever breeds are affected, then those in their "true" breed form will revert back to their "mortal" form.  The player may not choose who is effected.  All characters who hear the music are affected.  The single die roll made by the musician above is compared to the rolls of all the individuals who are within hearing range (50 feet outside or the same room inside) to determine who is affected.  Meaning they may make no other actions, aggressive, defensive, or otherwise until the mastery has lost its effect.  The user may choose to end the mastery prematurely at the end of any round before the next wave of initiative begins.  On the other hand, the user may need stop the use of the mastery to defend themselves.  These effects are subtle and the victims will have no idea the music created the effect unless the musician is obvious about their intentions.  Remember that Steel Will is added to all Will rolls in the game.</HTML>
