</U>Hi There! </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>I'm <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>and I am here to answer the 10 most Frequently Asked questions about Experience Points here in Black Bayou.<B><I><BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12></I>1. How do I earn XPs?</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>You can earn your Experience points in four different ways. <B>First</B>, Role-play in the room. Any night you spend an hour or more in the room interacting IC (in character), you earn a point. If you have more than one character and you play each one separately for an hour, you earn a point for each. <B>Second</B>, Posting, any IC post or response in the folders of the Black Bayou Message Boards will earn you between one and five points of experience. There is <B>a maximum of 7 points </B>possible each week. Third, Player recommendations, if another player recommends your role-playing or posts, you can earn extra XPs. These recommendations are held until the end of the month and awarded then. Fourth, Departmental recommendations, the Storyline and Rules department sends in recommendations at the end of the month for exceptional suggestions. These are compiled and sent out with the Player recommendations.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>2. How do I know how many XPs I have?</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
It is your responsibility to keep track of your points. Black Bayou works on the honor system, although we do keep logs to check up, if it is necessary. For Awards of any kind, a record is kept for at least 6 months by the current Experience Manager. Just mail a request to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>with the start and end dates for which you want the records. You should receive a response within 2-3 days.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>3. How do I recommend someone for extra XPs?</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>To recommend another player for extra XPs, you send a log of the RP or the name, date, and folder of their post in a letter to the XP Manager. You might want to add why it is so exceptional. <BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>4. When do I get my XPs?</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
<BR>
The <B>Post experience points awards </B>cover 7 days at a time, Friday thru the following Thursday. The Award Letters should reach you by the Sunday after the period that is being awarded. <B>Recommendation awards </B>cover an entire month. Those Award Letters will go out, usually by the 2nd of the month following the one the awards are for. <B>Example</B>: HayesJM has earned the maximum of 10 pts for the month of June. He will receive that Award Letter by July 2nd.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>5. How do I know for WHICH posts the points were awarded?</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
You don't. Points are awarded on a scale of one to five for every IC post and IC response on the boards. There are currently over 500 posts being written for these boards every week. Awards letters are being send out to about 125 players a week. We just don't have the man power to keep track of how many each post earned. Also we stop counting at 7 for each week, so some incredible post written later in the week might seem to have gotten only one point. If you are awarded points, take a look at what you wrote for that week, and you will get a rough idea for which posts those points were awarded.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>6. What rating system is used on the posts?</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>Below is a copy of the rating system sent out to the readers.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>Rating Scale:</B></I><BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> 1. Just a post not much info ... or a fair IC response<BR>
 2. Post with good info ... or a good short IC response<BR>
 3. Post with good info & fair style ... or a great IC response<BR>
 4. Post with good info & good style ... or an incredible IC response<BR>
 5. Oh-my-goodness knock-your-socks-off post ... <B>VERY RARE</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>7.  I didn't post at all...where did these points come from?</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>If you receive points and you are unsure of their origin, ask the people you played with if they posted logs of your RP. Well edited logs make wonderful reading...and if you are in them you are awarded points for your part in the writing of a great scene.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>8. I posted but didn't get any points ... what do I do? </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>First, check the date and make sure that you are more than 2 days past the posting period in question. Second, look at the dates on your last awards and the dates of your posts to check what period those posts fall into. Last, if you have checked the dates and you are sure you have been overlooked, send the names, dates...and the folders in which you posted during that period to <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail">BBST Mail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>. Tell them that you think something has been over looked and they will look into it. If an error has been made, cause we BBSTs are human too, it will be cleared up and you will be awarded the points you have earned.<BR>
