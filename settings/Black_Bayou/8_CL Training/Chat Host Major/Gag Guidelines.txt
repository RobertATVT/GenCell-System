<B>Advertising</B><BR>
Always educate by directing members to Keyword: CLASSIFIEDS. If the advertising is clearly advertising and the member clearly saw your friendly reminder, it would be appropriate to escalate to an official warn.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Child Lures</B><BR>
While we have no way of knowing the accurate ages of the members participating in our community, and we don't want to warn children for wanting to interact with other children, if we suspect children are being lured by adults into inappropriate discussion or action, we:<BR>
<BR>
	* Take action immediately. If there is enough context to make you suspicious, there is enough reason to act. Do not attempt to educate or divert the violator. This is a situation where we don't take chances. Take action and let the member sort it out with CAT.<BR>
<BR>
	* Issue an official on-screen warn to the member we suspect is luring children.<BR>
<BR>
	* Run a child safety notice in the chat room.<BR>
<BR>
Note that the sample child safety macros below are very long. While we generally ask that Community Leaders keep macros to 3 lines or less, in these situations it may be desirable to scroll the inappropriate text off the screen and away from the potential victim's eyes.<BR>
<BR>
Kids, AOL has millions of members and,<BR>
like any large city, everyone needs to be<BR>
a little careful here. If someone says<BR>
something to you in the room, in IM,<BR>
or in e-mail that makes you feel *unsafe*,<BR>
tell your parents and tell AOL at<BR>
Keyword: Notify AOL.<BR>
<BR>
Do NOT give out your full real name<BR>
or the names of your parents.<BR>
Do NOT give out your real address.<BR>
Do NOT give out your phone number.<BR>
Do NOT give out the name of your<BR>
school.<BR>
Have fun here and be safe! :)<BR>
<BR>
<I>What if I have warned a member in this situation and the member then complains that he was only interested in joining younger members in one of the online gaming forums?</I> There are two separate issues here:<BR>
<BR>
1. If you did actually make a mistake and there was no violation, CAT will not uphold the warn, so the member has nothing to worry about. Remember, we aren't the final word on violations. CAT will make the final decision. We can only use our best judgment and we don't take chances when it comes to child safety. Let the member work it out with CAT.<BR>
<BR>
2. We don't discuss warns with the members. If any member complains upon receiving a warn, direct them to Keyword: TOS QUESTIONS.<BR>
<BR>
<I>What if a minor initiates sexual interaction with an adult?</I> The content is likely to be unacceptable, so you can warn for the content. Always run a safety notice.<BR>
<BR>
<I>What if one minor is interacting inappropriately with another minor?</I> Again, the content is likely to be unacceptable, so you can warn for the content. Always run a safety notice.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Copyright Protected Materials</B><BR>
If a member appears to be asking for commercial software, be sure the member knows it is commercial. Let the member know in a friendly manner, "Hey, member, did you know that XYZ is a commercial program that you need to purchase?" Educate before considering a warn.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Disruptive Programs</B><BR>
When a member is promoting use of a program designed to disrupt chat, you should attempt to educate with a friendly reminder before considering a warn. They must be promoting, not just saying they use such a program or discussing use of such a program. <BR>
<BR>
Signature lines generated by punter programs (they contain the word <I>punter</I>) can be warned immediately. Examples of punter program signature lines:<BR>
<BR>
123MEMBER:    `     `GRAFIX Mail Punter  `     `<BR>
123MEMBER:              `     `By:ELiTe  `     `<BR>
123MEMBER:     `     `Loaded By:123MEMBER  `     <BR>
<BR>
123MEMBER:	<=-'[ Cube Punter For AOL 4.0<BR>
123MEMBER:	<=-'[ By: -=[ Cube ÿÿ 1998]=- <BR>
123MEMBER:	<=-'[ Loaded By: 123MEMBER<BR>
<BR>
These chat clips represent a clear effort, on the part of the member using the program, to disrupt the room. The chat must be generated by a program. A chat clip showing a line that is easily typed by a member (i.e., 123Member: my cool punter loaded.) will not be actioned.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Foreign Language</B><BR>
Using a foreign language is not unacceptable and Community Leaders outside the International channel cannot issue official warns to members who they believe are using a foreign language to express unacceptable content. If the situation becomes disruptive, use friendly reminders and educational warns as necessary.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Generally Disruptive Behavior</B><BR>
If the content itself is not unacceptable, but the behavior is causing disruption, you may need to provide up to <B>four (4)</B> examples when reporting the disruption. There are exceptions for specific behaviors that are disruptive if they are done less than four times. You can determine if disruption is occurring by asking yourself these questions:<BR>
<BR>
	1. Is the behavior continually interrupting ongoing discussion?<BR>
	2. Are the members asking the disruptive member to stop?<BR>
	3. Are the members asking you to do something?<BR>
	4. Are other members playing copycat and causing additional disruption?<BR>
	5. Have you reminded the members about using tools like ignore?<BR>
	6. Have you educated the disruptive member about online etiquette?<BR>
	7. Have you attempted to get the disruptive member involved in the discussion?<BR>
	8. Is the disruptive member being abusive?<BR>
	9. Do you have at least 4 examples of the behavior?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Graphics</B><BR>
You may witness ASCII depictions of unacceptable content in chat rooms. These are considered the same as if the content were in words. If the meaning is clearly unacceptable, it's unacceptable content.<BR>
<BR>
You may witness discussions in chat rooms regarding distribution of content. If the member clearly describes the content as unacceptable, then the discussion is unacceptable. For example, members may indicate they are looking for GIFs or JPGs. You have no idea whether or not the files are sexually explicit or otherwise unacceptable. A member asking if anyone has any GIFs is not violating any rules. Files described as <I>hot</I> may be a reference to the file's popularity. A member asking if anyone has any XXX GIFs is clearly looking for sexually explicit material and that discussion would be unacceptable.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Harassment</B><BR>
When reporting harassment of an individual member, the screen name of the member being harassed must be obvious from the chat clip <B>or</B> you must include this information in your report (i.e., in the "Notes:" section of your warn mail):<BR>
<BR>
Harassment of member: <screen name of member being harassed><BR>
<BR>
<I>A member was constantly poked at by another member in a chat room over several sessions. The offender stayed just within the TOS guidelines during each session. Is there anything I can do about it now?</I> If proving harassment requires chat clips from previous chats, it won't be accepted. Delayed reporting does not work. Advise the member being harassed that they may report it at Keyword: NOTIFY AOL and that they should continue to report it each time it occurs.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Can a Host put people on "Ignore" for harassment? Or must I warn?</I> Hosts don't put members on ignore. You need to work harder to draw the member into the chat discussion, educate them about online etiquette, and warn them if necessary.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Harassment Directed at Community Leaders</B><BR>
Generally, you should never warn a member for harassing you, however, if the harassment is persistent and so overwhelming that it seriously impedes your ability to host, and has a negative impact on the room discussion, it is appropriate to issue a warn.<BR>
<BR>
Do your best to educate and divert the member away from unacceptable behavior, and bring them back into the room discussion. If the chat becomes really nasty, it generally progresses to include unacceptable content -- usually vulgarity. At this point you have little choice but to issue an on-screen warn. The best defense against this behavior is usually a bit of self-depreciating humor! Smiling in the face of adversity may be a cliche, but it works!<BR>
<BR>
<B>Impersonation</B><BR>
When reporting a member who appears to be impersonating an AOL employee, Community Leader, celebrity, government official, or another member, use the "Notes:" field of your warn mail to explain who is being impersonated.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Masked Vulgarity</B><BR>
<I>If the member wasn't using a vulgar word, why would he/she need to hide it?</I> The word may be masked for shock value. CAT simply will not uphold the warn if the word is not easily recognizable. Look at the total context in which the comments are made. Could it have been a typo? Err on the side of the member.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Members May Ask</B><BR>
Members may ask about the use of specific words or phrases online. You should answer the question or refer the member to Keyword: TOS QUESTIONS. If the member persists on-screen, ask the member to communicate with you via Instant Message. If the member continues on-screen and you are certain the member is <I>asking</I> questions as a ploy for using unacceptable language, you may determine the member is being intentionally disruptive and warn for the unacceptable behavior. In reporting this to CAT, you will need to include several examples of the behavior to show that the member is intentionally using unacceptable language.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Password Surfing</B><BR>
If password surfing occurs in the chat room, don't waste time warning. Instead, immediately run a password safety macro in the room to educate members about the following points:<BR>
<BR>
	* No AOL employee or volunteer will ever ask for a member's password.<BR>
	* Never give out their passwords under any circumstances.<BR>
	* If a member has given out his/her password, proceed immediately to Keyword: PASSWORD to change their password.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Polling and Age/Sex/Location Checks</B><BR>
This behavior is a common way for members to communicate. The behavior itself is not unacceptable, however, polling can become disruptive if a single member continually polls the room members.<BR>
<BR>
	* Do let folks know that polling can be disruptive. <BR>
	* Do encourage pollers to communicate in other ways. <BR>
	* Do encourage anyone bothered by the poll to use the "Ignore" feature. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Putting Private Information On-Screen</B><BR>
Posting personal information like a phone number to a chat room is unacceptable and may be an official warn on a first instance.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Rolling Dice</B><BR>
If you are not hosting a game room where dice rolling is acceptable, politely remind the member that rolling dice is disruptive, or refer them to areas where it is acceptable.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Screen Names & Profiles</B><BR>
Community Guidelines for content and conduct applies to screen names and profiles. If you see a clearly vulgar or otherwise clearly offensive screen name enter your chat room, issue an official warn with a gag of 60 minutes and report the warn. Do not warn if the name is questionable; report the name at Keyword: NOTIFY AOL > Screen Names & Profiles.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Scrolling</B><BR>
In order to be considered a scroll, at least <B>seven (7)</B> lines must be put to the screen. The lines can be interrupted by other member's chat, but must be close together to be scrolling as opposed to generally disruptive behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<I>What do you do when someone knows the 7 line rules, and stops scrolling at 5 or 6 lines consistently?</I> Instead of looking at this as scrolling, look at this as any disruptive behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sexually Explicit Behavior</B><BR>
<I>In a chat room, if two or more members are not harassing each other nor using vulgarities, but are "virtually undressing" each other in an adult fashion, while ignoring the other chat members' requests to stop, how should this be handled?</I> It sounds as though the language is acceptable, but that the chatting is disruptive. Any behavior that is disrupting to the room is unacceptable. As always, before considering a warn, you should try other methods of correcting the behavior:<BR>
<BR>
 * Remind them that their chat is not appropriate to the community.<BR>
 * Say, ":::covering eyes::: Please don't do that in front of everyone, OK?"<BR>
 * Remind the room members about the "Ignore" feature.<BR>
<BR>
Suggesting that they take their chat to IM or a private room is not recommended. As Hosts, you do not want to give the appearance of condoning potentially unacceptable behavior online.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sign Off Keys</B><BR>
Telling members to press Alt+SS, or Alt+F4, (or Command+Q on a Mac) needs to be done <B>only once</B> to qualify as disruptive.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sounds in the Chat Room</B><BR>
Usually, warns will be issued for repeated playing of system sounds. It is difficult to warn for voluntary sounds, since the members in the room must choose to hear them. Before warning, try educating the member first by telling them where they might find chat rooms that welcome the use of such sounds. Bear in mind that sometimes members will complain that a sound is vulgar. Regardless of the content of a sound file, it can't be warned for vulgarity unless the file name typed to the room is vulgar. If a member is offended, they should delete the file from their system.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Terms Reminder</B><BR>
Please remember not to use the terms "pedophile" or "pornography" or "illegal" or "solicitation of minors" in your warn mail.<BR>
