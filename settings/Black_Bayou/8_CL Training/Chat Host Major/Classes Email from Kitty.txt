My name is Deanna, and I am the Training Manager here in the Antagonist/Zealot areas. :)  <BR>
<BR>
I have been asked to get together with everyone in your area to get you up to date on your classes for Chat Hosting/Message Board Management.<BR>
<BR>
Below is the course information that you will need to register.  Any other questions please holler!<BR>
<BR>
<B>I show you having completed your orientation on 5-3-00 :)</B><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>These classes MUST be taken in your ORIGINAL master screen name on your account. :) That is the one that you signed up for your account with.  It is not the extra 2 names you can designate as masters. :) It would be the one you can NOT delete. :) So it is very important that you put down the correct information for the area you work in.  <BR>
<BR>
Forum/Area:  Antagonist for HOST ANT's, Zealot for ZLTHS :) <BR>
Supervisor's screen name:  For HOST ANT's it would be HOST ANT Kitty and HOST ANTHelix, for ZLTH's It would be HOST ANT Kitty and HOST ZLOT Havoc.  <BR>
<BR>
Last but not least, I need to have you send me your confirmation mails to show that you attended the classes.  Without these I have to wait til the end of each month to update my materials and it makes for a huge mess. :) So PLEASE send me your confirmations as soon as you receive them. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#008000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
