Every Community Leader needs to call for assistance from time to time. This happens on occasion to even the most experienced Community Leaders.<BR>
<BR>
Do not hesitate to seek assistance if you feel you are in the midst of a situation you cannot control. Remember that our primary goal is to provide a pleasant atmosphere in chat for our members. Asking for assistance should not be seen as a failure, but should be viewed as using good judgment and focusing on a positive member experience.<BR>
<BR>
There are two ways to get help:<BR>
<BR>
1. Call for help from your forum's emergency response team. Ask your forum online coordinator what the procedures are for your forum and be ready to use them.<BR>
<BR>
2. Use Keyword: CLPAGER to call a member of the Chat Response Team (a CRT Guide) into your room. CL Pager was put into place to assist you with problems occurring in your chat room while you are hosting.<BR>
<BR>
	* You may only utilize CL Pager while <B>on duty</B> hosting in your chat room and <B>wearing your Community Leader screen name</B>. CL Pager is not to be used to call a Guide at any other times. <BR>
<BR>
	* Be sure to fill out the form completely.<BR>
<BR>
	* If you are empowered/direct reporting, make sure you indicate this when summoning assistance.<BR>
<BR>
	* If you check the "urgent" box, the arriving Guide will immediately assume control of all TOS situations in your room. If you don't check the "urgent" box, the responding Guide will attempt to send you an Instant Message to verify that you need them to take control of TOS issues in the room.<BR>
<BR>
	* Once you've requested that a Guide handle TOS issues in your room, you will<BR>
return to hosting and leave all TOS issues for the Guide to handle until the Guide leaves the room. Return to the topic chat if there is one, continue to greet members, answer questions, and take control of the room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If a Guide happens to drop into your room while you are hosting and you did not call a Guide, you may continue to host and handle TOS issues. The Guide is just visiting and will send you an Instant Message to see if you need anything before they leave the room. If you happen to have a problem in the room and would like the Guide to handle it, let the Guide know by Instant Message, then relinquish TOS responsibility to the Guide as you would if you had called the Guide into the room.<BR>
