Online Etiquette Promos & Reminders<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - In most places on AOL,<BR>
vulgar language or sexually explicit<BR>
conduct are no more appropriate online<BR>
than they would be at Thanksgiving dinner.<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - There is no place on the AOL<BR>
service where hate speech is tolerated.<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - Disrupting the flow of chat<BR>
is online vandalism and ruins the<BR>
experience for others.<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - You may not impersonate<BR>
another member (including celebrities),<BR>
an AOL employee, or a Community Leader.<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - The use of AOL for the<BR>
transmission of sexually explicit materials<BR>
is a violation of AOL's Terms of Service.<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - If you disagree with someone,<BR>
respond to the subject, not the person.<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - You may only place<BR>
advertisements in areas designated for<BR>
that purpose. Try Keyword: CLASSIFIEDS.<BR>
<BR>
Every screen name has a real person<BR>
behind it -- relax and have fun, but<BR>
please try to be friendly. Thanks! :)<BR>
<BR>
Did you know that harassment isn't<BR>
allowed on AOL? Stick to debating the<BR>
issues and avoid name-calling.<BR>
<BR>
<screen name>, that type of language is<BR>
considered offensive in this room. Please<BR>
try not use it. Thanks. :)<BR>
<BR>
If you would like to be treated with respect,<BR>
remember to treat others the same way.<BR>
<BR>
<screen name>, if you want to get to know<BR>
people, talk to them here like you do offline.<BR>
<BR>
Instead of asking everyone's age and sex,<BR>
try to find out WHO people are instead.<BR>
It can be a LOT more interesting!<BR>
<BR>
Folks, please remember that the Terms of<BR>
Service and Community Guidelines are in<BR>
effect at all times. Thanks!<BR>
<BR>
Need a refresher on online etiquette?<BR>
Read AOL's Terms of Service and<BR>
Community Guidelines at Keyword: TOS.<BR>
<BR>
If you have questions about which words<BR>
are permitted on AOL, please use Keyword: TOS<BR>
and click the "Questions" button there.<BR>
<BR>
If you have any concerns about the<BR>
TOS warning, please write to the<BR>
Community Action Team by sending<BR>
e-mail to TOSGeneral.<BR>
<BR>
Did you know you shouldn't give out or<BR>
ask for personal information in chat rooms?<BR>
This includes phone numbers, full names,<BR>
and addresses. Stay safe online! :)<BR>
<BR>
If another member makes you feel<BR>
uncomfortable, don't engage in<BR>
one-on-one chat with that person.<BR>
Be safe, not sorry!<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - To ignore another's chat<BR>
double-click their name in the people<BR>
list and check "Ignore Member."<BR>
<BR>
*Reminder - Private rooms are just that,<BR>
private. You enter at your own risk.<BR>
<BR>
AOL has hundreds of chat rooms. If the<BR>
conversation in one room makes you<BR>
uncomfortable, try to find another room<BR>
that feels just right for you. :)<BR>
