As a Community Leader, one of your primary functions is to help members and AOL maintain appropriate community standards within our online community. During Community Leader Orientation, all Community Leaders are reacquainted with AOL's Terms of Service and the online tools available to all members for reporting offensive content or conduct. If you'd like to review that module again, go to Keyword: CLHQ > Education > Orientation Training > 3. TOS: AOL's Member Terms of Service.<BR>
<BR>
The Community Guidelines document is the part of the Terms of Service that most directly relates to your volunteer duties. To help you put these guidelines into perspective, we present them as principles:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Illegal Behavior</B><BR>
AOL has zero tolerance for illegal behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Unsolicited E-mail & Advertising</B><BR>
AOL strictly prohibits unsolicited bulk e-mail, doesn't allow chain letters, pyramid schemes, etc., or unsolicited advertising.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Copyrights & Trademarks</B> <BR>
AOL takes copyright and trademark protection seriously.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Internet Content & Behavior</B><BR>
AOL requires that members abide by AOL's Terms of Service no matter where they are on the Internet and abide by the standards for use of other Internet products or areas.<BR>
<BR>
<B>International Areas</B><BR>
AOL International areas are governed by local standards.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Protecting Children</B><BR>
AOL takes extra steps to protect children online.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tools & Resources</B><BR>
AOL provides a number of resources and tools to help members control their online environment.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Community Standards</B><BR>
AOL recognizes that some standards can vary from community to community, but expects all areas to abide by its general Community Guidelines for content and conduct.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to content and conduct falling under the other principles, the following are unacceptable: strong vulgar language, crude sexual references, hate speech, death threats, images of partial or full frontal nudity, images or discussions of gratuitous violence, images or discussions that are harmful or abusive, impersonation, harassment, disruptive behavior, soliciting or posting private information.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>The laws that apply in the offline world must be obeyed online as well.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of the area, AOL may be used only for lawful purposes.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>__________<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
Behavior that may be illegal includes, but is not limited to:<BR>
<BR>
<I>Promoting illegal substances</I>. Buying, selling, or trading an illegal drug, encouraging others to use an illegal drug, or describing how to make or use an illegal drug in words or images.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Promoting illegal use of the phone system (phreaking)</I>. Describing how to use the system to make long-distance calls for free in words or images, trying to buy, sell, or trade this information, or encouraging others in this activity.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Promoting illegal use of computer networks or software (hacking)</I>. Describing how to gain unauthorized access to AOL's files or other software files, trying to buy, sell, or trade this information, or encouraging others in this activity.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Promoting child pornography</I>. Buying, selling, trading, or distributing pornographic materials or encouraging others in this activity.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Promoting other aberrant or illegal behavior</I>. Buying, selling, trading, or distributing images depicting bestiality, necrophilia, or other aberrant or illegal behaviors or otherwise encouraging these behaviors.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Threatening to kill the president</I>. Community Leaders report these instances to the CL Help Desk. The member does not need to indicate they are speaking about the United States President.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Bomb threats</I>. Describing how to build a bomb in words or images, threatening to bomb something, or otherwise encouraging this behavior. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Credit card fraud</I>. Using someone else's credit card, trying to get another person's credit card information, describing how to defraud people, distributing someone else's credit card information. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Use of Terms</B><BR>
We ask you to please be extremely cautious of your use of certain words that have specific legal implications.<BR>
<BR>
Do not use the terms "pedophile" or "pornography" or "illegal" or "solicitation of minors" when describing the content or conduct of particular members on AOL. These terms have specific definitions under the law and it is not for any Community Leader to make a judgment as to the accuracy of such labels. Accusing a member of trading pornography or of being a pedophile could be considered libelous.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Frequently Asked Questions</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>How do we know something is illegal?</I> We don't! There is also no way for you to know with certainty that the member is actually breaking the law and committing an illegal act. If we suspect a behavior may be illegal, we report it and let AOL handle it.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>You may place advertisements only in areas designated for that purpose. Unsolicited advertising is not allowed. This includes the sending of bulk e-mail. You must have permission from AOL and/or the person to whom you are sending the ad.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>__________<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
Unacceptable advertising and related activities include:<BR>
<BR>
<I>Unsolicited bulk e-mail</I>. AOL may not be used to send unsolicited bulk e-mail and Internet users may not send unsolicited bulk e-mail to AOL members. This is strictly prohibited.<BR>
<BR>
Unsolicited bulk e-mail can contain any type of content. Chain letters, pyramid schemes, and advertising are the most common, but disruptive computer code, viruses, password solicitations, and other scams are also sent out in bulk to a mailing list.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Screen name harvesting</I>. Harvesting of names from the member directory, chat room, or message boards is not permitted.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Advertising</I>. AOL may not be used for commercial purposes such as advertising the sale of merchandise, products or services, except in specific areas online (Keyword: CLASSIFIEDS).<BR>
<BR>
AOL's online vendors are, of course, exempt from this policy.<BR>
<BR>
Signature lines may contain links to commercial Web sites as long as the text is not advertising.<BR>
<BR>
If members complain about getting unsolicited advertising in the mail, tell them to forward it to "TOSEmail1" when received from an AOL member or to "TOSSpam" when received from the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Frequently Asked Questions</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>Are we allowed to advertise our Web pages in a chat room?</I> Depending on your forum's guidelines, it may be acceptable to let folks know you have a Web page, as long as you don't do it so often that it becomes disruptive. What you can't say is, "To get a good deal on new computers, go to my Web page at <web page address>."<BR>
<BR>
<I>If you receive a chain letter from a worthy cause, (example: Make A Wish Foundation), what should you do?</I> It's up to you whether to report something received via e-mail, but the source is irrelevant. Unsolicited advertising is unsolicited advertising. Be aware that scam e-mails are often disguised as a worthy non-profit cause. Use your judgment. You may either delete the e-mail, forward it to TOSEmail1 if it's from an AOL member, or forward it to TOSSpam if it's from the Internet.<BR>

<I>Copyright protected materials (pirating)</I>. Buying, selling, trading, or distributing<BR>
copyright protected materials without authorization is unacceptable.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Reporting copyright infringement</I>. Generally the only way AOL can verify that a copyright and trademark infringement has occurred is if the actual copyright or trademark holder complains. Anyone who believes their work has been copied and is accessible on the AOL service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement may notify AOL by completing a copyright complaint form at: http://www.aol.com/info/notify.html<BR>
<BR>
<B>Frequently Asked Questions</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>What is the fair use rule?</I> For information on fair use, see</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <A HREF="http://www.nolo.com/nn75.html">When Copying Is OK: The Fair Use Rule</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>at the nolo.com Web site.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Is it OK to have name brand logos on our Web pages? (We may put up brand names in Web pages to advise others in the group where add-ons or equipment can be obtained for more enjoyment of the game -- there is no monetary gain and it merely helps the member's enjoyment of same.)</I> Company logos are copyright or trademark protected and may not be used without permission. Many companies on the Web, however, make a graphic available specifically for use in linking back to their site. Check the company's Web site to see if one is available.<BR>
<BR>
Using a brand name is fine in a discussion about that product since the discussion would have no basis if the brand name weren't mentioned.<BR>
<BR>
The forum should decide what is and what is not allowed, and then that policy should be posted so the members are educated about what they may post. Brand names only become a problem when consumers use information as a disguise for their own commercial activities.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>...as an AOL member you are required to follow our TOS no matter where you are on the Internet. If another ISP or Internet organization reports you to us, we will take appropriate action against your account the same as we would if you had committed a violation on the AOL service.<BR>
<BR>
...we will enforce our community guidelines for member-created Web pages.<BR>
<BR>
Use of the Internet is at your own risk, and AOL cannot be responsible for the content and conduct you may encounter. If the content or behavior originates outside the AOL community, we cannot remove it and are limited in the actions we can take.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>__________<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
To better educate members, Community Leaders need to understand the difference between AOL and the Internet and various AOL products. Each product and each Internet area may have its own guidelines.<BR>
<BR>
Files located within an AOL member's FTP space (Keyword: MY FTP SPACE) are subject to AOL's Community Guidelines. This includes the content published on a members.aol.com Web page. Unacceptable content on member pages may be reported at Notify AOL.<BR>
<BR>
AOL Hometown has published guidelines available from their home page. AOL Hometown member pages may be reported for unacceptable content by using the Notify AOL hyperlink always available when browsing member pages. AOL Hometown Community Leaders also browse member pages for unacceptable content.<BR>
<BR>
AOL.com has published guidelines available for their chats and message boards. AOL.com Community Leaders browse the message boards for unacceptable content. Chats at the AOL.com site require use of AOL Instant Messenger. These chats are not hosted by Community Leaders.<BR>
<BR>
AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) does not have published guidelines. Users may, however, warn other users. This action limits Instant Message usage for the member receiving the warn. The more warns a user receives, the more limited is their use of the Instant Message feature. The AIM product also provides blocking in both Instant Messages and chat. The only reporting available with AIM is for Community Leaders and AOL/ACI employees. An AIM user who impersonates an AOL employee or Community Leader may be reported to a screen name (please request this screen name from your online coordinator). These impersonations are generally in the form of Instant Message scams to gain passwords or other personal information. You may only report these from your Community Leader screen name.<BR>
<BR>
AOL cannot be responsible for any Internet content that originates outside the AOL community. It does, however, expect links within the community to go to acceptable content. If a member clicks a link anywhere on AOL and the link takes them outside the AOL community, they should see content that abides by AOL's Community Guidelines. Links include hyperlinks in member content sent to chat rooms and posted on message boards.<BR>
<BR>
If a Web page doesn't reside within the AOL community, the content linked to on that page does not necessarily need to abide by AOL's Community Guidelines. It is the member's responsibility to know they are now outside the AOL community and clicking beyond that first page may take them to objectionable content.<BR>

When visiting AOL International areas, conduct is governed by local standards.<BR>
<BR>
AOL Canada, UK, France, and Australia have their own TOS and guidelines and their own Community Leader programs. If you visit these areas as a regular member, be sure to know and abide by their standards.<BR>
<BR>
AOL U.S. Community Leaders do volunteer in the AOL International channel where they apply a "when in Rome" guideline in determining whether content and conduct is appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
Community Leaders outside the International Channel may not report content that is unacceptable when translated to English from a foreign language.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
In areas on the service designed for children 12 and under, AOL and its partners require prior parental consent (for example, by sending in a permission form by regular mail or by fax) before collecting or using names, addresses, telephone numbers or other information that identifies a child offline.<BR>
<BR>
In areas designed for teens 13 through 15, AOL and its partners may not collect names, addresses, telephone numbers or other personally identifiable information without disclosing how that information will be used and notifying teens that they should obtain permission from their parents before providing any information.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>__________<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
AOL takes extra steps to protect children online. AOL has special policies for areas targeting kids and teens, privacy policies to prevent offline identification of children, and parental controls to allow parents to restrict their children's access to online areas and features. A concise version of these policies can be found in the Community Leader Guidelines at Keyword: CLHQ > CL Central > Volunteer Guidelines > Kids and Teens Guidelines. The complete version of these policies can be found at Keyword: CLHQ > Education > Library & Reference > General Reference > AOL's Kids Policies / AOL's Teens Policies.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Personally Identifying Information (PII)</B><BR>
Asking children for personally identifying information is absolutely unacceptable, except as noted in the guidelines for areas designed for kids and teens. We also don't allow this information in content. (Also see "Passwords & Private Information.")<BR>
<BR>
PII includes:<BR>
<BR>
	* full name<BR>
	* any part of a home address<BR>
	* school name<BR>
	* parents' name(s)<BR>
	* birthdate (with year)<BR>
	* home telephone number<BR>
	* social security number<BR>
<BR>
<B>Child Lures</B><BR>
Child lures are specifically aimed at attracting children and attempt to get personal information from children or get children into private rooms or private discussions. For example:<BR>
<BR>
 * Hi! Are there any little boys out there that want to learn <BR>
 * all the tricks of a major league ballplayer?  <BR>
 * I am a very famous major leaguer! I'll tell you who I am <BR>
 * when you come to the PR: World Series Stars.<BR>
<BR>
Never use the terminology "solicitation of minors" and don't appear to accuse members of predatory behavior since it is impossible for us to prove as Community Leaders.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Frequently Asked Questions</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>What is a minor?</I> Anyone under the age of 18 is considered a minor, however, age does not need to be specified to consider a situation questionable. A suspicious request may appear as: "Looking for girls/boys . . . etc."<BR>
<BR>
<I>Is it okay if someone claiming to be a moviemaker asks blondes interested in being in the movies to come to a private room if he doesn't mention an age?</I> If this occurs in a Kid's room, it is not okay. If this occurs in a regular room for all ages, context can apply. If the content is worded in a way that doesn't appear to put children at risk, it may be violating the commercial activity rules.<BR>

AOL does not pre-screen content or monitor all content and conduct at all times. Members must be aware of their environment and take responsibility by using the resources and tools that are available.<BR>
<BR>
Community Leaders are invaluable in helping members to find resources, use tools, and learn about online etiquette.<BR>

Community Leaders educate members about using the "Ignore" feature in chat rooms, the filter feature on message boards, the privacy preferences available with the Buddy List, and the e-mail controls.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>You will be considered in violation of the Terms of Service if you (or others using your account) do any of the following:<BR>
<BR>
Attempt to get a password, other account information, or other private information from a member. Because a member's account is that person's online existence and persona, it is sacrosanct. Remember: AOL employees will NEVER ask for your password. Don't give your password or billing information out to anyone.<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>__________<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<I>Soliciting passwords and private information</I>. AOL may not be used to solicit passwords, account information, or other private information. This includes distributing programs called "sniffers" which are designed to automatically locate and send a member's password to an e-mail address. Password sniffers are misrepresented as ordinary programs in e-mail intended to scam the victim into downloading and running the program. (Also see "Impersonation.")<BR>
<BR>
Password surfing (or "phishing") is the attempt to obtain another member's password so the violator can use that member's account to sign onto AOL. Usually, password surfing occurs in IMs, but you may also witness it in the chat room.<BR>
<BR>
If a member reports receiving a password surf via IM, make sure the member knows to not close the IM window and to report the violation by clicking on the "Notify AOL" button on their IM window. If you receive a password request via IM, you should report it in the same manner. The member who receives the request via IM must report it personally; secondhand reporting does not work.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Posting private information</I>. Phone numbers, credit card numbers, or other personally identifying information is unacceptable in chat rooms and on message boards. We have no way of confirming the information really belongs to the member. (Also see "Protecting Children.")<BR>

Pretend to be anyone whom you are not. You may not impersonate another member (including celebrities), an AOL employee, or a Community Leader. <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>__________<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
A member impersonating another member may use a misleading screen name and/or make false statements. Impersonation is often associated with password surfing (also see "Passwords & Private Information"). Impersonation that threatens members and/or requests personal information (financial, residential) should be reported immediately.<BR>
<BR>
Impersonation does not mean the member who greets other members entering the room or the member who tells other members that their behavior is a violation of the Terms of Service. Members are allowed to issue what appears to be an "official" on-screen warn. As long as the member is not misrepresenting him- or herself as a Community Leader or AOL employee or otherwise "official" representative of that forum or threatening (harassing) other members, the member is not violating the Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.<BR>
<BR>
When reporting an impersonation violation, you may need to explain who is being impersonated.<BR>

<I>Language:</I> Mild expletives and non-sexual anatomical references are allowed, but strong vulgar language, crude or explicit sexual references, hate speech, etc. are not.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Sex/Sensuality:</I> There is a difference between affection and vulgarity. There is also a difference between a discussion of the health or emotional aspects of sex using appropriate language, and more crude conversations about sex. The former is acceptable, the latter is not. For example, in a discussion about forms of cancer, the words "breast" or "testicular" would be acceptable, but slang versions of those words would not be acceptable anywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Violence and drug abuse:</I> Graphic images of humans being killed, such as in news accounts, may be acceptable in some areas, but blood and gore, gratuitous violence, etc., are not acceptable.  Discussions about coping with drug abuse in health areas are okay, but discussions about or depictions of illegal drug abuse that imply it is acceptable are not.<BR>
<BR>
Please bear in mind that these are only guidelines; there is always a "gray area." Use your best judgment. Ask yourself if this is something that you would say in a room full of people you never met, or in the workplace. However, AOL makes the final determination about whether content is objectionable or not.<BR>
<BR>
Hate speech is never allowed.<BR>

Language must be viewed in context. Unacceptable language directed at another member is always viewed with less tolerance (see "Harassment"). The following guidelines apply:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Violence</B><BR>
Language that is clearly intended to be harmful, abusive, or violent is absolutely unacceptable. Death threats, descriptions of humans or animals being maimed or killed, and discussions of gratuitous violence are absolutely unacceptable. Be aware that there is a difference between discussing or describing an act of violence with a news or educational purpose and discussing or describing violence to be offensive, harmful, or abusive. Violent language can be harassment, however, violent language is not necessarily directed at a particular member or group of members involved in a current discussion.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hate Speech</B><BR>
Hate speech is absolutely unacceptable in any area. Hate speech is content that is intended to victimize, harass, degrade or intimidate an individual or group on the basis of their religion, gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, or other unalterable characteristics. Hate speech can be harassment, however, hate speech is not necessarily directed at a particular member or group of members involved in a current discussion.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Vulgarity</B><BR>
Prime-time television standards (not cable) may be used as a guideline when determining if a word or the context is vulgar. "Common street language" or mild expletives are acceptable, particularly when used in a positive manner (i.e., to endorse a favorite sports team). If the member uses a word to refer to a body part or bodily function in an inappropriate manner, it is probably vulgar.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sexually Explicit</B><BR>
Sexually explicit references are descriptions of body parts, bodily functions, or actions with clear sexual context. <BR>
<BR>
Members often use innuendo, where words may have a non-sexual meaning that can be easily interpreted in such a manner. We do not consider innuendo to be in itself unacceptable.<BR>
<BR>
	* In general, cunnilingus, fellatio, and masturbation as topics of discussion in general member areas are unacceptable (unless it's hosted by a Community Leader). Use your judgment here.<BR>
	* Discussion of cross-dressing, transvestites, transsexuals, and bisexuality are generally considered acceptable in the proper forums or rooms, including many of the gay & lesbian (G & L) rooms. In religious forums, it may be (and probably is) disruptive.<BR>
	* Use of any of the terms that might be considered otherwise offensive must be considered within the context they are used. This is particularly important in certain People Connection event rooms, specific forum chat rooms and boards, or "debate" rooms and boards, where the topic of discussion and the context makes it appropriate for the use of the true names of body parts and sexual activities.<BR>
	* Use of the following words in a non-sexual context is acceptable: defecation, genitalia, penis, semen, urination, vagina, and douche. Discretion should be used in these areas: Thrive, Health, and Online Psych, as well as many of the gay and lesbian areas. These rooms and boards are good examples of online areas where you might find frank sexual discussions which are not considered to be violations of TOS.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Masking and Phonetic Spelling</B><BR>
If a word or phrase would be unacceptable, masking or phonetic spelling does not make it less unacceptable. Masking consists of replacing letters with symbols (i.e., f**k). Phonetic spelling consists of replacing letters with a phonetic equivalent (i.e., phuk). If the word can be recognized by itself or within the context of a phrase and the meaning is clear to everyone present, it is still unacceptable. For a word to be considered masked, the word must meet the following requirements:<BR>
<BR>
	* The word must be easily discernible as being unacceptable.<BR>
	* The masked word must have at least one (1) real letter of the unacceptable word.<BR>
<BR>
Masking is often an attempt to tone down vulgarity. If a masked word could easily be interpreted as non-vulgar, then the language can be considered acceptable.<BR>
<BR>
<B>In Kids and Teens Areas</B><BR>
References to or discussion of sex are never appropriate in a room specifically for kids and should be kept appropriate for the particular age group in rooms for young teens and teens.<BR>
<BR>
Mild expletives and "common street language" may be unacceptable in kids and young teens areas where higher standards apply. Words like crap, dung, turd, damn, hell, butt and ass man are considered a violation in Kids Only. Inappropriate descriptions of certain body parts (boob) are considered vulgarity in Kids Only and descriptions of bodily functions (such as pooping) are not permitted. Using the word <I>sucks</I> (i.e., "I suck" or "This sucks") is not a violation.<BR>
<BR>
