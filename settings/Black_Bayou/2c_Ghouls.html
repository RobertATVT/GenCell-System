<BR>
So you want a taste of the Vampire life, but you don't want to be damned?  Well, it doesn't always come so easy.  Ghouls are mortals.  They have been fed the blood of a Vampire without having been drained of their own.  The Vampire now has a willing subject to feed from without killing them.  <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><I>The Becoming:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B></I>When a mortal consumes at least a quart of undiluted Vampire blood, it surges through his veins, pushing his body beyond the normal maximums.  Almost like a PCP trip, but much more intense, the mortal's strength and speed are heightened.  In addition, the mortal gains a few vampiric abilities.  Unfortunately, the mortal becomes a Ghoul, a loyal slave to the Vampire blood donor.  The Ghoul becomes addicted to the blood after the first feeding.  By the time the effects begin to wear off, the Ghoul is back with the Vampire begging for more.  More than one Vampire has had to slay a former Ghoul they no longer cared for when they constantly tried to gain more blood.  It is not uncommon for those who were once enslaved to become hunters, seeking out the potent Vampire blood.  When the Vampire feeds the mortal its blood, the vampire player rolls 2d6+Soul vs the victim's 2d6+Body.  The roll needs to be made regardless of whether the mortal is willing or not, since its the body that must accept the blood, not the mind. If the roll is unsuccessful, the vampire must roll 2d6+Body+Athletics vs. the Ghoul's roll of 2d6+Body+Athletics.  If the Vampire wins this roll, he is able to break away from the drinking ghoul.  If the mortal is not restrained, they will end up drinking the vampire dry causing the vampire's Mind statistic to drop to 0</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>A Vampire can only make 1 such attempt on any single mortal per night.  The Ghouling will last for 1 week.  Once the week is up, the mortal loses the bonus of the Ghouling immediately.  This causes severe depression and a constant sense of exhaustion in the mortal.  All rolls for the following week after a Ghouling ends and is not renewed are at -4.<BR>
<BR>
The Vampire will lose -3 from their Mind stat for the rest of the night after a Ghouling, successful or not.  They will regain these points as they heal overnight.  This only happens the first time they feed the victim, additional feedings do not require as much blood.  If the Vampire tries to make another new Ghoul in the same night, the Vampire will suffer the effects again.  Feedings are allowed once a week, but the Ghoul is allowed to resist at each feeding.  Each successive ghouling gives the Vampire a better "hold" on you, therefore providing the Vampire with a +1 to their roll.  This modifier is cumulative.  At the end of one week the Vampire must re-feed the Ghoul and roll again. This Ghouling process must be posted.<BR>
<BR>
A vampire can have no more than 3 Ghouls at any given time.<BR>

So they will recover from a knife wound in a few days, but a shotgun would take 12 days, or almost two weeks.  A member of this breed receiving professional care will recover at 2x the normal rate.  So that's about 1 point every day and a half.  A knife wound would require a day and a half, while a shotgun would require 6 days.  While injured, the character may role-play as normal, but must role-play their injuries (i.e., a person shot in the side would have it bandaged up and be very sore).  Also, remember the healing process isn't necessarily complete at the point they recover.  It simply means their bodies have returned to a normal using condition.  They may still have scars, or stiffness, or short, sharp pains.  How the injuries are role-played is up to the player.<BR>

Effect/Description:  In intense situations, the human body is known to perform above and beyond normal levels.  Stories abound of mothers lifting cars to save their children, or people reacting fast enough to cut in front of a speeding car to save a life.  Seemingly impossible feats brought on by a simple little hormone called adrenaline.  Any one physical roll is made at +8 (must be stated to the ST which roll before use, may not be used to add to mental roll, such as a will roll).  This mastery may only be used once per night.<BR>

Effect/Description:  What is it about mortals that seems to always get them out of trouble at just the right moment?  Whatever it is, this is the tendency for things to fall in place at just the right time.  The user may re-roll any 1 dice roll.  It may not be used to re-roll the same dice roll more than once, and the user must take whatever the second roll is, regardless of the result.

System/Duration:  NA / NA<BR>
Effect/Description:  Everyone has that little something they just seem naturally gifted at.  Whether it be juggling, mathematics, or knife throwing, it's there, and it's just waiting to be found.  The player may gain 1 skill at level 3 for no cost, except Lore.  However, they may not use other points to build upon the skill at generation, only later with updates.  This skill must have an * by its name to denote which skill is the Gift.  Should you purchase an Occupational Training type that grants a non-combat skill bonus that you have chosen for your Gift, the bonus levels add to the ones granted by the Gift.  You may only use a skill from the non-combat skill list as your Gift if an occupation gives you additional levels in it during character generation.  If you ever change breeds, you do not lose the levels of the gift unless they interfere with another rule.  For example, if you have Chi it is automatically replaced with the fighting style of the new breed at half its current level.  The levels are still halved as normal, even if it was the Gift.<BR>
