<BR>
Welcome to the Volunteer Guidelines.  This document was created by the CLO, your internal Community Managers, and AOL's Human Resources department to provide guidance, consistency and support for you during your tenure as a volunteer.  We want to point out that this is a living document and is subject to change.  Notices of change will always be posted in Keyword: CLHQ. <BR>
<BR>
Please take a few moments to read through these guidelines.  They are a reference point for you throughout your time as a Community Leader.  As a team of people volunteering together, all Community Leaders should adhere to these standards.<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind, the area in which you volunteer may have guidelines that are more specific.  They may expound upon the guidelines in this document.  So, please be sure to check with your supervisors or stop into your private staff area for more information on area specific guidelines.  The guidelines provided by the CLO are general guidelines intended to make your stay as an online volunteer enjoyable and productive<BR>
<BR>
Thank you,<BR>

<BR>
If a member threatening legal action addresses you, forward the mail/IM log to your online coordinator.  Do not correspond with this member.  The AOL Legal Department or Partner will review the situation.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=14><B><U>Military Guidelines:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>

If you are a Community Leader in the Military and are called away to Military service, contact (if possible) your Forum Leader to inform them of the situation.  In such an event, after 2 months, you have not been able to resume as a volunteer; your account will transfer back to billable status.  Upon return, if you wish to volunteer with the program, please contact your online coordinator.

<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=14><B><U>Newsletter Tips</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
It has come to our attention that some volunteers who distribute <I>solicited</I> newsletters are being reported to TOS because a member has mistaken the publication for SPAM.  <BR>
<BR>
To prevent this from occurring from this point forward, we have put together a "tips list" for you to reference when creating your newsletters.  These tips have all been included in this list because they address some of the top reasons why newsletters are mistaken for SPAM.  If you are responsible for distributing a solicited newsletter to the members in your forum, feel free to review these tips and incorporate them into your future publications.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER></FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><U><BR>
Top Eleven Tips</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
The following tips are recommended for any Community Leader who is sending solicited e-mail to AOL members.  These tips are designed to encourage high subscription and member satisfaction levels, and to help ensure that your e-mail is not mistaken for Spam by the member.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tip #1:</B> <B>Mass mailings should be free of charge to the member, observe TOS and AOL's Privacy Policy.  All mailings to AOL members must be solicited.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Tip #2: Differentiate your mailing from spam through consistency, frequency, and personality.</B><BR>
Send your mailing on the same day. Send your mailing at least once every two weeks. Use an e-mail address that reflects the content/personality of your area and use it consistently. Alert members before you change delivery times, frequency, or sending screen name.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Consistency and alerts help protect you against impersonation. Personality and frequency make the mailing more relevant to the member. </I><BR>
<BR>
<B>Tip #3: Keep it short.</B><BR>
Keep your mailing to one printed page or less. Length is the number one reason why a member deletes or unsubscribes from a newsletter.<BR>
<B><BR>
Tip #4: Do not include attached files or embedded images in your mailings.<BR>
<BR>
Tip #5: Include obvious, easy to use unsubscribe directions in your mailing.  </B>A one click unsubscribe process is ideal.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Example:</B> That's it for this week! I'll be back next week with more tips, links, and special deals! To unsubscribe from this newsletter go to Keyword: <A HREF="aol://4344:1207.newslet.9442122.568849767">C&S News</A> and click "Unsubscribe."<B><BR>
<BR>
Tip #6: Your mailing should be solicited, but it is important to regularly remind members that the mailing that they are receiving is free and that they did subscribe to it.</B><BR>
Many members forget that they've subscribed to a mailing.  Regularly reinforce the concept that the member subscribed to the mailing and that it is private -- the member's e-mail address will not be sold or distributed to an outside party.  <B><BR>
</B><BR>
<B>Example: </B>PS: You are receiving AOL's International Channel Newsletter, "<B><I>Around the World with AOL"</B></I> because you subscribed to it. Your subscription to our newsletter is free and confidential (we don't like junk e-mail either)!  You may unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time.  Simply click <A HREF="aol://4344:595.intl.4401639.527632363">here</A> and then click the <B>Unsubscribe</B> button.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<B>Tip #7: Use your mailing as an incentive for members to visit your area (not as an alternate content delivery vehicle). </B><BR>
If a member receives all of the content of your area in their mailbox, there is no reason for him/her to visit your area. Limiting your mailing to one printed page and using hyperlinks in context will help you achieve this goal. In order to ensure that members remain focused on your core message, try not to include more than 5 hyperlinks per e-mail. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tip #8: Provide instructions on using hyperlinks and keywords -- not all members know how to use them.  Also, be sure to hyperlink to areas on AOL (not the web).</B><BR>
<B>Example: Newsletter</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#004080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> tip:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </B>Click on the <A HREF="aol://4344:1580.FFhyper.12255782.524456031">blue underlined</A> words to go directly to our featured travel areas.<BR>
<B><BR>
Tip #9: Remember that members don't read mail as soon as it is sent.</B><BR>
Be sure that your hyperlinks last for at least one week.  If your mailing contains a time sensitive offer, clearly communicate the expiration date.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tip #10: Make your subscription form simple and easy to use. </B><BR>
Describe your newsletter to members and make it clear that it's free and delivered by<BR>
e-mail.  Provide members with a one-click subscription process. <BR>
<BR>
Example: <A HREF="aol://1722:C&Snews">The Weekly Byte</A> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Tip #11: Communicate with the member as soon as s/he subscribes or unsubscribes from your mailing. </B><BR>
Send a short confirmation/welcome message to newly subscribed members; send a "good-bye" message to members who've asked to be removed from your distribution list, encourage them to visit your area.<BR>
<BR>

Participation in AOL Contests and Promotions:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
AOL does not wish to intrude on the Community Leader’s member experience.  Community Leaders are permitted to participate in contests and giveaways so long as the promotion is not running in the forum in which they volunteer.   <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=14><B><U>Press Communication:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
Should a member of the press contact you, refer them to AOL Corporate Communications at (703) 265-1746.<BR>
<BR>
Should you have a question pertaining to press related inquiries, please contact Kristin Buchanan at <A HREF="mailto:BuchananK">BuchananK.</A><BR>
<BR>
As a reminder, discussions with the press are in direct violation of your NDA.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><U>Problem Resolution</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
AOL makes every attempt to maintain a positive, productive, and fair environment.  Part of this commitment is encouraging an open and honest atmosphere in which problems, complaints, suggestions, or questions receive a timely response from ACI supervisors and management. Community Leaders are encouraged to offer positive and constructive criticism.<BR>
<BR>
In any organization, misunderstandings or conflicts can arise.  It is important to address concerns BEFORE serious problems develop.  If you find yourself in a situation that you feel needs extra attention, the following problem resolution procedure has been developed for your use as a Community Leader:<BR>
<BR>
(Community Leaders will not be penalized, formally or informally, for voicing a complaint in regards to policy, or practice with AOL in a reasonable, and courteous manner, or for using the problem resolution procedure.)  *The Community Leader may discontinue the procedure at any step.<BR>
<BR>
1. If possible, first discuss the issue with the other person(s) involved.   There are two sides to almost every situation; take the time to consider both.<BR>
<BR>
2. Should the issue require further attention, AOL/ACI encourages Community Leaders to seek assistance from their immediate supervisor<BR>
<BR>
3. If the issue is still not resolved, talk with the leader of the Forum for final resolution.<BR>
<BR>
** As always, the Community Leaders Organization and their Managers maintain an open door policy. Coming soon is a process to assist Community Leaders with resolution issues that are in need of special attention.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B><U>Professional Behavior:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
The Community Leader golden rule: Treat others, as you would want them to treat you.  Deal directly and honestly with your fellow volunteers while demonstrating the thought process that everyone's opinion matters. <BR>
<BR>
You have the opportunity daily, to cooperate and work with others to enhance the member experience.<BR>
<BR>
A few starting points:<BR>
1. Your Community Leader screen name is to be used <U>only</U> while you are wearing your volunteer "hat", (i.e., only when acting as a volunteer).  All screen names on your Community Leader account are expected to comply with the guidelines set forth in this document.<BR>
<BR>
2. Interactions with AOL members must be handled in a professional manner.  Harassing, or arguing with any AOL member, employee, or Community Leader is not permitted, and will be considered grounds for immediate release as a Community Leader.  (See above golden rule)<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=14><B><U>Profiles:<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
As an AOL Community Leader volunteer, we hold any information you choose to share with other members in your Member profile, to a high standard.  As such, any material in your profile associated with your Community Leader name, or any screen name on that account, should adhere to AOL's Terms of Service under <A HREF="aol://4344:1732.tos13.13706262.563226379"> Proper Online Conduct</A>.  These profiles should be free from slang or content that could be considered objectionable or offensive to the general public.  Examples of insinuating content in a Member profile that would violate TOS:<BR>
<BR>
-Pretending to be anyone whom you are not.  You may not impersonate another member (including celebrities), an AOL employee, or a Community Leader.<BR>
-Explicit/vulgar/obscene or violent words and abbreviations. <BR>
-Racially or ethnically offensive words and abbreviations.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=14><B><U>Screen Name Guidelines:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
<I>It is very important that you read, understand, and comply with the AOL/Community Leader policies regarding the proper use of your Community Leader account.  Misuse of your Community Leader account is a very serious matter that could result in removal from the volunteer program.<BR>
<B></I><U><BR>
</B></U>As a Community Leader, you are given one (1) Community Leader account, regardless of the number of volunteer positions you may have.  You are responsible for all activities on this account.  Your screen names/positions must not exceed four (4) spaces on one account, excluding the master screen name.<BR>
<BR>
When volunteering you must use your forum-designated prefix.    <BR>
<BR>
All screen names on your Community Leader account should adhere to AOL's Terms of Service under <A HREF="aol://4344:1732.tos13.13706262.563226379"> Proper Online Conduct</A>.  "Play" screen names should be free from slang or content that could be considered objectionable or offensive to the general public.  Examples of insinuating content in a screen name that would violate TOS:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-Pretending to be anyone whom you are not.  You may not impersonate another member (including celebrities), an AOL employee, or a Community Leader.  <BR>
-Explicit/vulgar/obscene or violent words and abbreviations. <BR>
-Racially or ethnically offensive words and abbreviations.<BR>
<BR>
Please refrain from giving your family or your friends access to your Community Leader account. Community Leader accounts have access to areas of AOL that contain confidential (proprietary) information.  Therefore, it is your responsibility, as a volunteer, to safeguard the integrity of your account. <B><BR>
<BR>
</B>All personal business and communications should be conducted under your personal screen name. <B><BR>
<BR>
</B>When you join the Community Leader program your account is converted to a specific account type and is considered AOL property.  Your Community Leader account is company property for the length of your volunteer service.  <BR>
<BR>
Upon departure from the Community Leader program, your Community Leader account will be converted back to a normal paying member account under your control.  <BR>
At that time, you must remove all screen names with a designated prefix (e.g., AFL, Guide, LDRS, etc.), or those that were used for primary Community Leader duties but are without a designated prefix (A.k.a. Preferred Name), within 24 hours.<BR>
If you use your Preferred name <I><U>only</I></U> to receive forum announcements, newsletters and the like, but it is not your primary volunteer name, then this screen will not need to be deleted.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=14><B><U>Third Party Tools:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
The CLO does not promote any particular add-on tool at this time.  Selection and use of add-on tools are to be used at your own discretion.<BR>
<BR>
The CLO is not responsible for any third party license agreement that you acquire while performing your volunteer duties.<BR>
<BR>
As stated in <A HREF="aol://4344:1732.tos04.13706086.560706947">TOS >AOL Software licenses</A>; timer-defeating software is not permitted.<BR>
"AOL provides you with a limited license to use our software, which you agree to use in accordance with these rules... We reserve the right to log off accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time and we prohibit the use of tools that defeat AOL's automatic log-off feature."<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=14><B><U>Time Away:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
While Community Leaders are volunteers, keeping your commitment to your shift mates, peers, teams and AOL members is important.<BR>
<BR>
CLO/ACI understands there are emergencies and other situations that may call you away from your volunteer commitments.  As a result, we have created the following Guidelines for "Time Away".  Time away is defined as any reason that precludes you from volunteering the scheduled hours to which you have committed.<BR>
<BR>
If you are planning to take time away, please contact your online coordinator at least two weeks in advance, if possible, so you can arrange to have your volunteer commitments covered.  At the end of the agreed upon time away, we assume that you will return to your volunteer commitments. <BR>
<BR>
We understand that medical emergencies and other situations may arise and you might need extensive time away from your volunteer duties.  Please contact your online coordinator to let them know.  If after 2 months, you have not been able to resume as a volunteer, you will need to delete your Community Leader name, and your account will be converted to billable status.  If you wish to return to the volunteer program, please contact your online coordinator.  Your account will be reviewed to determine if there is still a need for the particular position, as well as any necessary retraining requirements.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=14><B><U>TOS Violations Incurred While a Community Leader:</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></U><BR>
<BR>
It is expected that as a Community Leader, you maintain an account in accordance with the Terms of Service.  <BR>
<BR>
As a Community Leader, you are responsible for all activities on your account. If you receive a TOS violation, we will release you from the program. <BR>
<BR>
If your Community Leader account has been compromised, immediately notify your online coordinator.  For reactivation, call the Community Leader/Partner Help Desk at 1-888-265-0779. <BR>
<BR>
** A "Two Strike" policy is in effect for compromised accounts.  If your account has been compromised two or more times, the account will be reviewed for possible cancellation, and we may ask you to discontinue your participation in the Community Leader program. <BR>

<BR>
You, as a Community Leader, play a unique role in the AOL community.  Though you are also still an AOL member, as a Community Leader you are held to an even higher standard of online conduct.  You are subject to the same terms and conditions while using the service that we require for all of our members including TOS.  As such, we ask that you maintain high standards when communicating to members online, especially while representing AOL and the Community Leader program in your volunteer capacity.

</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Harassment is not acceptable behavior for any AOL volunteer. America Online considers harassment a very serious issue. Respecting the people you volunteer with,  their individuality and opinions is vital to making this arrangement successful. <BR>
<BR>
Formally defined, harassment is any action - including derogatory comments, inappropriate gestures, offensive visual material or hostile behavior - that another individual finds offensive. Discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, disability or any other personal characteristic will not be tolerated within the AOL volunteer Community.<BR>
<BR>
If you feel you have been harassed, you should tell the person how you feel - if you feel comfortable doing so. If not, contact your online coordinator (or the next highest  manager with whom you feel comfortable discussing the incident) immediately. Your claim will be investigated thoroughly, and no repercussive actions will be made toward you.<BR>
<BR>
Individuals who engage in any form of harassment face serious consequences, up to and including release from the volunteer program.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>

<BR>
Be aware that when you create a Web site using your Community Leader account, this makes you more vulnerable to harassment and hackers’ manipulation of your material.  If you create a web page under your Community Leader screen name and you leave the AOL volunteer program, the web page under that name will be deleted.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, the 18 Megs of additional FTP space requested by many Community Leaders will be deleted upon your departure.<BR>
