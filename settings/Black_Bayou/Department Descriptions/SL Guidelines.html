 <BR>
 </I>Before we get into the details of what a storyline is and what rules must be followed in order to have one approved, we must understand the context in which this will be applied.  In order to understand that we must know that, Black Bayou is a creative work in progress.  Every day the game grows larger and larger as each of the players add new history and background to this setting.  Most of this is done through role-playing and posting, however, there is also a large portion that is done in behind the scenes and like a director in a movie you must decide what takes place and how it will happen. This is done through storylines.  Storylines are used to create more permanent standing details to the world that is Black Bayou.  This takes shape in businesses, breed changes, and general plot synopsis that will be played by willing (and on rare occasion, unwilling) participants.  Below are the general usage for storylines, and what ones are and are not valid.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>Valid Storylines:<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B>	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#1 Age -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Some characters may wish to begin above or below the approvable ages for a starting character in the game. Normally, a maximum age is set at seventy-five years (excluding Mortals) and a minimum age of 21. For a character of any Breed that wishes to be over or under these ages, a Storyline needs to be written up detailing out the reason for the old/young age. <BR>
<BR>
 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#2 Backgrounds -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Some players will need extensive SLs for their characters backgrounds. SL BGs can range anywhere from Government backgrounds, to Occupational backgrounds.  Sometimes a player has such an extensive BG that an SL is needed to cover any loopholes that may need to be resolved before character approval.<BR>
<BR>
 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#3 Breed Changes -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Some breeds require an approved storyline in order for the Breed Coordinator to see that you indeed have the reasoning, and methods to become that breed.  There are only a few reasons why an SL is needed to become a Breed. One would be to have your character become an Angel or a Demon.  Another ~ leaving an existing Breed to become Mortal.  Or maybe you wish to jump into the ranks of learning the arts of the Lamia or Psychics? In the event of questions to what breeds can do, here is a quick reference to the chart in the rulebook that shows what a character can change to.<BR>
 <BR>

 All of the yellow highlighted sections above need a Storyline to be approved. The red highlighted sections must have a Storyline if an NPC is the mentor teaching you the tricks of the trade. These submissions will be looked at by both the Breed Coordinator and the Storyline Departments.<BR>
 <BR>
 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#4 Businesses -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Lots of players wish to create something in the game that may live on after they are gone, something that can be taken up should their character meet and unfortunate end.  One of these ways is through the creation of a business.  Businesses don't provide the character with any statistical bonuses or penalties, they simply provide background and role-playing potential.  They answer certain questions about who the character is.  What does your character does during the day before the main room opens?  How does your character manage to afford the insurance on that new sports car he just acquired?  Well, if you own a business or participate in the storyline with the business owner, there is some method to justify certain things in your characters life.<BR>
<BR>
 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#5 Crime -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> People want to commit crimes, but they want a good plotline behind what they are doing.  Whether it be for computer hacking or smuggling of illegal weapons into town players should have an SL to cover all proverbial bases.<BR>
<BR>
 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#6 Death -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I><BR>
 		<B>PC Death - </B>This is when a player/players plot out and go after another player or group of players.  Normally most PC Death SLs are specific and name the victims, others don't if they are linked to random murders.  All Logs and posts for Death SLs must be sent directly to the SL Department so everything can be tracked to avoid any OOC Manipulation.  Death SLs should be precise and as exact as possible.  Death SLs usually have an ST assigned to them so a single ST can know the background of the plotline prior to any RPd scenes. <BR>
 		<B>SL Vs SL - </B>Want to invade an estate that has an SL?  Or maybe you want to make an attempt to garner information about a person or place.  If a player has an SL running and another player wants to bunk that SL, then an SL will be needed.  Like PC Death SLs, logs and posts must be done and sent into the SL Department.  These type of Death SLs are STd by a GM because nine times out of ten they involve a place in Voletta rather than a person.<BR>
<BR>
 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#7 Escape - </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>Some characters find themselves held against their wills and have to resort to making up SLs so they can flee from an unwanted captivity.  All information should be gathered from the captive player as well as the abductor so TNs can be set for the attempted escape.  <BR>
<BR>
 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#8 Family -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Five PC members per family.  This doesn't include packs or vampire families but actual blood relations.  Genealogical trees should be done for each member and updated when/if a new member of the family arrives. <BR>
<I><BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>	#9 Government - </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I>All government SLs must be AFD or FD approved, For one major reason.  The Government is the largest and most powerful organization in the game, and as such must be carefully monitored and controlled.  <BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>	#10 Occupations -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Some occupations require Storyline approval, these Occupations are: CEO, Federal Agents, and any Occupation not listed within the rules.<BR>
 <BR>
 * Note: In order for an SL to remain active the players involved must also keep their character sheets active during the storylines duration.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> <BR>
 ** Note: The Storyline Department will normally send out reminders on submitted Storylines 10 days after the last Pending letter on the submission. Players are allowed two follow up letters to go without response before they are given a denial letter for lack of interest in the storyline. The second time that this occurs with one of a players storylines, the player will be asked to give the SL Department as many responses as Pending letters sent out. If the player does not respond to any of these letters in the total span of 30 days then the third time you submit an SL you will be asked to wait a probation period of no less then 6 months (one renewal cycle for all renewable storylines) up to one year (the sum of two such cycles). </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=4 PTSIZE=11><B>Invalid Storylines:</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
 	</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>#1 Magic Items -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> All powers and special abilities in Black Bayou may only be played if you have purchased that ability and/or mastery.  Fantasy based storylines for Excalibur, magic rings that shoot fireballs, etc., do not fit in the confines of the Gothic Horror setting that Black Bayou takes place.  The only supernatural powers that a character may use are ones for their Breed, so you can't have a wrist cuff that will let your Werewolf fly, the same way that you will not be allowed to have a mask that will allow your Psychic to go into Mist Form.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>	#2 Facial / Identity Changes -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> As much as it is scientifically and reasonable to have this done, it's not allowed here.  This stems from several reasons, but the main concern is the possibility to use a storyline to justify OOC Manipulation.  <BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>	#3 Advanced Technology -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Besides maintaining some basis in reality, this just isn't a science fiction game and we try to stay more focused on the Gothic Horror setting of Voletta rather than technological leaps and bounds.  <BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>	#4 Repeatable Breed Changes -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Cures for Vampirism, The Werewolf Genetic Virus, and a Method of Excorcism to remove the Angelic or Demonic Host on a continual basis will not be approved.  Breed Change SL's are for a one time only basis.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>	#5 Breed Reversals -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> Due to the limited amount of breed changes allowed in the game, forcing a player out of a Breed without their consent is not allowed.  Mortals can be turned into a breed without consent, however, taking the werewolf that just chewed up your next door neighbor and changing them back into a mortal cannot.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#400040" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B><I>	#6 Circumvention of Rules -</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B></I> No storyline will be approved to allow a player to "get around" the rules.  This is pretty simple, the rules are here to setup certain parameters in which the Player Characters may or may not interact, and no measure of creative writing will allow someone to alter that.<BR>
 <BR>
 Storylines are used as guides for a particular set of role-playing scenes.  These individual scenes add together to make up the story that you wish your character to play through.  This could be anything from a kidnapping and a rescue, to getting a group of players together for a celebration.  The most important thing to consider when creating a storyline is if a storyline is even needed.  A person can send an email to his friends with his idea for a gathering or post invitations on the Message Boards to spread the news about the social event, this can all be handled by the player so is there actually any need for a storyline?  Considering that more times that naught unwanted elements can appear out of nowhere during such events it's a good idea to have a storyline and Host present to help assist with any problems that could arise. <BR>
<BR>
Some smaller plotlines can be done without an approved storyline, however in cases where players not directly involved in your plotline could be effected or your storyline will have some impact on the game then it as at this point where storylines are highly recommended.  Storylines are a method of protecting your character, and the other characters involved, from getting abused in the plotline that you have created.  Below is the criteria for Storylines and the format in which they should be submitted.<BR>
 <BR>
Storyline Durations: Most storylines will need to be resubmitted for reapproval after 6 months from their original approval date.  At the time of these renewals any income maintenance, computer security or updating of the plotline of any kind will need to be done.  The SL Department may also ask for additional posts on the progress of the storyline. <BR>
<BR>
"Grandfathered" SL's are special cases. These are SL's that have been running for a long time, some even since the inception of the game. In some regards they may bend, or even break, the above mentioned rules. Since these SL's were implemented under a different set of rules, different SL managers and even circumstances that may no longer apply, special handeling of them will be taken on a case by case basis. <BR>
<BR>
The Mind Vault Post Links and Above and Beyond Points.  The Storyline Department requests that Approved Storyline post links or logs be placed in the Mind Vault Post Links folder.  Not only does this folder allow the Storyline Department to easier track the approved storylines running in the game but it also helps the department assign appropriate A&B to players who are putting forth an effort to keep Black Bayou interesting.  A character cannot earn more than 20 A&B Points per month from the Storyline Department.  Logs that have been used to write posts for plotlines in SLs should not be posted in the Mind Vault Post Links. <BR>
<BR>
When posting Links or Logs, please use the following format on the MB subject line.<BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><Approved SL Title> <Link/Log> <Current Date> <HOST that approved your SL><BR>
<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Include the link that goes to your SL post.  If you are posting a log - include the date that the log was played out.  It is recognized that logs can run extremely long, so feel free not to post the entire log but use your better judgment as to C&Ping scenes.  Also remember to edit any TOS violations that may be included in Private Room RPd scenes. <BR>
<I><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER> <B></I>~ The Criteria for Storylines ~</B><BR>
 <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT> After you have thought of the storyline that you wish to enter into the game, here are a few questions to ask yourself.<BR>
 <BR>
  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B>1)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> <B>Are there two (2) or more characters involved in the storyline?</B><BR>
      If the answer is yes, and it isn't a storyline for an occupation, background related or a personal security plot, then go on to the next point.  If the answer if no, then let's see why it won't be passed.<BR>
 <BR>
       We are not accepting SLs that center on only one person.  A storyline that deals only with your character performing mundane tasks, or taking a trip overseas, doesn't warrant a storyline.  If that trip overseas was to pick up a new tidbit of lore from an ancient NPC, then you might have a little more to work with.  But will your character need to go overseas to learn that lore?  Involving other players in your storylines has merit for several reasons.  The first being that it opens you up to more role-playing potential.  Perhaps there is another player character that you want to play with in character and simply haven't had a justifiable reason, then you find out in character that this person knows what you are wanting to learn.  Plan a trip to get them alone overseas so that they can teach you free of the tense atmosphere that Voletta provides.  Perhaps that trip overseas is the exchange for the knowledge you will be learning.  Now you have your trip, and a justifiable reason for a storyline.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B> 2) </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Okay, I have two (2) or more characters in my SL, and I want to blow something up, buy items from the black market, create a storm using powerful magic, etc., do I have to submit a storyline?</B><BR>
 	Yes, you do.  Why you ask?  The first reason is that you are attempting to create something that will alter places, people, or things in game.  <BR>
 	Some storylines that affect the setting and characters in Black Bayou need to be known to us and the Forum Director.  If we don't know about it, and don't have that documentation to say it's official, then it simply won't happen.  Basically, we need to let the rest of the staff know that you are planning to blow up a building, make a storm, etc.  Anything that affects Black Bayou as a whole needs to be approved on an official basis.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B> 3)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> <B>Okay. I've got this SL and someone might die because of it, do I need to submit it?</B><BR>
 	Yes, this is to allow staff to keep an eye on what's going to happen and make sure that it is done fairly for both parties.  Even if the victim doesn't know it's going to happen there needs to be a method to prevent the use of Out of Character information to see that it happens.  This is done with an approved storyline and having a storyteller assigned to it.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B> 4) </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Can I use NPC's in my storyline?</B><BR>
 	Sometimes a player simply can't find someone to do what they need or justify getting that information for plotline development of your character. There are instances when NPC's will be allowed in a Storyline, however storylines that simply consist of one player involved and nothing but NPC's isn't a good idea either.  NPC's should be a last ditch effort when nothing else can be done to achieve the story you have in mind, they shouldn't be used as a crutch nor should they be allowed to gain In Character information about other Player Characters.  NPC's aren't able to be played in the MR, simply for the fact that the have the chance to interact and affect others that aren't involved in your plotline.  NPCs aren't allowed to be the focal point of storylines.<BR>
 <BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B> 5) </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>I want to make a new business, what do I need to do?  </B><BR>
 	There are always new businesses and restaurants popping up in *any* city from time to time.  However we have some general rules.  Grandiose hotels/casions/tourists attractions in general are not going to be accepted.  This is a sleepy little town for a reason, the residents come here to hide from the rest of the world, not attract it.  If you want to start a legitimate business (or a money laundering one <g> both are acceptable) just remember you need money to start it.<BR>
  <BR>
 	All people aspire to own and operate their own business these are some guidelines to define how to go about the actual capitalization of your business.  Businesses are limited to the maximum amount of five members to be included as the primary income holders for the purposes of these guidelines.  The stated members must all agree to this ownership position in the body of the Story Line.<BR>
  <BR>
 	1) The minimum income/finance level necessary to start a business in Black Bayou varies depending on the type of business you intend to start.  Business partners may combine their levels to achieve the mandatory minimum levels.<BR>
 <BR>
 <B><U>               Type of Business               Region Affected        Requirements          </B></U><BR>
 	Small family owned business 		  City/Town			3 income 2 Finance<BR>
 	Medium 							     State			5 Income 4 Finance <BR>
 	Large Franchise Businesses			   National			7 Income 6 Finance<BR>
 	Corporate 							International 		9 income 8 Finance<BR>
  <BR>
  2)  The Story Line Department manager can mandate higher income and finance levels depending upon the type of business venture that is being requested.  If the levels are increased, the players can continue on with the SL and will be required to submit monthly proof to the SL Department that they are making every effort to bring their income/finance levels to the appropriate levels as defined by the SL.  Failure to make the necessary skill purchases on the part of the group can result in immediate termination of the story line.<BR>
  <BR>
  3) All Income rolls made for a Business SL must be witnessed by a HOST ANT and must be posted in the ST Lair on the Message Boards and sent to the SL Department via email or post link.<BR>
  <BR>
  When making an Income roll for your Business SL the following information should be included in the ##Command Line## .<BR>
  <BR>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>  # Income Roll - TN < > - <Dollar Amount> - <Business Name> # <BR>

  <U>Employees and their roles Within an SL<BR>
  <BR>
 </U>	</B>The Storyline Dept. has been slowly working towards the listing of different categories for employees and employers. The ruling for business lists the different level at which you wish to run your business:<BR>
  <BR>
  	Level One (City/Town)<BR>
  	Level Two (State)<BR>
  	Level Three (National)<BR>
  	Level Four (International)<BR>

  	5 managers<BR>
  	5 assistant managers<BR>
  	3 maintenance worker<BR>
  	3 accountant<BR>
  	3 computer programmer<BR>
  <BR>
  Please note the following:<BR>
  <BR>
  After Level three is level Four and that is an unlimited employee base as it is multinational. This list of employee's includes all NPC characters.<BR>
 <BR>
  *Note: In order to be an executive you must hold a position and you must have the CEO occupation.<BR>
 <BR>
 <B><U>Loans<BR>
  <BR>
 </B></U>	If you have taken a Loan from the Bank, or made a business line of credit, that was a link for your original purchase and/or start of the business expect to pay it back. The storyline dept. keeps a very close eye on these things and at the time of your renewal<every six months> you will be expected to have links to total fully one half of the loan, line of credit, amount. If you do not then you can expect on of the following things:<BR>
  <BR>
  1) Bank foreclosure warning, giving you a renewal for one month while you obtain the necessary rolls.<BR>
  <BR>
  2) A request to have a refinancing done on the original loan with an approval letter from the original lender.<BR>
  <BR>
  If these requirements cannot be met then you can expect your business to be closed and the renewal will not take place.<BR>
  <BR>
 <B><U>Permits<BR>
 </B></U>	Some storylines will require employers to submit specific permits for the business.  Anything from building permits, to ABC licenses and weapons permits may be requested to assist in the operation of your business legally. <BR>
