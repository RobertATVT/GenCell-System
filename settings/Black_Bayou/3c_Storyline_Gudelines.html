<BR>
</I>Okie, says you, what IS all this business in Black Bayou about storylines? Storylines, or SLs as we like to call them...we know, lovely hip abbreviation--this game has lots of those, but don't worry, they're all easy to follow. Here's a quick rundown, so you know what kind of stuff we're going to be referring to in this explanation.<BR>
<I><BR>
 <B>SL </B>- a storyline<BR>
 <B>PC </B>- a playing character (your character, or anybody else's personal creation)<BR>
 <B>NPC</B> - a non-playing character (a character created solely for the function of furthering a storyline or idea) The use of NPC's in the main room is not permitted.  The only people who can create and use NPC's are staff members.  NPC use is limited to filling specific roles within the game as the situation dictates. Keep this in mind when you are creating your SL. If there is a person that might have to have sometime in the Main room then your not going to want to make him/her an NPC. Try posting in the OOC boards and getting others involved it will make the game more fun for everyone.<BR>
 <B>IC </B>- in-character (what your character does and says while you're roleplaying)<BR>
 <B>OOC</B> - out-of-character (what -you- do and say, not your character)<BR>
 <B>FD </B>- the Forum Director of Black Bayou (head honcho in this game's management)<BR>
 <B>CS</B> - the Character Sheet (your character's statistics)<BR>
 <B>RP </B>- roleplaying<BR>
 <B>MB</B> - message boards (the Black Bayou message boards)<BR>
 <B>BB</B> - <g> Well... Black Bayou, of course.<BR>
<BR>
      First off, what IS a storyline? Basically, it's an idea you come up with for a direction you would like your character's experiences to go in, or an idea to give them a particular experience. For example, suppose there is a character named Joe Magicker, a lamia, who wants his mentor, Magnus, to come to town to teach a bunch of new spells to him and his friends.  Doesn't sound like a half-bad idea, right? Joe and his friends will get the benefit of Magnus' experience and learn their new spells. <BR>
     Here's another example: Lord Ruthven the vampire has fallen into a tremendous rivalry with another vampire. They hate each other. Ruthven decides to end this conflict once and for all by killing his enemy, and two of his enemy's offspring. His CS has the Vampire Lore required to kill another of his kind, and he is ready. <BR>
     ::blows the whistle:: Nope, not ready! Before you do something that is plotting to kill another character, you need to clear the plot with the FD (Forum Director) through us at the SL department. <BR>
      "Well, why?" you might ask. "What difference is there between Joe Magicker learning his new spells from an NPC (non-playing character) mentor, and Ruthven plotting to murder his enemies. They can both do whatever they want, in-character."<BR>
       This is where the concept of an SL comes in. If Joe and his friends are learning their spells, just sort of doing their own thing in RP (roleplay) and posts and not bothering anyone, that is different from Lord Ruthven seeking out certain characters to murder them deliberately--what Ruthven is doing *affects* other characters *directly*. What Joe is doing, does not. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER><B></I>~ The Criteria for Storylines ~</B><BR>
(Or - why you would have to submit a storyline for approval)<BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
      So, you wanna submit a storyline.  Dig.  We here in the department (yup, all two of us) would like you to.  After all, the game is about telling story.  Before you get this crazy idea that you think that we should look at, ask yourself a couple of questions.<BR>
<BR>
 </FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B>1)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> <B>Are there two (2) or more characters involved in the storyline?</B><BR>
     If the answer is yes, go on to the next point.  If the answer if no, lemme 'splain something here.<BR>
<BR>
      We are not accepting SLs that center on only one person.  For example, Varney Vampire has this stellar idea for his trip to New Orleans.  He's the only one going and will not encounter any supernatural creatures on this little jaunt.  It's gonna just be one uneventful trip.  Now, you might ask, well.. why don't we want to look at your SL for one?  For this reason: It does not affect the game or other characters in any major way.  There's more.. let's go to question two.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B> 2) </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>Okay, I have two (2) or more characters in my SL, and I want to blow something up, buy items from the black market, create a storm like the one Joe Magicker did, etc.. do I have to submit a storyline?</B><BR>
      Indeedy you do.  Why?  The first reason is that you are attempting to create something that will alter places, people, or things in game.  Let's go to our pal Varney for an example.<BR>
      Varney has a nifty idea now about homemade explosives (Molotov cocktails and other interesting concoctions).  He wants to use these explosives to destroy the local Sheriff's Department to break his friend Wilma Werewolf out of jail.  With the aid of some of his friends, he's going to attempt to do this.<BR>
       This needs to be known to us and the Forum Director.  Otherwise it's just not going to happen.  There's this neat idea called posting, which takes place on the message boards (MBs).  If you are going to get the ingredients you need to make a Molotov cocktail, it would need to be posted and sent to me, unfortunately, I don't have umpteen hours in the day to read everyone's post, as much as I would like.  Obviously not what you are using, we don't need that, if we want, we'll go read the Anarchist's Cookbook or something like that.  Basically, we need to let the rest of the staff know that you are planning to blow up a building, make a storm, etc.  This affects the game as a whole.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B> 3)</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B> <B>Okay.. I've got this SL and someone might die because of it, do I need to submit it?</B><BR>
      Yup, please do.  The loss of a character is something that no one ever really looks forward to, but at times needs to be done.  We'd like to know if there is a chance of this happening in anything that you submit.  While 'spur of the minute' killings happen all the time, if you are planning a long term vendetta against the Smith family, it'd be best if you let us know through an SL.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B> 4) </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>What about those NPC's? </B><BR>
    <B>  </B>NPC's or Non Player Characters should not be vital to a storyline.  We try to discourage the use of these characters and are hoping that you will involve more players in your SL and role playing as a whole. SL's that have main characters as NPC's will be extremely limited. If you need a powerful antagonist for the success of your story line, we suggest you either develop the character, or find one of the many that are in the game to work with you.  We realize this makes things difficult for some players, especially when this particular antagonist is supposed to be an all powerful force of evil for your SL. All that we can say at the moment is to develop them that way or find an existing player.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT  SIZE=5 PTSIZE=16><B> 5) </FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>I want to find a way to change breeds, can I do that?</B><BR>
     Oh, my leetle friends, it can be done.. but, you must clear it with the management of Black Bayou.  We suggest coming to us first at <A HREF="mailto:BBSTMail?subject=Breed Change Request">BBSTMail</A></FONT><FONT  COLOR="#800080" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10> </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10>where it will then be forwarded to the SL department. Keep in mind that something of this nature is life-changing to the character.  Also- no, you vampires cannot just become a mortal.  Vampires are the undead, as we all know.  If this is your heart's desire to become something new in changing your breed, please think through it carefully and have reasons to prove why this should happen. Only two breed changes per character are permitted, the only exception to this is the case of an Angel falling, or a Demon renouncing evil.  In both instances, the only breed change permissible is to Mortal.<BR>

	Alright folks, there are always new businesses and restaurants popping up in *any* city from time to time.  However we have some general rules.  Grandiose hotels/casions/tourists attractions in general are not going to be accepted.  This is a sleepy little town for a reason, the residents come here to <B>hide</B> from the rest of the world, not attract it.  If you want to start a legitimate business (or a money laundering one <g> both are acceptable) just remember you need money to start it.<BR>
<BR>
	</FONT><FONT  SIZE=4 PTSIZE=12><B>Family/Business Financing.</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10></B><BR>
<BR>
  All people aspire to own and operate their own business these are some guidelines to define how to go about the actual capitalization of your business.  These guidelines also apply to financing of expenditures made on the part of families as well.  Families and businesses are limited to the maximum amount of five members to be included as the primary income holders for the purposes of these guidelines.  The stated members must all agree to this ownership position in the body of the Story Line.<BR>
<BR>
  1. The minimum income/finance level necessary to start a business in Black Bayou is income level 7 and finance level 4.  Business partners and family members may combine their levels to achieve the mandatory minimum levels.  <BR>
<BR>
  2.  The Story Line Department manager can mandate higher income and finance levels depending upon the type of business venture/family expenditure that is being requested.  If the levels are increased, the players can continue on with the SL and will be required to submit monthly proof to the SL manager that they are making every effort to bring their income/finance levels to the appropriate levels as defined by the SL.  Failure to make the necessary skill purchases on the part of the group can result in immediate termination of the story line.<BR>
<BR>
  3.  Loan requests and grants must be submitted as an addendum to the story line with the final determination being made by the SL manager acting in the role of the Bank of Isle Voletta manager or the Small Business Bureau.  Repayment of loans and grants is a mandatory role play requirement.<BR>
<BR>
  4.  All finance/income rolls conducted for a business/family run SL must be witnessed by a GM, the Head ST, or the SL manager or assistant manager.<BR>
<BR>
	This should cover everything for now.  We are always willing to hear ideas and read submissions.  Keep in mind, there are only two of us in this department, so we might be slow from time to time.  Our door is always open and if you have a question, please ask and we'll help the best we can.<BR>
