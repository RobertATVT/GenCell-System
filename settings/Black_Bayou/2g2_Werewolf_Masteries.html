</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>The wolf is neither good nor evil as the genetic change to their system doesn't effect their overall psyche.  However, the mighty powers of the genetic change transforms a standard mortal into a hunting machine, one of the most devastating creatures Mother Nature has ever invented.  The genetic change gives the werewolf powers unknown by standard man while cursing the werewolf at the same time.  To use a mastery, werewolves tap into the power of the virus in their blood and use this power to greatly enhance the abilities of their body and mind.  Though a werewolf may not be evil, while in Horus they do not have any control over their actions and feel nothing but the blinding rage of the viral curse in full effect.   <BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> This is a description of the mastery and its effects.<BR>
<BR>
For most werewolf mastery use, you will need to do three things.  First, your character must harness the energy within required to activate the mastery.  Whether this be concentrating on a target, chanting a ritual, screaming at the top of your lungs, etc.  Then you must enter the room command.  This command is listed in parenthesis on the top line of the mastery's description. They are used to alert the host and the other players that you are using a mastery.  The other characters may not be aware of this, but their players should be.  During the duration of the mastery, you burn the fuel in order to perform it.  Therefore, once the mastery's duration is concluded you will expend the soul listed. You must decrease your character's soul statistic by each point listed to the right of the mastery's name.  The final thing you have to do is follow the rest of the description.  This is usually a dice roll and upon success, some sort of effect.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The body of the werewolf possesses a natural animal quickness, which allows them to react faster than normal.  This mastery can be used in all forms of the werewolf, as the animal within them has turned their instincts to animal based, not human.  This mastery adds +3 to all defense rolls (i.e. Evasion and Reflexes).<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B> Having such an incredible bond between pack mates, werewolves have learned to fine tune Mindspeak during times of war.  The werewolf can spend a turn shouting out a one sentence Mindspeak to each of its pack mates, regardless of distance.  Each pack mate must have the mastery Call The Pack to be included in the Mindspeak.  The pack must spend an evening attuning their minds together (and this log file must be posted) for the mastery to work.  This attunement only needs to take place once, unless a new member is added or removed.  At that point, the attunement must be renewed. The pack member must be available (online) in order to receive this call.  They may not necessarily be in their pack name SN.  It is okay to IM the message normally, but if the pack member is on an unknown SN or not online, you cannot Email the message.  Pack members are considered in 'dead zones' during these circumstances and will not receive your message.<BR>

<B>Effect/Duration:</B>  The werewolf is a confident beast in most situations.  Their predatory instincts serve them well, guiding them with strength.  They strive to overcome.  When a werewolf's mood reflects this determination, the werewolf can strengthen it's will above and beyond it's normal capacities.  The werewolf adds +4 to all will rolls they make for the rest of the scene. This confidence is removed the moment the werewolf fails any die roll for the remainder of the night, as it's confidence is now shaken. This confidence is so powerful, that the werewolf may allow others to hit him and still not shake the werewolves ego.  Loosing initiative also doesn't count as 'loosing a die roll'.<BR>

<B></I>System/Duration: </B> roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Indefinitely; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B>  The cunning wolf can sometimes blend in with its surroundings when danger is near.  For all intents and purposes, the Werewolf is considered to be totally invisible to the eye and all waves of the light spectrum, including infrared, etc.  However, even while not visible, the wolf -can- be heard and smelled, should those methods be available to others.  The werewolf will remain in this state until it drops the cover or attacks its prey.  Attacks made while under the cover of Dispas are granted a +5 bonus for surprise.  Werewolves under dispas cannot be targeted for attacks, as they cannot be seen.  Werewolves also cannot target others for attack as that would be too strenuous.  In this case, 'targeting' is the ability to use skills or masteries to enhance damage or hit a certain spot on someone.  No Aiming, Rending, Sure Shot, etc.  If a character has a Mastery that allows them to recognize hidden things (Heightened Awareness, Enhanced Senses, etc.) and they SAW the werewolf change into Dispas, they can roll their Mastery to 'see' where the werewolf is, provided the werewolf has not yet left the area.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B> Due to the werewolf's innate healing system and mind set, its body is able to handle the stress of physical attacks better than any other creature.  They are more resilient to the damage they can take before pain begins to affect their abilities.  A werewolf with Dulled Pain ignores changes to their modifiers that would normally take effect through the loss of Body for the first 3 points of damage. <BR>

System/Duration:</B>  roll<B> </B>2d6+Body vs TN 16 / Scene; takes 0 rounds to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description: </B> A werewolf shares its acute sense of hearing with its wolf cousins.  A werewolf can overhear even the quietest conversation in the noisiest room, so long as they are paying attention.  When the werewolf player mentions to the room that their character is concentrating on a spoken conversation, they are assumed to be able to hear it perfectly.  This is only true when the conversationalists are within view.  If the conversing people begin to whisper (i.e. <w>), the werewolf then makes the roll above.  If the succeed, the conversation is heard, even if they say <wvvvvvvvvq> (whispers very, very, very, very, very (etc.), quiet).  If there is a loud noise nearby (ST discretion) while this mastery is in use, the werewolf is rendered deaf for 4 rounds / 2 minutes and the effects of this mastery end immediately.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf's sense of smell is so strong and acute, that their sense of smell can sometimes compensate for their sense of sight.  Werewolves that utilize their sense of smell can effectively "see" in complete darkness.  It can distinguish between the many different scents around him and can pinpoint their exact location.  This allows the werewolf to ignore any penalties due to vision.  Strong winds or powerful smells can throw the werewolf off.  The nuances are up to the room host, ST or GM.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description: </B>The werewolf has learned to seek others out by manipulating their natural ability: Mindspeak.  This allows the werewolf to communicate via Mindspeak to a target within one mile.  For every mile after the first, a modifier of +3 is added to the target number.  The communication is only one way, unless the target also has the mastery: Extended Mindspeak.  No roll is necessary unless the werewolf is in combat.  If combat is initiated while this mastery is in effect, the werewolf must reactivate it due to the stress of combat.<BR>

<B>System/Duration:</B>  roll 2d6+Will vs TN 20 / Scene; takes 1 round to activate.<BR>
<B>Effect/Description:</B> The wolf nature grants certain benefits when it joins with the human.  Understanding of the wolf nature enables the werewolf to befriend mundane animals they encounter.  This is not open control, however.  It only makes the effected animal act friendly toward the werewolf.  Only mammals (smaller than a whale) can be affected in this manner.  If this mastery is used on another Player Character in an animal form, the target number is the victim's 2d6+Will.<BR>

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  Some Wolves have taken an extra step when it comes to confronting their own anger. In order to understand their own anger, they have learned to bring it out in others. With a touch and a force of will, the werewolf with this mastery can goad the target into a blind and all-consuming rage. If the victim is not a werewolf, they will be <I>extremely</I> angry, likely to lash out with aggression to almost any situation. If the victim of this mastery is a werewolf, they will immediately transform Horus, regardless of the phase of the moon.<BR>

</FONT><FONT  SIZE=3 PTSIZE=10><B>Effect/Description:  </B>When a werewolf finds a place outdoors that he can call home, a place to go for safety and sanctuary, he uses Homestead to solidify the area's bond to him.  The area must be natural and unaltered by man in order for this mastery to be effective, as the wolf's bond with nature does not allow for any man-made structure to be suitable.  Also, the location chosen by the wolf must be at least 100 yards from any man-made structure.  Once activated, this sanctuary grants the wolf a double healing rate for as long as he rests within the confines of his "home".  This also affects damage received from fire. In addition, Homestead cannot be breached by any being in Mist Form, Unseen,  or Spirit Form. Transcended beings -can- enter this protected area, but may not unTranscend while remaining within the boundaries of Homestead.  This does not bar people from entering his "home", only people that are not in physical form.<BR>
       Note: Homestead is considered to be the wolf's home in relation to vampires entering.<BR>

They will instantly know what the individual's breed is if they have Lore level 3 of that breed.

<B>Effect/Description:</B>  A werewolf can use the scent of others as a way of identifying them, even if they can't be seen.  This can be useful when they enter a large room and are looking for a specific person.  The werewolf will automatically recognize any scent he encounters, if it has previously memorized the scent.  Whether they are in the same room or out in an open field, the werewolf will always know if the memorized scent is near. By concentrating on a single scent, the werewolf can pick out its direction.  There is no way to mask the scent once the werewolf has memorized it.  Though people often attempt to used sealed containers or strong odors, the scent is almost more mystical in nature than physical in nature.  Only one scent may be tracked at a time and if it leads beyond a mile, a roll is required.  For every mile beyond the first, another roll is required, with a cumulative +2 to the TN.  Each level of the Tracking Skill will reduce the Scent Recognition TN by one.<BR>
